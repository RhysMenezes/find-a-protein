!~ABS~! Posttranslational lipid modifications are important for proper localization of many proteins in eukaryotic cells. However, the functional interrelationships between lipid modification processes in plants remain unclear. Here we demonstrate that the two heterotrimeric G-protein γ-subunits from Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana), AGG1 and AGG2, are prenylated, and AGG2 is S-acylated. In wild type, enhanced yellow fluorescent protein-fused AGG1 and AGG2 are associated with plasma membranes, with AGG1 associated with internal membranes as well. Both can be prenylated by either protein geranylgeranyltransferase I (PGGT-I) or protein farnesyltransferase (PFT). Their membrane localization is intact in mutants lacking PFT activity and largely intact in mutants lacking PGGT-I activity but is disrupted in mutants lacking both PFT and PGGT-I activity. Unlike in mammals, Arabidopsis Gγs do not rely on functional Gα for membrane targeting. Mutation of the sixth to last cysteine, the putative S-acylation acceptor site, causes a dramatic change in AGG2 but not AGG1 localization pattern, suggesting S-acylation serves as an important additional signal for AGG2 to be targeted to the plasma membrane. Domain-swapping experiments suggest that a short charged sequence at the AGG2 C terminus contributes to AGG2's efficient membrane targeting compared to AGG1. Our data show the large degree to which PFT and PGGT-I can compensate for each other in plants and suggest that differential lipid modification plays an important regulatory role in plant protein localization.
!~RES~! AGG1 and AGG2 contain a CaaL motif for prenylation (Fig. 1). To determine if AGG1 and AGG2 serve as prenylation targets, glutathione S-transferase (GST)-fused proteins GST-AGG2 and GST-AGG1, as well as mutant proteins GST-AGG2C97S and GST-AGG1C95S, in which the prenyl Cys was mutated to Ser, were induced and purified. Arabidopsis prenyltransferases PFT and PGGT-I were expressed and purified from yeast (Fig. 2A ). The β-subunits of PFT and PGGT were copurified with the α-subunit fused in frame with FLAG epitope at the C terminus. Incubation of purified GST-AGG2 and GST-AGG1 with different combinations of enzyme and substrate showed that the two γ-subunits are not only geranylgeranylated by PGGT-I but also farnesylated by PFT, while the mutated forms are not prenylated (Fig. 2B). The results also show that Arabidopsis PGGT-I can utilize farnesyl pyrophosphate (FPP), albeit with a much weaker signal detected. That signals were not detected when no PGGT-I was added, or when GST-AGG2C97S or GST-AGG1C95S was incubated with the purified PGGT-I, confirmed that prenylation of AGG1 and AGG2 requires the conserved fourth to last Cys, and the signals from the other reactions are not due to nonspecific substrate affinity but due to enzymatic activities. [[FIGURE]] To demonstrate that the lack of prenylation affects the localization of AGG1 and AGG2, AGG1, AGG1C95S, AGG2, and AGG2C97S were fused to EYFP at the N terminus under control of the 35S promoter of Cauliflower mosaic virus. Stable transgenic Arabidopsis plants for all the constructs as well as the EYFP vector alone were assessed by fluorescence confocal microscopy. Without other constraints, nonnuclear proteins within about 70 kD have been shown to freely enter into the nucleus through the nuclear pore complex (CITATION). EYFP (27 kD) and its variant fluorophores are cytosolic proteins that can go into the nucleus but not vacuoles (CITATION). For the EYFP vector alone, a bright signal was detected in the nuclei, perinuclear cytoplasm, cytoplasmic strands, and the cortical cytoplasm that was pressed by the large vacuole against the cell wall (Fig. 3A ). After plasmolysis, EYFP signal was detected in the condensed cytoplasm and nucleus, as shown in a guard cell for its easily recognizable shape in an overlay of differential interference contrast (DIC) and confocal image (Fig. 3B). Fluorescent signals of EYFP-AGG2 were detected as sharp, thin lines surrounding the cell periphery, suggesting that AGG2 is associated with the plasma membrane (Fig. 3C). Plasmolysis further confirmed that signals are confined to the plasma membrane (Fig. 3D). [[FIGURE]] In EYFP-AGG1 plants, the fluorescence pattern is different from both AGG2 and EYFP vector alone. While most of the EYFP-AGG1 fluorescence is detected in the plasma membrane, there is considerable signal associated with more internal structures, especially some bright, small, and motile particles (Fig. 4B ). The dynamic feature of these brightly fluorescing particles is visible in a supplemental movie (Supplemental Movie S1). After plasmolysis, EYFP-AGG1 displays aggregates of bright spots and endomembrane localization (Fig. 4C). To see if these bright dots are Golgi or Golgi-associated structures, we crossed EYFP-AGG1 plants with plants containing the Golgi marker GmMan1 fused to cyan fluorescent protein (CFP; CITATION). GmMan1-CFP plants alone exhibit weaker growth. Seeds from crosses between EYFP-AGG1 plants and GmMan1-CFP can germinate on hygromycin plates but cannot initiate true leaves. Nevertheless, using the expanded cotyledons, EYFP-AGG1 was indeed detected associated with Golgi (Fig. 4D, closeup in inset). A consistent pattern of the merged yellow color between the red (EYFP-AGG1) and green (GmMan1-CFP), indicating that EYFP-AGG1 colocalizes with GmMan1-CFP but does not overlap completely. GmMan1-CFP was shown to localize at the cis/medial side of the Golgi stacks (CITATION). Thus, it appears that EYFP-AGG1 is most likely associated with the trans side of the Golgi and possibly with the trans-Golgi network, suggesting AGG1 is transported to the plasma membrane through the vesicular membrane trafficking pathway like the human G proteins (CITATION). [[FIGURE]] Both EYFP-AGG2C97S (Fig. 3, E and F) and EYFP-AGG1C95S (Fig. 4E) showed similar localization patterns to that of EYFP-vector alone (Figs. 3, A and B, and CITATION), indicating that prenylation is critical for membrane localization of AGG2 and AGG1. We crossed EYFP-AGG2 and EYFP-AGG1 plants to ggb-2, plp-1, and era1-4 mutants to see if the AGG1 and AGG2 distribution pattern is altered in prenylation mutants. Localization of AGG2 does not change in era1-4 (Fig. 3G) or AGG1 (Fig. 4F), suggesting they are primarily prenylated by PGGT-I in vivo and loss of PFT function does not affect their prenylation. In ggb-2, AGG2 (Fig. 3H) and AGG1 (Fig. 4G) still retain most of their membrane association, indicating that loss of PGGT-I function is largely compensated by PFT, in agreement with the results from the in vitro assay. However, weakly fluorescing nuclei can be detected in the projections of multiple stacks for both AGG2 and AGG1, and for AGG1, there are fewer fluorescing Golgi stacks, indicating that a portion of AGG1 and AGG2 is not prenylated and not membrane associated in the absence of PGGT-I, further suggesting that AGG1 and AGG2 are preferably prenylated by PGGT-I but not by PFT in vivo. In plp-1 mutants, cytoplasmic strands and nuclei were clearly visualized for AGG2 (Fig. 3I) and AGG1 (Fig. 4H), indicating that AGG2 and AGG1 is significantly distributed in the cytosol when both PFT and PGGT-I activities are abolished. To show the membrane versus cytosol partitioning of the Arabidopsis G-protein γ-subunits, we prepared total, membrane, and soluble fractions of protein from leaves of the above-mentioned overexpression plants, resolved on SDS-PAGE and visualized by immunoblotting with antibodies specific for green fluorescent protein (GFP; Fig. 5 ). Consistent with confocal imaging, EYFP-AGG2 is detected in the membrane fraction in both wild-type and era1-4 mutants, and EYFP-AGG2C97S is present in the cytosolic fraction. Due to the observed lower fluorescence intensity in the ggb-2 and plp-1 mutant background, 2 times more protein was loaded for AGG2 ggb-2 and 3 times more protein was loaded for AGG2 plp-1 (see “Methods and Materials”). In ggb-2 mutants, the majority of EYFP-AGG2 remains in the membrane fraction, demonstrating that the loss of PGGT-I function does not severely alter its localization. However, in a blot with longer exposure, weak signal of EYFP-AGG2 is detected in the soluble fraction in ggb-2 but not in wild type or in era1-4 (Supplemental Fig. S1), in agreement with the faintly stained nuclei showing in the projection of the confocal image of EYFP-AGG2 ggb-2 (Fig. 3H). In plp-1 mutants, EYFP-AGG2 is significantly detected in the soluble fraction, although a portion still remains in the membrane fraction. The remaining membrane association of EYFP-AGG2 in plp-1 is resistant to 1 m of NaCl and 0.1 m of Na2CO3 wash (data not shown), suggesting that it is not due to peripheral protein-protein interaction but by stable membrane association. A similar immunoblotting pattern is observed for EYFP-AGG1, EYFP-AGG1C95S, and EYFP-AGG1 in plp-1, ggb-2, and era1-4 backgrounds (Fig. 5, bottom). [[FIGURE]] The farnesylation of mammalian Gγ2 was shown to be critical but not sufficient to target Gβγ2 to the plasma membrane. Farnesylation is sufficient to target Gβγ2 to the ER, but it requires the presence of Gα to target to the plasma membrane (CITATION). To see if Gα is necessary for Arabidopsis Gβγ to localize to the plasma membrane, we crossed Arabidopsis plants expressing EYFP-AGG1 and EYFP-AGG2 with both gpa1-1 and agb1-1. gpa1-1 is a T-DNA insertion that results in no detectable protein in western blots, and agb1-1 is a splice site mutation that introduces a stop codon early in the transcript, suggesting both are null alleles (CITATION; CITATION). No alteration of localization pattern was observed for either EYFP-AGG2 or EYFP-AGG1 in gpa1-1 or agb1-1 mutants (Fig. 4, I–L), suggesting that AGG1 and AGG2 can localize to the membrane solely through their lipid modification. In yeast Gγ, an adjacent Cys to the prenyl Cys has been shown to be palmitoylated, and palmitoylation occurs after prenylation (CITATION; CITATION). In Arabidopsis, there are two additional Cys to the prenyl Cys in AGG1 and AGG2, and one of them is separated by one amino acid upstream of the prenyl Cys (Fig. 1). To see if this Cys is subject to acylation, we conducted point mutation analysis by mutating the Cys at the 93rd position for AGG1 (AGG1C93S) and at the 95th position for AGG2 (AGG2C95S) to Ser. Because farnesylated but nonacylated human Gγ2 was only sufficiently targeted to the ER (CITATION), binary vectors containing EYFP-AGG1, EYFP-AGG2, GFP-AGG1C93S, and GFP-AGG2C95S were either infiltrated alone or coinfiltrated with an ER localization marker CFP-HDEL into Nicotiana benthamiana leaf epidermal cells. As also shown in stable transgenic plants, wild-type EYFP-AGG1 in transient assays shows many bright spots (Fig. 6G ). These bright spots were embedded within the ER network but do not colocalize with the ER marker (Fig. 6, A–C). The weakly fluorescing signal in the background suggests that, unlike farnesylated human Gγ2, geranylgeranylated EYFP-AGG1 does not significantly accumulate in the ER, and its delivery from ER to trans-Golgi is a rapid process. GFP-AGG1C93S showed a similar localization pattern to that of wild-type EYFP-AGG1 (Fig. 6, D–F). Stable transformed Arabidopsis plants with GFP-AGG1C93S (Fig. 6H) and the one that was crossed with GmMan1-CFP (Fig. 6I) also showed a similar pattern to that of EYFP-AGG1 (Fig. 4, B and D), suggesting the mutated Cys is not required for AGG1's proper targeting. [[FIGURE]] In contrast, AGG2C95S displayed a distinct pattern from that of wild-type AGG2. GFP-AGG2C95S is associated with internal membranes in both transient assays (Fig. 7, A–C ) and stable transformed Arabidopsis plants (Fig. 7E), while wild-type EYFP-AGG2 presents only sharp lines of signal circumventing the plasma membrane (Figs. 3C and 7D). Like EYFP-AGG1 and GFP-AGG1C93S, the GFP-AGG2C95S Arabidopsis plants with GmMan1-CFP are extremely unhealthy when grown on hygromycin plates and not every cell showed both signals. Within those cells that do detect both signals, the bright spots in the GFP-AGG2C95S were also shown to be associated with Golgi (Fig. 7F) in the same manner as that observed in EYFP-AGG1 (Fig. 4D) and GFP-AGG1C93S (Fig. 6I). [[FIGURE]] The fatty acid analog 2-bromo-palmitate (2-BP) is known as a palmitoylation inhibitor both in vivo and in vitro. 2-BP blocks the synthesis of acyl-CoA and also interferes with the transfer of fatty acids to the thiol group (CITATION). When EYFP-AGG2 were infiltrated into N. benthamiana along with 2-BP, a similarly disrupted pattern to that of GFP-AGG2C95S was displayed (Fig. 7H), while plasma membrane localization of EYFP-AUX1 that contains transmembrane domains (CITATION) was not altered by the same treatment (Fig. 7I), nor was the EYFP-AGG2 mock treatment with 10% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) alone (Fig. 7G). It appears that 2-BP treatment does not alter AGG1's localization, consistent with the results from the point mutation (data not shown). The disruption of the plasma membrane localization of AGG2 by both mutation of the putative S-acylated Cys and S-acylation inhibitor suggests that wild-type AGG2 is S-acylated, and S-acylation serves as an important second signal for plasma membrane targeting of the prenylated protein. Many prenylation targets, including CaM53 (CITATION) and K-RasB (CITATION), have a polybasic proximal domain that either promotes prenylation efficiency or serves as a second plasma membrane targeting signal. A polybasic region with a net positive charge of four or more is required to function as a plasma membrane targeting motif (CITATION; CITATION). A polybasic sequence with six Lys was reported to be able to facilitate palmitoylation without requiring previous prenylation (CITATION), suggesting the polybasic domain indeed serves as a membrane-targeting signal. A polybasic domain with 11 Arg and three Lys residues in CaM53 has been shown to increase PGGT-I prenylation efficiency by an order of magnitude in vitro (CITATION). Neither AGG1 nor AGG2 has a long proximal polybasic domain as does CaM53 (Fig. 1). However, AGG2 does have three more charged amino acid residues in the preceding hypervariable region than AGG1 (KEAKRCG versus NGGEGCR). We suspected this might be responsible for the observed different localization patterns between AGG1 and AGG2. We swapped the hypervariable regions of AGG1 and AGG2 proximal to the CaaX boxes (Fig. 1) and observed subcellular localization patterns of the resulting GFP-tagged proteins, AGG2m1 and AGG1m2, in N. benthamiana leaf epidermal cells and Arabidopsis transformants. AGG2m1 was associated with Golgi and other internal membranes as seen in S-acylation-diminished GFP-AGG2C95S (Fig. 8, A–C ), while wild-type AGG2 was only detected on the plasma membrane, strongly suggesting that the basic residues contribute to the efficient targeting of AGG2. Stable transformation of GFP-AGG2m1 (Fig. 8D) also displays more fluorescing internal signals than AGG2 (Fig. 8F). In contrast, the localization pattern of AGG1m2 in stable transformants (Fig. 8E) is very different from that of wild-type AGG1 (Fig. 4B) but very similar to that of AGG2 (Fig. 8F), with GFP signal mainly detected in the plasma membrane, suggesting that the added short basic sequence possibly promotes both prenylation and S-acylation process.

!~MM~! AGG1 (At3g63420) full-length cDNA was amplified with forward primer QZI1 (TTCGAATTCATGCGAGAGGAAACTGTGGTT) and reverse primer QZI2 (AGCTATGACCTCGAGTCAAAGTATTAAGCATCTGC), and AGG1C95S was amplified with QZI1 and QZI3 (AGCTATGACCTCGAGTCAAAGTATTAATGATCTGC). AGG2 (At3g22942) was amplified with QZJ1 (TTCGAATTCATGGAAGCGGGTAGCTCCAAT) and QZJ2 (AGCTATGACCTCGAGTCAAAGAATGGAGCAGCCA), and AGG2C97S was amplified with QZJ1 and QZJ3 (AGCTATGACCTCGAGTCAAAGAATGGAAGAGCCA). The PCR products were digested with EcoRI and XhoI and subcloned into pGEX-4T-1 (Pharmacia) in frame with GST and verified by sequencing. The corresponding fusion proteins (GST-AGG1, GST-AGG1C95S, GST-AGG2, and GST-AGG2C97S) were induced in E. coli XL-1 Blue and purified with glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (Pharmacia) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The full-length c-DNA of PLP (At3g59380) was amplified with QZT5 (CCGGAATTCTCGACTTTGGATCGGAGTC) and QZT6 (CCATCGATACAATTGCTGCCACTGTAATCTTG), linked as an EcoRI/ClaI fragment downstream to the GAL10 promoter of the yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) expression vector pESC-HIS (Stratagene), and verified by sequencing in frame with the FLAG epitope at the C terminus. The consequent plasmid was named pEHP. The full-length c-DNA of ERA1 (At5g40280), the β-subunit of PFT, was amplified with QZU4 (TTCCCCTCGAGTCATGCTGCTTTAAAGAA) and QZU5 (TACGGGATCCATGCCAGTAGTAACCCG), digested with BamHI/XhoI, and ligated with BamHI/SalI digested pEHP. The full-length c-DNA of GGB (At2g39550), the β-subunit of PGGT-I, was amplified with QZR1 (TTAGGATCCGAACGACGCTATGTCAGAGA) and QZR3 (TCGTAAGTCGACGACTTTGAGACAATCTAAACAT). The PCR product was directly subcloned into pCR-Blunt II-TOPO (Invitrogen/Life Technologies), digested with XbaI/EcoRV, filled in by Klenow fragment (New England Biolabs), and ligated to SmaI-digested pEHP. ERA1 and GGB were downstream of the GAL10 promoter. The resulting plasmids pFT and pGGT-I were introduced into yeast YPH499 cells by lithium acetate-mediated transformation (CITATION). Transformed cells were selected for their ability to grow on medium lacking His. Induction of protein expression was performed as described (CITATION) except for the following modifications. For medium scale protein induction, single colonies from the transformed cells were grown for 3 d with shaking (300 rpm) at 30°C in 5 mL medium consisting of 0.08% (w/v) complete supplement mixture without His (CSM-HIS, BIO101), 0.17% (w/v) yeast nitrogen base without amino acids (Difco), 0.5% (w/v) ammonium sulfate, and 2% (w/v) raffinose. Then the 5-mL culture was added into 50 mL of the same medium and continued growing for 2 d at 30°C. Cells were then collected, washed, and resuspended in 250 mL of the same medium except that the raffinose was replaced with 2% (w/v) Gal for induction of protein expression for 24 h. Spheroplast and crude protein were prepared using CelLytic Y Plus (product no. PCYP-1, Sigma). PFT and PGGT-I were purified using EZviewRed ANTI-FLAG M2 Affinity gel (product no. F2426, Sigma) and eluted with 3× FLAG peptide (product no. F4799, Sigma) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The eluted enzyme was stored at −80°C for further use. In vitro prenylation assays were performed as described (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION; CITATION). The reactions consisted of 2 μg of purified GST-AGG2, GST-AGG2C97S, GST-AGG1, or GST-AGG1C95S, 10 ng of purified recombinant Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) PFT or PGGT-I, 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 5 mm MgCl2, 50 μm ZnCl2, 0.2% (w/v) glucopyranoside, 5 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 μL of either [1-3H]FPP (1 mCi mL−1) or [1-3H]GGPP (1 mCi mL−1, both from American Radiological Company) in a total volume of 20 μL. The reactions were preequilibrated at 30°C for 5 min before adding prenyl substrates and incubated for 90 min afterward, resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE, and analyzed by fluorography using Autofluor fluorographic reagent (National Diagnostics) and Kodak XAR film (Eastman Kodak). The AGG1 cDNA was amplified using primer sets QZI4 (ATACATAAGCTTTCATGCGAGAGGAAACTGT) and QZI5 (CGTTGCTCTAGATCAAAGTATTAAGCATCTGCA), and reverse primer QZI6 (CGTTGCTCTAGATCAAAGTATTAAAGATCTGCA) was used to change the fourth to last Cys in AGG1 to Ser. The AGG2 cDNA was amplified using QZJ4 (ATACATAAGCTTTCATGGAAGCGGGTAGCT) and QZJ5 (CGTTGCTCTAGATCAAAGAATGGAGCAGC), and reverse primer QZJ6 (CGTTGCTCTAGATCAAAGAATGGAAGAGC) was used to mutate the fourth to last Cys in AGG2 to Ser. The PCR products were subcloned into pCR-Blunt II-TOPO (Invitrogen/Life Technologies) and ligated as a HindIII/XbaI fragment into pCAM-EYFP-C1 (CITATION), a pCAMBIA-(CAMBIA) based plant expression vector. The cDNAs are in frame with EYFP at the N terminus under the control of the 35S promoter of Cauliflower mosaic virus. The corresponding constructs pEYFP-AGG1, pEYFP-AGG1C95S, pEYFP-AGG2, and pEYFP-AGG2C97S were transformed into Agrobacterium tumefaciens C58 by electroporation. AGG1C93S was amplified by QZY41 (CACCATGCGAGAGGAAACTGTGGTTTACGA) and QZY42 (TCAAAGTATTAAGCATCTAGAGCCTTCTCCTCCA). AGG1m2 was amplified by QZY41 and QZY47 (TCAAAGTATTAAGCAGCCACATCGTTTTGCTTCTTTTGGTCCTTCAAACCA). AGG2C95S was amplified by QZY43 (CACCATGGAAGCGGGTAGCTCCAATTCGTC) and QZY44 (CACCATGGAAGCGGGTAGCTCCAATTCGTC). AGG2m1 was amplified by QZY43 and QZY48 (TCAAAGAATGGAGCATCTGCAGCCTTCTCCTCCATTAGGGCCTTCGAACCA). The AGG1C93S, AGG1m2, AGG2C95S, and AGG2m1 were introduced into pENTR/d-TOPO (Invitrogen/Life Technologies) and then into destination vector pMDC43 (CITATION). The corresponding binary vector GFP-AGG1C93S, GFP-AGG1m2, GFP-AGG2C95S, and GFP-AGG2m1 was transformed into C58. Arabidopsis plants were transformed by the floral dip method (CITATION). Transient assay in Nicotiana benthamiana is through leaf infiltration. This experiment essentially follows that of CITATION. Lower epidermal layers of N. benthamiana leaves were infiltrated with the induced Agrobacteria C58 harboring EYFP-AGG1, EYFP-AGG2, and EYFP-AUX1 (CITATION) along with 1 mm of palmitoylation inhibitor 2-BP (Arcros) dissolved in 10% DMSO or 10% DMSO alone. Fluorescence signals were observed 24 h later. plp-1 (CITATION), era1-4 (previously known as wig-1; CITATION), ggb-2 (CITATION), gpa1-1(CITATION), and agb1-1 (CITATION) mutants were previously described. EYFP-AGG2 plp-1, EYFP-AGG2 ggb-2, EYFP-AGG2 era1-4, EYFP-AGG1 gpa1-1, EYFP-AGG1 agb1-1, EYFP-AGG2 gpa1-1, and EYFP-AGG2 agb1-1 were generated by crossing EYFP-AGG2 transgenic plants with their respective single mutant, allowing the hygromycin-resistant F1 plants to self fertilize and screening F2 plants on one-fourth strength Murashige and Skoog plates with 30 mg/L of hygromycin and further selected by confocal imaging. Then EYFP-containing mutants were screened either by their obvious phenotypes or PCR screening if there were no apparent phenotypes, as in EYFP-AGG2 ggb-2. Arabidopsis seeds expressing GmMan1-CFP (CITATION) were crossed with EYFP-AGG1, GFP-AGG1C93S, and GFP-AGG2C95S and F1 seeds were used for observation of colocalization. Arabidopsis plants were grown on the farfat soil in the greenhouse at 22°C under long-day conditions (15 h 150 μE light and 9 h dark) and 50% humidity. N. benthamiana was grown at 27°C under long-day conditions. Cotyledons or leaf lower epidermal cells of transgenic plants or transiently infiltrated N. benthamiana with EYFP, GFP, or CFP signal were imaged using a Zeiss LSM 510 confocal/multiphoton microscope equipped with a 40× DIC lens that allows simultaneous acquisition of confocal, multiphoton, and transmitted light images. Colocalization of EYFP or GFP with CFP was taken under multitrack options with one channel set up for EYFP or GFP and another channel set up for CFP. To observe the signal distribution after plasmolysis, leaf sections were immersed in 30% Suc for 2 h. Images were finalized by Adobe Photoshop 7.0. Proteins were prepared according to CITATION. A total of 0.2 g of leaf tissues was ground in 0.6 mL of cold buffer containing 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 1× complete protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science). The homogenate was transferred to a 2-mL tube and spun at 6,000g for 5 min at 4°C, and 0.4 mL of postnuclear supernatant (PNS) was collected as total protein and 0.2 mL of PNS was fractionated at 100,000g at 4°C for 1 h. The supernatant (soluble fraction) was collected. The pellet was resuspended in 200 μL of 1× loading buffer. An equal volume of 2× loading buffer was added to both the saved PNS (total protein) and soluble fraction. Samples were boiled for 10 min and spun for 2 min. Five microliters of the above sample from YFP-vector control, 10 μL from YFP-AGG2, EYFP-AGG2C97S, and YFP-AGG2 era1-4, 15 μL from EYFP-AGG2 ggb-2, and 30 μL from EYFP-AGG2 plp-1 was loaded onto 4% to 15% SDS-PAGE gradient gel (Bio-Rad) and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Bio-Rad) for immunodetection with monoclonal anti-GFP (mouse IgG2a isotype, cat no. 8371, CLONTECH) and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse secondary antibody (NA931-1ML, Amersham Biosciences). For AGG1, 1 μL of YFP-vector control, 10 μL from YFP-AGG1 and YFP-AGG1 era1-4, 30 μL from EYFP-AGG1C95S, EYFP-AGG1 ggb-2, and EYFP-AGG1 plp-1 was loaded onto 4% to 15% SDS-PAGE gradient gel. Signals were detected by exposing Kodak XAR film (Eastman Kodak) to the membrane after applying ECL western Blotting Substrate (Pierce). The following materials are available in the online version of this article. Supplemental Figure S1. Immunoblotting using GFP-specific monoclonal antibody. Supplemental Movie S1. EYFP-AGG1 is detected associated with motile subcellular organelles.
