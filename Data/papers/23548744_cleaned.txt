!~ABS~! PHYTOCHROME INTERACTING FACTOR3 (PIF3) is a key basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor of Arabidopsis thaliana that negatively regulates light responses, repressing chlorophyll biosynthesis, photosynthesis, and photomorphogenesis in the dark. However, the mechanism for the PIF3-mediated transcription regulation remains largely unknown. In this study, we found that the REDUCED POTASSIUM DEPENDENCY3/HISTONE DEACETYLASE1-type histone deacetylase HDA15 directly interacted with PIF3 in vivo and in vitro. Genome-wide transcriptome analysis revealed that HDA15 acts mainly as a transcriptional repressor and negatively regulates chlorophyll biosynthesis and photosynthesis gene expression in etiolated seedlings. HDA15 and PIF3 cotarget to the genes involved in chlorophyll biosynthesis and photosynthesis in the dark and repress gene expression by decreasing the acetylation levels and RNA Polymerase II–associated transcription. The binding of HDA15 to the target genes depends on the presence of PIF3. In addition, PIF3 and HDA15 are dissociated from the target genes upon exposure to red light. Taken together, our results indicate that PIF3 associates with HDA15 to repress chlorophyll biosynthetic and photosynthetic genes in etiolated seedlings.
!~RES~! It was reported that PIF3 may act as a negative regulator in the gene expression involved in chlorophyll biosynthesis and photosynthesis (CITATION; CITATION). Many transcription repressors were found to regulate their target genes by recruiting HDACs (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION). Therefore, we examined whether PIF3 could directly interact with the HDACs by yeast two-hybrid assays. We found that PIF3 directly interacted with a RPD3/HDA1-type HDAC, HDA15, but not other HDACs in yeast cells (Figures 1A and 1B; see Supplemental Figure 1A online). Further deletion analyses identified that the N-terminal domain of HDA15 (amino acids 1 to 146) and the N-terminal domain of PIF3 (amino acids 40 to 126) were responsible for their interaction in yeast cells (Figures 1A and 1B). By contrast, HDA15 did not interact with PIF4 and PIF5 in yeast cells (see Supplemental Figure 1B online). These data indicate that HDA15 specifically interacts with PIF3. [[FIGURE]] We further analyzed the interaction between HDA15 and PIF3 by pull-down assays. Purified PIF3-His recombinant protein was incubated with glutathione S-transferase (GST)-HDA15 fusion protein. PIF3-His was pulled down by GST-HDA15 (Figure 1C). Furthermore, PIF3-His recombinant protein was also incubated with HDA15-GFP (for green fluorescent protein) from total protein extracts of etiolated seedlings. In vivo HDA15-GFP protein was also pulled down by recombinant PIF3-His (Figure 1D). These data also support that HDA15 interacts with PIF3. The interaction of HDA15 and PIF3 was further studied in vivo by the bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) assay. HDA15 and PIF3 were fused to the N-terminal 174–amino acid portion of yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) in the pEarleyGate201 vector and C-terminal 66–amino acid portion of YFP in the pEarleyGate202 vector (CITATION), respectively. The constructs were codelivered into Arabidopsis protoplasts and then incubated in darkness or under red light (RL) for 12 h. Strong YFP signal was observed in the nucleus of dark-incubated Arabidopsis protoplasts, while no obvious signal was detected in the protoplasts incubated under RL conditions, suggesting that HDA15 and PIF3 interact in dark conditions only (Figure 1E). The corresponding fusion gene constructs were also codelivered into tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) leaves by infiltration with Agrobacterium tumefaciens (GV3101). The direct interaction between HDA15 and PIF3 was also observed in the nuclei of tobacco epidermal cells in dark (see Supplemental Figure 2 online). We also performed coimmunoprecipitation assays in 35S:PIF3-MYC transgenic plants (CITATION). PIF3-MYC was coimmunoprecipitated with endogenous HDA15 in 2-d-old etiolated seedlings (Figure 1F). However, this interaction became weaker when the seedlings were exposed to RL for 10 min and almost disappeared after 2 h RL exposure. Taken together, our data suggest that HDA15 interacts with PIF3 only in dark conditions in Arabidopsis. Recombinant HDA15 produced in Escherichia coli did not show measurable HDAC activity. Therefore, we purified GFP-tagged HDA15 from 2-d-old etiolated seedlings or seedlings transferred to RL light for 2 h using transgenic Arabidopsis expressing the HDA15-GFP chimeric gene driven by the cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter (Figure 2A). A prominent polypeptide migrated on a SDS-PAGE gel at the predicted size of 86 kD and was absent in nontransgenic and 35S:GFP plants (Figure 2A). HDAC activities were evaluated using a colorimetric assay. The HeLa nuclear extract that contains a blend of HDACs served as the positive control, while the HDAC inhibitor trichostatin A (TSA) was also added to demonstrate the specificity of deacetylation activities. As shown in Figure 2B, purified HDA15-GFP protein from both etiolated seedlings and seedlings exposed to RL clearly showed the HDAC activity. These data suggest that HDA15 has HDAC activity and that the activity is not affected by light. [[FIGURE]] We also used 35S:HDA15-GFP transgenic plants to examine the subcellular localization of HDA15 (see Supplemental Figures 3A and 3B online). We observed that HDA15-GFP protein was localized in the nucleus of 4-d-old etiolated seedlings both in dark and white light conditions (see Supplemental Figure 3A online). When etiolated HDA15-GFP seedlings were transferred to RL for 10, 30, or 120 min, the HDA15-GFP proteins were also localized in the nucleus (see Supplemental Figure 3B online). These data indicated that HDA15 is constitutively localized in the nucleus in both dark and light conditions in Arabidopsis seedlings. A previous study indicated that HDA15 can undergo the nuclear-cytoplasm shuttling driven by light in Arabidopsis protoplasts using a transient assay (CITATION), suggesting that HDA15 may also be localized in the cytoplasm under different conditions. To further investigate the function of HDA15, a T-DNA insertion mutant, hda15-1 (SALK_004027), and two RNA interference (RNAi) lines (CS30922 and CS30923) were analyzed. The T-DNA was inserted in the second exon of HDA15, and no HDA15 transcript was detected in the homozygous hda15-1 plants (Figures 3A and 3B). Furthermore, the expression of HDA15 mRNA in the two RNAi lines CS30922 and CS30923 was markedly decreased compared with the wild type (Figure 3C). We also generated the hda15 pif3 double mutants by crossing hda15-1 and pif3-1 (CITATION) to investigate the genetic interaction between HDA15 and PIF3. [[FIGURE]] The protochlorophyllide contents in etiolated hda15-1 and RNAi plants were measured (CITATION). Etiolated hda15-1, hda15 pif3, and HDA15 RNAi seedlings accumulated a relative higher amount of protochlorophyllide compared with the wild type (Figures 3D and 3E), suggesting that HDA15 may negatively regulate protochlorophyllide biosynthesis in the dark. Etiolated seedlings that accumulate abnormally high levels of chlorophyll intermediates are bleached when transferred to the light (CITATION). We grew Columbia (Col) wild type, hda15-1, pif3-1, and hda15 pif3 for several days in the dark and then transferred into white light. The greening rate of hda15-1 was lower than that of the wild type after 4 d or longer of dark treatment (Figure 3F). The hda15 pif3 double mutant showed an even lower greening rate compared with hda15-1 and pif3-1 single mutants, with almost all the seedlings became bleached when grew 5 d or longer in the dark (Figure 3F). These data suggest that hda15 mutants accumulate a higher level of chlorophyll intermediates than the wild type. The observed phenotype prompted us to test whether HDA15 regulates the expression of the genes involved in the chlorophyll biosynthetic pathway (see Supplemental Figure 4 online). CHLD and GUN5 encode the CHL D and CHL H subunit of the Mg2+-chelatase enzyme complex, the first enzyme in the chlorophyll biosynthetic branch in the tetrapyrrole pathway (CITATION), whereas CRD1 encodes a putative di-iron enzyme that is required for the biosynthesis of protochlorophyllide from Mg-protoporphyrin IX ME (CITATION). The expression of CHLD, GUN5, and CRD was upregulated (>1.5-fold to Col) in the 2-d-etiolated seedlings of hda15 mutants compared with the wild type (see Supplemental Figure 4 online), suggesting that HDA15 may repress the expression of the chlorophyll biosynthetic genes. The upregulation of CHLD, GUN5, and CRD1 in hda15-1 indicated that HDA15 may repress the conversion from protoporphyrin IX to protochlorophyllide in the chlorophyll biosynthetic pathway. A recent study suggested that PIF3 may act as a negative regulator of chlorophyll biosynthesis by repressing genes required for chlorophyll biosynthesis, such as CHLD and GUN5 in the dark (CITATION). We further compared the expression levels of CHLD and GUN5 in etiolated hda15, pif3, and hda15 pif3 mutants. Compared with the wild type, the transcript levels of CHLD and GUN5 were all increased in 2-d-etiolated hda15, pif3, and double mutants (Figure 3G). The hda15 pif3 double mutants showed highest expression of CHLD and GUN5, which is in accordance with the relatively high amount of protochlorophyllide in etiolated hda15 pif3 seedlings (Figure 3F). These data indicate that both HDA15 and PIF3 repress the gene expression involved in chlorophyll biosynthetic pathways. To further explore the roles of HDA15 in etiolated seedlings, we analyzed the global gene expression profiles of 2-d-old etiolated hda15-1 seedlings using an Affymetrix microarray (ATH1). Compared with the wild type, 520 genes were upregulated but only 192 genes were downregulated in hda15-1 seedlings (see Supplemental Data Sets 1A and 1B online), suggesting that HDA15 may act mainly as a transcriptional repressor in etiolated seedlings. The genes affected by the hda15 mutation are involved in a variety of biological processes, including the following Gene Ontology categories: metabolic process, transcription, response to stimulus, photosynthesis, transport, protein phosphorylation, biosynthetic process, developmental process, translation, cellular process, and nucleic acid metabolic process (see Supplemental Data Sets 1A and 1B and Supplemental Figures 5A and 5B online), indicating that HDA15 plays important roles in regulation of growth and developmental processes in Arabidopsis. We compared the gene expression profiles of the hda15 and pif1 pif3 pif4 pif5 quadruple (pifQ) mutants (CITATION; CITATION). Of the 520 induced genes in hda15, 62 (∼12%) genes were also upregulated in the pifQ mutant (see Supplemental Table 1 online). Most of the light-responsive genes regulated by HDA15 were also upregulated in etiolated pifQ mutants (Figure 4A). The transcripts of a large subset of photosynthetic genes were elevated in hda15, including PSAE1, PSAE2, PSAF, PSAK, PSAO, LHCB2.2, LHCA6, LHCB5, LHCB4.2, LHCB4.1, and LHB1B2 (Figure 4A; see Supplemental Table 1 online). PSAE1, PSAE2, PSAF, PSAK, PSBQ, and PSAO encode the subunits of photosystem I, whereas the others encode the subunits of light harvesting complexes of photosystems I and II. The expression patterns of these genes were further confirmed by quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) (see Supplemental Figure 5C online). [[FIGURE]] We also analyzed the transcript levels of some of the HDA15-regulated light-responsive genes in etiolated pif3-1 and hda15 pif3 seedlings. Similar to hda15-1, the expression of LHCB2.2, LHCB4.2, LHCB6, PSBQ, PSAE1, and PSAK was also upregulated in pif3-1 and hda15 pif3 seedlings (Figure 4B). Compared with the single mutants, increased expression of LHB1B2, LHCB6, PSAE2, PSAK, and PSBQ in hda15 pif3 double mutants was observed, suggesting that HDA15 and PIF3 may act synergistically in the regulation of gene expression. Taken together, these data suggested that both HDA15 and PIF3 function as repressors of photosynthetic genes in etiolated seedlings. To evaluate whether the high expression of GUN5, LHCB2.2, PSBQ, and PSAE1 in hda15-1 and pif3-1 seedlings is related to histone modifications, we determined the histone acetylation levels of these genes by ChIP assays. The histone H4 acetylation levels of the promoters and exons of GUN5, LHCB2.2, PSBQ, and PSAE1 were elevated in hda15, pif3, and hda15 pif3 mutants (Figures 5A and 5B). By contrast, the nuclear occupancy of these genes was not changed (see Supplemental Figure 6 online). These data suggest that both HDA15 and PIF3 may repress gene expression by deceasing histone acetylation levels. [[FIGURE]] We further analyzed RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) occupancy on GUN5, LHCB2.2, PSBQ, and PSAE1 in etiolated hda15, pif3, and hda15 pif3 mutants by ChIP assays using an anti-RNAPII antibody. A relatively higher enrichment of RNAPII binding to the transcriptional starting sites and exons was observed in hda15, pif3, and hda15 pif3 mutants compared with the wild type (Figure 5C), suggesting that HDA15 and PIF3 repress RNAPII-associated transcription in etiolated seedlings. Taken together, our data indicate that both HDA15 and PIF3 repress the transcription of chlorophyll biosynthetic and photosynthetic genes by decreasing histone acetylation and RNAPII-associated transcription in etiolated seedlings. Genome-wide transcription and ChIP analysis revealed that HDA15 and PIF3 coregulate a large subset of chlorophyll biosynthetic and photosynthetic genes. To examine whether these genes are direct targets of HDA15 and PIF3, ChIP assays were performed using transgenic lines expressing YFP-tagged PIF3 (YFP-PIF3) (CITATION), MYC-tagged PIF3 (PIF3-MYC) (CITATION), and MYC-tagged HDA15 (HDA15-MYC) (see Supplemental Figures 7A and 7B online). Overexpression of 35S:HDA15-MYC in hda15-1 can complement the protochlorophyllide defect phenotype (see Supplemental Figure 7C online), suggesting that the HDA15-MYC protein is functional in vivo. ChIP analyses in etiolated PIF3-MYC and YFP-PIF3 seedlings showed that PIF3 specifically bound to the G-box regions of GUN5, LHCB2.2, PSBQ, and PSAE1 in etiolated seedlings (Figures 6A and 6B). Similar to a previous study (CITATION), we also found that PIF3 bound to the promoter of PIL1 (Figure 6B). Furthermore, the G-box regions of GUN5, LHCB2.2, PSBQ, and PSAE1 were also direct binding sites of HDA15 (Figure 6C). As a control, we analyzed SAG20 and CSD1, two unrelated genes upregulated in hda15 based on the microarray and qRT-PCR analysis (see Supplemental Data Set 1A and Supplemental Figure 8A online). SAG20 and CSD1 were not direct binding targets of HDA15 (see Supplemental Figure 8B online). These data suggest that HDA15 and PIF3 may specifically cotarget to the promoters of chlorophyll biosynthetic and photosynthetic genes in etiolated seedlings. [[FIGURE]] To further investigate whether the binding of HDA15 to the target genes is dependent on the presence of PIF3, we performed ChIP assays with an anti-HDA15 antibody using 2-d-old etiolated Col, hda15-1, and pif3-1 seedlings. Much lower enrichment of HDA15 protein in the promoters of GUN5, LHCB2.2, PSBQ, and PSAE1 was detected in hda15-1 seedlings compared with the wild type (Figure 6D), confirming that these genes are the direct targets of HDA15. Furthermore, relatively lower enrichment of HDA15 protein in the promoters of GUN5, LHCB2.2, PSBQ, and PSAE1 was also detected in pif3-1 (Figure 6D), suggesting that the association of HDA15 with the promoters of light-responsive genes is dependent on PIF3. Previous studies showed that light triggers activated forms of phytochromes and induces rapid phosphorylation and degradation of PIF3 (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION; CITATION), indicating that PIF3 and its interacting proteins may be disassociated from their target genes upon exposure to light. We analyzed the binding of PIF3 and HDA15 to their target genes during seedling deetiolation. We first checked the protein levels of HDA15-MYC and PIF3-MYC in the transgenic lines grown for 2 d in darkness and then exposed to RL. The protein level of HDA15 was not changed (Figure 7A), suggesting that HDA15 protein was stable during dark-to-light conversion. In PIF3-MYC transgenic plants, a band of a larger molecular mass appeared immediately after Rp exposure, which may represent the phosphorylated form of PIF3 (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION; CITATION). The phosphorylated PIF3 was degraded 2 h after transfer to RL (Figure 7A). [[FIGURE]] We used ChIP assays to examine whether PIF3 and HDA15 could still bind to GUN5, LHCB2.2, PSAE1, and PSBQ when etiolated seedlings were exposed to RL. Compared with the strong binding of PIF3 and HDA15 to the promoters of the target genes (Figure 6) in dark-grown seedlings, there was no difference in the relative enrichment of PIF3 and HDA15 among the transgenic plants (PIF3-MYC and HDA15-MYC) and wild-type plants after 2 h RL exposure (Figure 7B), suggesting that PIF3 and HDA15 proteins were dissociated from the target genes after light exposure. We also detected the expression levels of the early light-inducible genes, GUN5, PSAE1, LHB1B1, and LHCB6, in wild-type seedlings after RL exposure. The transcription of these genes was upregulated after transfer to RL for 2 h (Figure 7C). ChIP analysis showed that H3 and H4 acetylation levels in the promoters of these genes were enriched after 2 h RL (Figure 7D). Collectively, our data suggest that light dissociates HDA15 and PIF3 from their target genes, resulting in increased histone acetylation and gene expression. We further studied the phenotype of hda15 mutants under various light conditions. Phenotypic analysis showed that hda15-1 and HDA15 RNAi seedlings exhibited relative longer hypocotyls than the wild type under RL and FR conditions (Figure 8; see Supplemental Figure 9 online), indicating that HDA15 might positively regulate PHYA- and PHYB-mediated inhibition of hypocotyl elongation. Previous studies demonstrated that PIF3 is a negative regulator of PHYB- but not PHYA-mediated inhibition of hypocotyl elongation (CITATION). We further studied whether HDA15 and PIF3 interact genetically to regulate hypocotyl elongation under various light conditions. Similar to the results from previous studies (CITATION), the pif3 mutants had shorter hypocotyls under RL compared with the wild type. hda15 pif3 double mutants showed an intermediate hypocotyl length compared with hda15-1 and pif3-1 seedlings under RL (Figure 8), suggesting that HDA15 might act independently of PIF3 in regulation of PHYB-mediated inhibition of hypocotyl elongation. When grown under FR, the hypocotyl length of pif3 was similar to that of the wild type, whereas the hypocotyl length of hda15 pif3 was similar to that of hda15. Taken together, these data suggest that HDA15 and PIF3 may independently regulate hypocotyl elongation in seedlings growth. [[FIGURE]] A previous study showed that mutations of HDA19 in Arabidopsis resulted in a short-hypocotyl phenotype under RL and FR (CITATION), indicating a negative role of HDA19 in PHYA- and PHYB-mediated inhibition of hypocotyl elongation. We generated hda15 hda19 double mutants by genetic crossing hda15-1 and hda19-3 (CITATION). hda15 hda19 seedlings showed intermediate hypocotyl lengths compared with hda15 and hda19 single mutants under RL and FR conditions (see Supplemental Figure 10 online), suggesting that HDA15 and HDA19 may act antagonistically in regulation of hypocotyl elongation. These data suggest that different HDACs may have distinct functions in hypocotyl growth.
!~MM~! The hda15 T-DNA mutant hda15-1 (SALK_004027), HDA15 RNAi lines (CS30922 and CS30923), hda19-3 (SALK_139443), and pif3-1 (SALK_030753) were obtained from the ABRC (http://www.Arabidopsis.org/). hda15-1, hda19-3, and pif3-1 are in the Col background, whereas HDA15 RNAi lines are in the Wassilewskija background. 35S:PIF3-MYC and PIF3:YFP-PIF3 transgenic lines used in this study were described previously (CITATION; CITATION). For 35S:HDA15-MYC and 35S:HDA15-GFP transgenic lines, the full-length cDNA of HDA15 was subcloned into pN-TAP (CD3-679) (CITATION) and PK7WGF2 (CITATION) binary vectors separately, and transgenic plants were generated using the floral dip method (CITATION). Arabidopsis thaliana plants were grown under long-day conditions (16-h-light/8-h-dark cycle) at 22°C. For measurement of morphogenetic phenotypes, seeds were plated on half-strength Murashige-Skoog medium (Sigma-Aldrich) agar plates containing 0.3% Suc and imbibed for 3 d at 4°C in the dark. After germination was induced under white light for 6 h (100 µmol m−2 s−1), the seedlings were grown in various light conditions at 22°C for 4 d. The full-length coding sequence of HDA15 was cloned into pGEX-4T-3 (GE Healthcare) and transformed into Escherichia coli strain BL21 (DE3). The recombinant proteins were affinity purified using Glutathione Sepharose 4B beads (GE Healthcare). GST fusion proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE. Bands of interest were excised and used as antigens for antibody production. Antibodies were produced in rabbit and mouse by Genomics BioSci and Tech. Total RNA was extracted with Trizol reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s protocol and used to synthesize cDNA. The gene-specific primers used for real-time PCR are listed in Supplemental Table 2 online. Each sample was quantified at least in triplicate and normalized using Ubiquitin10 (UBQ10) as an internal control. Surface-sterilized seeds of the wild-type Col and hda15-1 mutant were plated on half-strength Murashige and Skoog agar plates containing 0.3% Suc and imbibed for 3 d at 4°C in the dark. After germination was induced under white light for 6 h (100 µmol m−2 s−1), the seedlings were grown in darkness at 22°C for 48 h. Total RNA was extracted as described (CITATION). cDNA and cRNA synthesis and hybridization to 22K Affymetrix Gene Chips (ATH1) were performed according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Microarray assays were performed with triplicate biological samples. Raw data were processed with Affymetrix Microarray Suite 5.0, and the resulting CEL files were further analyzed using Genespring V11.5 (Agilent Technologies). We employed a false discovery rate set at 5% to identify the up- and downregulated genes. Genes with 1.5-fold expression difference between the wild type and hda15-1 mutant with statistically significance (P value < 0.05) were selected. The up- or downregulated genes were classified with Gene Ontology analysis. Protochlorophyllide content was measured as described (CITATION). Briefly, 10 frozen 4-d-old etiolated seedlings were ground with a Mixer-mill, and pigments were extracted by gently agitating the seedling powder in 1 mL of cold 80% acetone in opaque tubes for 1 h in the dark at 4°C. After centrifugation at 4°C for 10 min, the supernatant was collected and the relative fluorescence was measured with a fluorescence spectrophotometer. The excitation wavelength was 440 nm, and the fluorescence emission spectra were recorded between 600 and 800 nm a bandwidth of 5 nm. To determine the greening rate, more than 50 seedlings were grown in darkness for the indicated number of days after germination and transferred into continuous white light (100 µmol m−2 s−1) for 2 d. The seedlings can be classified into two types: normal greening (with dark-green cotyledons) and impaired greening (with white, yellow, or light-green cotyledons). The greening rate was calculated by the percentage of normal greening seedlings (CITATION). ChIP assays were performed as described (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION). Chromatin was extracted from 2-d-old dark grown seedlings. After fixation with formaldehyde, the chromatin was sheared to an average length of 500 bp by sonication and then immunoprecipitated with specific antibodies including anti-c-myc (A-14) (catalog number sc-789; Santa Cruz), anti-GFP (catalog number 11814460001; Roche), anti-acetyl-histone H3 (catalog number 06-599; Millipore), anti-acetyl-histone H4 (catalog number 06-866; Millipore), anti-RNAPII (catalog number sc-33754; Santa Cruz), and anti-H4 (catalog number 05-858; Millipore). The cross-linking was then reversed, and the amount of each precipitated DNA fragment was determined by real-time PCR using specific primers (see Supplemental Table 2 online). Yeast two-hybrid assays were performed according to the instructions for the Matchmaker GAL4-based two-hybrid system 3 (Clontech). Constructs were generated by cloning the full-length or deletion fragments of HDA15 and PIF3 cDNAs into pGADT7 and pGBKT7 vectors. All constructs were transformed into yeast strain AH109 by the lithium acetate method, and yeast cells were grown on minimal medium/-Leu-Trp according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Transformed colonies were plated onto minimal medium/-Leu/Trp-His/x-α-gal containing 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole to test for possible interactions. The GST pull-down assay was performed as described previously with some modifications (CITATION; CITATION). GST and GST-HDA15 recombinant proteins were incubated with 30 mL of GST resin in a binding buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mM NaCl, 0.25% Triton X-100, and 35 mM β-mercaptoethanol) for 2 h at 4°C, the binding reaction was washed three times with the binding buffer and then the PIF3-His recombinant protein was added and incubated for an additional 2 h at 4°C. After extensive washing (at least five times), the pulled-down proteins were eluted by boiling, separated by 10% SDS-PAGE, and detected by immunoblotting using an anti-His antibody. PIF3-His recombinant protein (0.25 µg) was added to 1 mL of pull-down buffer with 50 μL of Nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid (Ni-NTA) agarose, and the mixtures were preincubated at 4°C for 1 h. One milligram of soluble plant total proteins extracted from Col or 35S:HDA15-GFP seedlings grown in the dark for 2 d was added into the mixtures and incubated for 3 h. After washing three times, the pull down proteins were detected by immunoblotting using an anti-GFP antibody. Full-length cDNA fragments of HDA15 and PIF3 were subcloned into the pCR8/GW/TOPO vectors and then recombined into the YN (pEarleyGate201-YN) and YC (pEarleyGate202-YC) vectors (CITATION). The constructed vectors were transformed into Arabidopsis protoplasts by polyethylene glycol for transient expression (CITATION). Transfected cells were imaged using a TCS SP5 confocal spectral microscope imaging system (Leica). To detect the interaction in tobacco, leaves of 2- to 4-week-old tobacco plants (Nicotiana benthamiana) were infiltrated with Agrobacterium tumefaciens strains (GV3101) containing HDA15 and PIF3 BiFC construct pairs. Epidermal cell layers were examined 3 to 4 d after infiltration using the YFP filter. Total proteins were extracted from 2-d-etiolated Col, hda15, and PIF3-MYC seedlings or seedlings exposed to RL (10 µmol m−2 s−1) for 10 min, 30 min, and 2 h in an extraction buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 2 mM MgCl2, 1 mM DTT, 20% glycerol, and 1% CA-630) containing protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche). Protein extracts were incubated with rabbit polyclonal anti-HDA15 antibody overnight at 4°C and then protein G Mag Sepharose beads (GE Healthcare) were added. After incubation for 2 h at 4°C, the beads were centrifuged and washed four times with a wash buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 2 mM MgCl2, 1 mM DTT, 10% glycerol, and 1% CA-630). The immunoprecipitated proteins were detected by SDS-PAGE gel with an anti-myc antibody. Endogenous HDA15 protein was detected with a mouse polyclonal anti-HDA15 antibody after immunoprecipitation with anti-HDA15 Rb. Input PIF3-MYC protein was detected with an anti-myc antibody. HDA15-GFP was purified according to the manual for the Magnetic GFP-Trap (ChromoTek). Soluble total proteins extracted from Col, 35S:GFP, or 35S:HDA15-GFP seedlings grown in the dark for 2 d were mixed with 25 μL magnetic particles in immunoprecipitation buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 0.5 mM EDTA, and 0. 5% Nonidet P-40) and incubated overnight at 4°C. After washing three times with cold buffer [0.2 M (NH4)HCO3], the proteins were harvested for further analysis. HDAC assays were performed using the HDAC activity colorimetric assay kit (BioVision) following the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, 4 µg of purified proteins was diluted to 85 μL in each well of the 96-well plate, and 10 μL 10× HDAC assay buffer and 5 μL colorimetric substrate [10 mM Ac-Lys(Ac)-pNA] were added to each well and incubated at 37°C for 1 h. The reaction was stopped by adding 10 μL Lys developer and incubating the plate at 37°C for 30 min. The HDAC activity was then measured by spectrophotometer at 405 nm. HeLa nuclear extracts (4 µg) were used as the positive control. The HDAC inhibitor TSA was also used to demonstrate the specificity of deacetylation activities.
