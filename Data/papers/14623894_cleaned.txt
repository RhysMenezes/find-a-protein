!~ABS~! Calcitonins are 32-amino acid peptide hormones with both peripheral and central actions mediated via specific cell surface receptors, which belong to the class II subfamily of G protein-coupled receptors. Understanding receptor function, particularly in terms of ligand recognition by calcitonin receptors, may aid in the rational design of calcitonin analogs with increased potency and improved selectivity. To directly identify sites of proximity between calcitonin and its receptor, we carried out photoaffinity labeling studies followed by protein digestion and mapping of the radiolabeled photoconjugated receptor. A fully active salmon calcitonin analog [Arg11,18,Bpa19]sCT, incorporating a photolabile p-benzoyl-l-phenylalanine into position 19 of the ligand, has been used to demonstrate spatial proximity between residue 19 of the peptide and the amino-terminal extracellular domain of the receptor. Cyanogen bromide cleavage together with endoproteinase Asp-N digestion indicated that binding was predominantly to the region delimited by receptor residues Cys134 and Met187. Binding to this fragment was supported further by cyanogen bromide-digestion of receptors that were mutated to remove the predicted cleavage site at Met133 (M133A, M133L). Binding within the 54-amino acid fragment was refined further by digestion with endoproteinase Lys-C to the 8-amino acid region corresponding to Cys134–Lys141. These results provide the first direct demonstration of a contact domain between salmon calcitonin and its receptor and will contribute toward modeling of the calcitonin-receptor interface. 
!~RES~! Pharmacological Characterization of [Bpa19]sCT—A photoactive analog of sCT, substituted with Bpa at position 19 [Bpa19]sCT was synthesized as a photoaffinity probe of the CTR. Evaluation of the interaction of this analog with the HA-hCTRa transiently transfected into COS-7 cells revealed similar affinity ([Bpa19]sCT, IC50 = 2.94 ± 0.46 nm versus sCT, IC50 = 2.07 ± 0.32 nm, n = 3) and efficacy (EC50 = 33.79 ± 16.81 pm versus 8.21 ± 3.84 pm, respectively, n = 3) to native sCT (Fig. 1, A and B). [125I-Bpa19]sCT also displayed similar affinity to the unlabeled peptide (IC50 = 3.56 ± 0.75 nm for sCT and 3.21 ± 0.34 nm for [Bpa19]sCT, n = 3, Fig. 1C). Therefore, this analog was suitable for photoaffinity labeling of the receptor and assessment of sites of proximity between residue 19 of the peptide and the receptor.  [[FIGURE]]  Photoaffinity Cross-linking of hCTRa with [125I-Bpa19]sCT— Cross-linking of [125I-Bpa19]sCT to intact COS-7 cells transiently expressing the HA-hCTRa revealed a single radiolabeled band of Mr ∼72,000, and this band was shifted to Mr ∼51,000 after treatment of the ligand-receptor complex with Endo-F to remove N-linked carbohydrate on the receptor NH2 terminus (Fig. 2). These bands are receptor-specific because they were not observed in the nontransfected cells and were completely inhibited by coincubation with excess unlabeled sCT (10-7 m) (Fig. 2). The receptor mass and level of glycosylation are consistent with the expected mass of the receptor and previously characterized level of receptor glycosylation (CITATION). The cross-linked receptor-[125I-Bpa19]sCT conjugate was then subjected to a series of chemical and enzymatic cleavages to identify the site of covalent contact between the ligand and receptor.  [[FIGURE]]  The photolabeled HA-hCTRa was digested with CNBr, which cleaves at the COOH terminus of methionine residues, followed by resolution on an SDS-Tricine gel and autoradiography. One specifically labeled band of Mr ∼9,300 was identified. Sequential digestion with Endo-F followed by CNBr did not alter the mobility of the Mr 9,000 fragment (Fig. 3). Possible candidate receptor fragments for this band included Lys23–Met48 (Mr ∼4,800 including the HA tag), Cys134–Met187 (Mr ∼6,000), Ile197–Met229 (Mr ∼4,000), Ala307–Met327 (Mr ∼2,500), and Ile347–Met367 (Mr ∼2,500) (Fig. 4), given the molecular mass of the radiolabeled ligand (3.8 kDa).  [[FIGURE]]  [[FIGURE]]  Immunoprecipitation of the [125I-Bpa19]sCT·HA-hCTRa complex after cleavage with CNBr did not precipitate a radioactive band, indicating that the far NH2-terminal end of the receptor was not a site of cross-linking (data not shown). Mutation of Met346 or Met367 to leucine, which did not alter either sCT binding or cell surface expression of the receptor, did not shift the migration of the lower molecular mass band, indicating that cross-linking did not occur within extracellular loop 3. However, mutation of Met133 to either leucine or alanine completely abolished the generation of the Mr 9,300 band, with a higher prominent radiolabeled fragment of Mr 20,000 formed following sequential digestion with Endo-F and CNBr (Fig. 5). This band, which was consistent with digestion around the Met133 site in the wild-type receptor, was equivalent in size to the two accumulated fragments, Gln60–Met133 (8.8 kDa) and Cys134–Met187 (6.1 kDa) (Fig. 4). In some experiments of the wild-type hCTR, digestion with CNBr was incomplete with weak bands of Mr 20,000 and Mr 40,000 (Endo-F-treated and untreated, respectively) seen in addition to the predominant band of Mr 9,300. These data suggested incomplete digestion around Met133 in these experiments and was consistent with data from L90M, V108M, and V117M mutants, which demonstrated progressive decreases in molecular mass of the incomplete digestion products (data not shown). Thus, [125IBpa19]sCT cross-links to a single CNBr-derived domain that is delimited by Cys134 and Met187.  [[FIGURE]]  To define and confirm further the binding domain of the [125I-Bpa19]sCT, the intact photolabeled HA-hCTRa was incubated with the enzyme Asp-N, which digests specifically at the NH2-terminal side of aspartic acid residues. Asp-N cleavage yielded two radiolabeled bands after resolution on SDS-Tricine gel: an Mr ∼26,000 fragment in addition to a higher molecular mass band presumably resulting from incomplete digestion. When treated with Endo-F, the electrophoretic mobility of the Mr 26,000 band shifted to Mr ∼12,000, demonstrating that it is glycosylated (Fig. 6). Only two Asp-N-generated domains on hCTRa contain glycosylation sites (Fig. 7). One comprises Asp57–Trp76 (Mr ∼2,400) and is too small compared with the band size. The other region, Asp113–Arg214 is Mr ∼12,000. The predicted mass for this fragment plus [125I-Bpa19]sCT (Mr ∼16,000) is close to the observed electrophoretic mobility of the smallest fragment. Furthermore, this receptor segment is consistent with that identified from analysis of CNBr cleavage, supporting cross-linking of [125I-Bpa19]sCT to within Cys134 and Met187 of the receptor.  [[FIGURE]]  [[FIGURE]]  Additional refinement of the interacting site was achieved via digestion of the ligand-receptor complex with the endoproteinase Lys-C, which cleaves at the COOH terminus of lysine residues. Digestion of the [125I-Bpa19]sCT·HA-hCTRa complex with Endo-Lys-C yielded an Mr ∼20,000 fragment in addition to a higher molecular mass band resulting from incomplete digestion (Fig. 8). When treated with Endo-F, the electrophoretic mobility of the Mr 20,000 band shifted to Mr ∼8,000 (Mr ∼4,000 after subtracting the 3.8 kDa probe), demonstrating that it is glycosylated. Only two Endo-Lys-C-generated domains on HA-hCTRa contain glycosylation sites: Cys55–Lys107 (Mr ∼5,900), which contains one glycosylation site, and His121–Lys141 (Mr ∼2,300), which contains two glycosylation sites (Fig. 9), suggesting that the latter fragment is the probable site of cross-linking.  [[FIGURE]]  [[FIGURE]]  Taken together with the CNBr data, the results indicate that [Bpa19]sCT cross-links specifically to a site contained within the small receptor region delimited by residues Cys134 and Lys141 of hCTRa.  In an attempt to identify individual receptor amino acids involved in the cross-linking, this small region of the receptor was subjected to alanine scanning mutagenesis. Wild-type and mutant receptors were transiently transfected into COS-7 cells and assessed for cell surface expression, binding affinity, and functional response. With one exception, all mutants were fully expressed at the cell surface and displayed equivalent affinity for sCT in 125I-sCT competition binding studies (Table I). Likewise, there was little change in either EC50 (Table I) or Emax values (not shown) for sCT-mediated accumulation of cAMP. The exception to this was the C134A mutant, which was very poorly expressed at the cell surface and essentially did not bind or respond to sCT. Cysteine 134 is one of 6 highly conserved cysteine residues in the NH2 terminus of class II G protein-coupled receptors. Studies with other class II receptors have demonstrated that each of these cysteines forms a disulfide bond that is believed to maintain the topology required for ligand binding and for the receptor to be properly folded and expressed at the cell surface (CITATION, CITATION, CITATION). Thus, lack of functionality of this mutant is not surprising. The data with the other mutants (N135A, A136V, F137A, T138A, P139A, E140A and K141A) demonstrate that conversion to alanine did not functionally affect ligand-receptor interaction. Photoaffinity cross-linking of [125I-Bpa19] sCT to each of the mutated receptors transiently expressed into COS-7 cells gave rise to a band of Mr ∼75,000 (Fig. 10A), and subsequent digestion with CNBr resulted in a predominant band of Mr 9,300 (Fig. 10B). These radiolabeled fragments were not markedly different from the wild-type receptor, indicating that substitution of individual amino acids with alanine was not sufficient to alter the efficiency of cross-linking.

Sequencing grade endoproteinases Lys-C and Asp-N, N-glycosidase F, and protease inhibitor mixture tablets were obtained from Roche Applied Science. Salmon CT and all amino acid derivatives were synthesized by Auspep (Parkville, Australia). Na125I(specific activity of 2,200 Ci/mmol) was from Amersham Biosciences. 125I-Goat anti-mouse immunoglobulin G antibody (specific activity 1,035 Ci/mmol) was obtained from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Bovine serum albumin (BSA) was from ICN (Costa Mesa, CA). Penicillin G/streptomycin was from Multicell Technologies (Warwick, RI). Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, fetal bovine serum, HEPES, Fungizone, and trypsin together with LipofectAMINE reagents and protein molecular mass markers were from Invitrogen. Tissue culture disposables and plasticware were purchased from Falcon (Bedford, MA). 12CA5 mouse monoclonal antibody directed against the hemagglutinin (HA) epitope was purified from hybridoma cells via a Hi-Trap protein G column (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions.  Lysine residues at positions 11 and 18 in the native sCT sequence were replaced with arginines to render the ligand resistant to enzymatic cleavage by endoproteinase Lys-C; this substitution does not alter activity of the peptide (CITATION). In general, the procedure for analog synthesis was as follows.  Solid Phase Peptide Synthesis—A 0.2-mmol scale was used with the continuous flow Fmoc-polyamide method and a MilliGen 9050 automated synthesizer as described previously (CITATION). Fmoc-PAL-PEG-PS resin was used as the solid support to generate a COOH-terminal peptide-amide. Amino acid side chain protection was afforded by tert-butyl esters and ethers for Glu, Ser, Thr, and Tyr, trityl for Asn, Gln, His, and Cys, and 2,2,4,6,7-pentamethyldihydrobenzofuran-5-sulfonyl for Arg. Residue 19 was introduced manually via its Fmoc-p-benzoylphenyalanine derivative. All amino acid derivatives were activated in situ with 2-(1H-benzotrazole-1-yl)-1,1,3,3-tetramethylronium hexafluorophosphate/N,N′-diisoethylpropylamine in dimethyl formamide. Each acylation was of 30-min duration, and subsequent Nα-Fmoc deprotection was with 20% piperidine in dimethyl formamide. After synthesis, the peptide was separately cleaved and deprotected by a 3-h treatment with 95% trifluoroacetic acid, 3% anisole, 1% triethylsilane, 1% phenol (v/v/v/w) at room temperature. The crude cleaved peptide was precipitated from ice-cold ether and freeze dried.  Folding and Oxidation—The crude S-reduced peptide was treated with 20% aqueous dimethyl sulfoxide in 5% aqueous acetic acid (CITATION). Oxidation was monitored by analytical reversed phase high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) on a Vydac C18 column (Hesperia) using a gradient of CH3CN in 0.1% aqueous trifluoroacetic acid for 21 h. The reaction was stopped by further acidification with neat trifluoroacetic acid. Peptide purification was by preparative reversed phase HPLC with a Vydac C18 column.  Characterization—Peptide purity was confirmed by analytical reversed phase HPLC and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry using a Bruker Biflex instrument (Bremen, Germany) in the linear mode at 19.5 kV. For peptide 1–32, calculated: MH+ 3,627.0; found: 3,628.2. Peptide quantitation was by amino acid analysis of a 24-h acid hydrolysate.  Radiolabeled sCT and [Bpa19]sCT (specific activity ∼700 Ci/mmol) were prepared by the chloramine-T method as described previously (CITATION). The iodinated peptides were purified using silica QUSO G32 (North America Silica Co.), washed twice with H2O, and eluted with 20% acetone and 1% acetic acid.  cDNA of the hCTRa isoform was excised from the pZEM228cc expression vector (CITATION) using the restriction enzymes HindIII and BamHI and subcloned into the multicloning site of the mammalian expression vector pcDNA3.1zeo+ (Invitrogen). The receptor was mutated to introduce a unique AgeI restriction site at amino acid 23, immediately following the predicted signal peptide cleavage site, using site-directed mutagenesis (QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit; Stratagene). To create NH2-terminal double epitope tags, complementary oligonucleotides that contained two HA epitope peptide sequences flanked by AgeI restriction sites, 5′-GCTGCTGCACCGGTCCCATATGATGTACCAGATTATGCACCAT ATGATGTACCAGATTATGCCACCGGTGCTGCTGCT-3′ and 5′-AGCAGCAGCACC GGTGGCATAATCTGGTACATCATATGGTGCATAATCTGGTACATCATATGGGACCGGTGCAGCAGC-3′, were annealed by heating at 95 °C, then gradually cooled and digested with AgeI restriction enzyme. The AgeI-digested double-stranded oligonucleotides were purified and ligated into AgeI-digested, mutated pCDNA3.1zeo+:hCTRa to generate the “wild-type HA-hCTRa” construct. At each step, the sequence integrity of the constructs was verified using PCR dideoxynucleotide chain termination sequencing.  The following point mutations were introduced, by QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis, into wild-type HA-hCTRa: L90M, V108M, V117M, M133A, M133L, C134A, N135A, A136V, F137A, T138A, P139A, E140A, K141A, M346L, and M367L. Selected clones were chosen for plasmid isolation (Qiagen; La Jolla, CA), and the presence of mutations was confirmed by nucleotide sequencing (Australian Genome Research Facility, Parkville, Australia).  COS-7 cells were routinely cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 5% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin, HEPES, and Fungizone at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 95% air and 5% CO2. For radioligand receptor binding assay and analysis of cell surface receptor expression, COS-7 cells were seeded into 24-well plates. For cross-linking studies, COS-7 cells were grown in 6-well plates for small scale, and in 60-cm2 dishes or 140-cm2 dishes for large scale experiments. Once the cell monolayers were at 95% confluence, cells were transfected with LipofectAMINE using 100 ng, 500 ng, 3 μg, and 7 μg of plasmid DNA in 24-well plates, 6-well plates, 60-cm2 and 140-cm2 dishes, respectively according to the manufacturer's protocol. All transient transfections were performed with either wild-type or mutant HA-hCTRa.  Transiently transfected COS-7 cells were grown to confluence in 24-well plates. The cells were incubated with either ∼90 pm 125I-sCT or [125I-Bpa19]sCT in binding buffer (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 0.1% BSA) in the absence (total binding) or presence of varying concentrations of unlabeled peptides. Cells were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C and subsequently washed with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed with 1 m NaOH. The entire cell lysate was counted in a PerkinElmer Life Sciences γ-irradiation counter to determine the bound radioactivity.  Intracellular cAMP assay was performed in 384-well plates using the Alpha Screen cAMP kit (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). In brief, transiently transfected COS-7 cells in 60-cm2 dishes were harvested, counted, and resuspended into stimulation buffer (phenol red free medium, 0.1% BSA, 1 mm 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine) and preincubated at 37 °C for ∼20 min. Cells (10,000 cells/well) were then incubated at 37 °C for 30 min in the absence and presence of increasing concentration of agonists, either sCT or [Bpa19]sCT. After incubation, anti-cAMP acceptor beads that were prepared in lysis buffer (5 mm HEPES, 0.3% Tween 20, 0.1% BSA) were added to all wells and incubated at room temperature for 30 min in the dark. The detection mix of biotinylated cAMP/streptavidin donor beads, which was preincubated in the dark for 30 min at room temperature, was then added to all wells. The assay plate was incubated overnight at room temperature before reading on a Fusion plate reader (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). For each experiment, forskolin and cAMP dose-response curves were performed in parallel to allow translation of the α-screen signal to either cAMP or a percent of the maximum forskolin response.  COS-7 cells transiently expressing wild-type or mutated receptors were incubated for 1 h in darkness with binding buffer (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 0.1% BSA) containing ∼900 pm [125IBpa19]sCT/well in the presence (nonspecific binding) or absence (total binding) of 10-7 m [Bpa19]sCT. Cells were washed twice with cold 1 × phosphate-buffered saline to remove unbound ligand and then irradiated at a distance of ∼ 5 cm with a 365-nm UV lamp on ice for 30 min. Lysis buffer (0.1 m Tris, 10 mm EDTA, pH 7.3) was then added, and the cells were scraped free of the culture plates and centrifuged at 1,800 × g for 10 min.  To remove potential contamination of signal arising from carry forward of noncovalently bound radioligand, cell lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation according to the method of Sengstag et al. (CITATION). For this, 2 μg of anti-HA antibody was incubated with each sample to precipitate the [125I-Bpa19]sCT·HA-hCTRa complex, with complexes subsequently isolated using protein G-Sepharose beads. For samples not subjected to enzymatic or chemical cleavage, the complexes were eluted directly from the beads using 1 × “reduced” SDS-sample buffer and the eluted proteins were immediately electrophoresed on 10% SDS-PAGE.  When necessary, the samples were reduced with 0.5% SDS, 100 mm dithiothreitol, followed by alkylation with 100 mm iodoacetamide for 25 min at room temperature in the dark to break the disulfide bonds irreversibly.  After immunoprecipitation, the ligand-receptor conjugates were subjected to enzymatic or chemical cleavage. For Endo-F deglycosylation, the bead samples were resuspended in 0.15 m Tris, pH 8.8, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% SDS, 0.1% β-mercaptoethanol containing 1 unit of N-glycosidase F. For endoproteinase Asp-N digestion, samples were incubated in 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 8.0, 0.1% SDS, containing 0.04 μg/μl Asp-N enzyme. For endoproteinase Lys-C digestion, samples were resuspended in 0.1 m Tris, pH 8.5, containing 0.1 μg/μl Lys-C enzyme. All enzyme-treated samples were incubated at 37 °C for 18 h. For CNBr cleavage, samples were incubated in 100 μl of 70% trifluoroacetic acid with 10 mg/ml CNBr for 24 h at room temperature, in darkness and under nitrogen. After the incubation period, samples were diluted 5-fold with H2O and dried using a vacuum concentrator. Samples were then redissolved in 500 μl of H2O and dried again.  Radiolabeled samples were assessed using a combination of 10% SDS-PAGE and 16.5% SDS-Tricine or 10–20% SDS-Tricine (for low molecular mass proteins). After electrophoresis, gels were stained with Coomassie Blue R-250, destained, dried, and exposed to phosphorimaging screens (Fuji-Bas; Tokyo, Japan) for 1–5 days to identify radiolabeled fragments. The relative molecular mass (Mr) of the radiolabeled band was determined, by interpolation, on a plot of the mobility of protein standards versus the log values of their apparent molecular mass.  Independent monitoring of the cell surface expression of wild-type and mutated HA-hCTRa, in intact COS-7 cells, was performed using the 12CA5 anti-HA antibody as described (CITATION), with minor modifications. Transfected COS-7 cells were rinsed twice with binding buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.7, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 1% BSA); cells were then incubated for 3 h at 4 °C with binding buffer alone, for nonspecific binding, and binding buffer containing HA-antibody (4 μg/well in 24-well plates) for total binding. Cells were rinsed twice and incubated further with 125I-goat anti-mouse immunoglobulin G antibody for 3 h at 4 °C. Cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and then lysed with 1 m NaOH. The whole cell lysate was counted in a PerkinElmer Life Sciences γ-irradiation counter to determine the bound radioactivity. The specific binding of antibody to each mutant was calculated by subtracting the nonspecifically bound radioactivity from total binding.  All experiments were repeated independently at least three times, unless otherwise indicated. The binding curves and cAMP dose-response data are expressed as the mean ± S.D. Data were analyzed using nonlinear regression with the Prism Software package (Graph-Pad Software, Inc., San Diego). Values in the tables are presented as mean ± S.E., unless otherwise indicated.
