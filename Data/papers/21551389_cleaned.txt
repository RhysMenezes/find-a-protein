!~ABS~! The Arabidopsis thaliana MAP65-1 and MAP65-2 genes are members of the larger eukaryotic MAP65/ASE1/PRC gene family of microtubule-associated proteins. We created fluorescent protein fusions driven by native promoters that colocalized MAP65-1 and MAP65-2 to a subset of interphase microtubule bundles in all epidermal hypocotyl cells. MAP65-1 and MAP65-2 labeling was highly dynamic within microtubule bundles, showing episodes of linear extension and retraction coincident with microtubule growth and shortening. Dynamic colocalization of MAP65-1/2 with polymerizing microtubules provides in vivo evidence that plant cortical microtubules bundle through a microtubule-microtubule templating mechanism. Analysis of etiolated hypocotyl length in map65-1 and map65-2 mutants revealed a critical role for MAP65-2 in modulating axial cell growth. Double map65-1 map65-2 mutants showed significant growth retardation with no obvious cell swelling, twisting, or morphological defects. Surprisingly, interphase microtubules formed coaligned arrays transverse to the plant growth axis in dark-grown and GA4-treated light-grown map65-1 map65-2 mutant plants. We conclude that MAP65-1 and MAP65-2 play a critical role in the microtubule-dependent mechanism for specifying axial cell growth in the expanding hypocotyl, independent of any mechanical role in microtubule array organization.
!~RES~! We obtained Arabidopsis lines with tDNA insertions in the MAP65-1 and MAP65-2 genes from publically available seed collections. We confirmed multiple alleles for both genes by DNA sequencing. SALK_006083.45.75 (map65-1-1) and SALK_118225.51.80 (map65-1-2) contain tDNA insertions in the fifth exon of MAP65-1 94 and 132 nucleotides from the left exon border, respectively, and upstream of the MT binding site (Figure 1A). We obtained three tDNA insertion lines for MAP65-2 and identified their insertion sites as SALK_061943.49.20 (map65-2-1) 19 nucleotides into the reported 5′ untranslated region (UTR), and SAIL_1214_G02 (map65-2-2) and SAIL_378_A01 (map65-2-3), both positioned within 25 nucleotides upstream of the 5′ UTR. The relative amounts of MAP65-1 and MAP65-2 mRNA present in the tDNA alleles were measured using quantitative RT-PCR (qPCR). Both map65-1 alleles produced significantly less full-length MAP65-1 mRNA than wild-type seedlings (Figure 1B). The amount of MAP65-2 mRNA was not significantly reduced in the map65-2-1 allele and appeared to be increased in the map65-2-2 and map65-2-3 alleles. Immunoblots performed using antibodies raised against MAP65-1 that show cross-reactivity to MAP65-2 (CITATION, CITATION) revealed markedly lower MAP65-1/2 protein levels in map65-1-1 and map65-1-2 and a slight reduction in map65-2-1 (Figure 1C; see Supplemental Figure 1 online). MAP65-1/2 protein levels do not appear markedly different for the map65-2-2 and map65-2-3 alleles. The double map65-1-1 map65-2-2 mutant shows a substantial reduction in total MAP65-1/2 protein level despite the apparent increase in MAP65-2 mRNA for the map65-2-2 allele. We created an artificial microRNA (CITATION) to the 3′ UTR of MAP65-2 (amiRNA65-2) and placed it under a dexamethasone (dex)–inducible promoter (CITATION). We transformed the amiRNA65-2 into the map65-1-2 mutant background to create a synthetic double mutant. Single amiRNA65-2 lines are not reported owing to the possibility of secondary targeting of MAP65-1 mRNA due to the high sequence similarity between the two genes. We observed that continuous dex treatment produces a >50% knockdown in MAP65-2 mRNA for 5-d-old seedlings compared with solvent-treated controls (Figure 1B). Dex treatment had no apparent effect on MAP65 protein levels in control plants, and the synthetic double mutant had reduced levels of MAP65-1/2 protein as indicated by immunoblots (Figure 1C). We investigated the role of MAP65-1 and MAP65-2 in axial cell growth by comparing hypocotyl length in mutant and wild-type seedlings (Figure 2A). Seedlings were grown at 22°C either on agar plates or in liquid culture for 10 d in complete darkness to evaluate maximum hypocotyl extension (CITATION). Neither of the homozygous map65-1 tDNA alleles showed a significant difference in hypocotyl length when compared with wild-type plants in this terminal growth assay (Figure 2B; see Supplemental Figure 2 online). The map65-2-1 tDNA allele showed a trend toward shorter (95% of the wild type) hypocotyl length. The map65-2-2 and map65-2-3 mutants reached only 80 and 85% of wild-type length, respectively, both significant (t test P < 0.0001) when compared with wild-type plants (Figure 2B). [[FIGURE]] To test for genetic interactions between MAP65-1 and MAP65-2, we crossed map65-2-2 and map65-1-1 alleles to create a homozygous double mutant line. Double map65-1-1 map65-2-2 mutant hypocotyls were significantly shorter than those measured in dark-grown wild-type plants (t test P < 0.0001), reaching only 60% of Columbia-0 (Col-0) length (Figure 2B). Hypocotyl length in the double mutant is also significantly shorter than hypocotyl length in the map65-2-2 allele (t test P < 0.0001), indicating a genetic interaction (Figure 2B). Light-grown hypocotyl length in the double map65-1-1 map65-2-2 mutant (see Supplemental Figure 2 online) was also significantly shorter than in wild-type plants (80% of the wild type, t test P < 0.0001). Continuous dex induction of amiRNA65-2 in the map65-1-2 background further reduced hypocotyl length to <25% of wild-type length after 10 d of growth (Figure 2C). Synthetic double mutant plants grown without dex treatment were not different in length from wild-type plants (Figure 2C). Dex treatment had no measurable effect on hypocotyl length in wild-type Col-0 or in plants expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP) from the same dex-inducible vector (see Supplemental Figure 3 online). To determine whether the hypocotyl phenotype was attributable to interphase growth or to defects in cell division, we counted the number of epidermal cells per file in map65-1-1 map65-2-2 double mutant hypocotyls. Cell number per file did not differ between wild-type and double mutant plants (wild type = 20.5 ± 5.0, n = 73 files; map65-1-1/map65-2-2 = 19.2 ± 4.3, n = 59 files). These data show that MAP65-2 is required for proper axial extension of the hypocotyl cells and that MAP65-1 plays a contributing role in the absence of MAP65-2. The general growth habit and size of map65 mutant alleles grown on agar plates for >16 d in continuous light did not differ substantively from wild-type plants except in the case of the synthetic double mutant grown on dex-supplemented media (see Supplemental Figure 4 online). We tested the causal relationship between the verified tDNA insertions and the hypocotyl growth phenotypes by creating transgenic plants expressing MAP65-1 or MAP65-2 as fluorescent protein fusions. We created N-terminal fluorescent protein fusions using genomic DNA sequences for both MAP65-1 and MAP65-2 driven by 2.6- and 2.1-kb fragments of genomic DNA cloned upstream of the respective genes. To evaluate fusion protein function, we transformed both fusion constructs into the map65-1-1 map65-2-2 double mutant and subjected the transgenic lines to hypocotyl elongation assays. The double tDNA mutant was used because single map65-1 alleles lack a phenotype and the single map65-2 alleles show a weak phenotype. Expression of GFP:MAP65-1 in the double mutant (four independent lines) restored etiolated hypocotyl elongation from 60 to 85% of wild-type length (Figure 2D; see Supplemental Figure 2 online). This hypocotyl length is significantly shorter than that of wild-type plants (t test, P < 0.0001) and similar to that of the map65-2-2 single mutant allele. Expression of mCherry:MAP65-2 in the double mutant (four independent lines) produced hypocotyls that were slightly longer (t test, P < 0.0001) than those of wild-type plants (Figure 2D). We additionally coexpressed both GFP:MAP65-1 and mCherry:MAP65-2 constitutively from cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoters in wild-type plants and found no additional gain in hypocotyl length beyond that found with expression of the native promoter mCherry:MAP65-2 in the double mutant background (Figure 2D). Together, these data provide evidence that the mutant growth phenotype is due to the tDNA insertions in the respective MAP65-1 and MAP65-2 genes and indicate that the GFP:MAP65-1 and mCherry:MAP65-2 fusion proteins are functional in plants. Our terminal hypocotyl growth assays indicated that MAP65-2 is required for axial hypocotyl extension and that MAP65-1 may have an auxiliary role. To further probe the function of MAP65-1 and MAP65-2 in axial hypocotyl extension, we placed additional stress on plants and evaluated growth under these sensitized conditions. We grew wild-type and double tDNA map65-1-1 map65-2-2 mutant plants in a concentration series of the MT polymerization inhibitor oryzalin (Figure 3A) or the cellulose synthase inhibitor isoxoben (Figure 3B), both previously shown to exaggerate growth defects in plants with cytoskeletal defects (CITATION; CITATION). We observed that both drugs affect wild-type and mutant plants starting at the same drug concentrations and have proportionally similar effects on hypocotyl length across all drug concentrations. We found no evidence for supersensitivity to either drug. [[FIGURE]] Plant growth rate and cytoskeletal dynamics are both influenced by ambient temperature (CITATION; CITATION), and in vitro studies have suggested that MAP65-1 can stabilize MTs against depolymerization at low temperatures (CITATION; CITATION). To determine if MAP65-1 or MAP65-2 are attuned to modulating growth at a specific temperature range, we grew wild-type, map65-1-1, and map65-2-2 mutant plants at normal (22°C), cold (16°C), and warm (30°C) temperatures for 10 d in the dark and compared hypocotyl lengths. We observed that growth at different temperatures does not change the proportional growth of the wild-type and mutant plants under these conditions (Figure 3C). Our terminal growth assays indicated that these map65-1 and map65-2 mutant alleles do not show a supersensitivity phenotype to temperature. Gibberellic acid (GA4) increases the rate of hypocotyl growth in Arabidopsis seedlings (CITATION; CITATION) and has been shown to bias cortical MT orientation toward transverse coalignment (CITATION). We assayed dark-grown wild-type and double tDNA map65-1-1 map65-2-2 mutant seedlings for hypocotyl growth effects across a range of GA4 concentrations (Figure 3D). We observed that 10 d of GA4 treatment increases the terminal length of both wild-type and mutant hypocotyls. Wild-type plants reached maximum lengths that were 10% longer than untreated plants, while mutant hypocotyls increased from 60% of the length of untreated wild-type hypocotyls to 80% (Figure 3D). These data indicated that the mutant growth phenotype is not exaggerated by the stress of GA4 addition, that the mutant has the capacity for further hypocotyl elongation, and that GA4 does not fully rescue the hypocotyl growth defect. Mutations in MAPs and application of MT-specific small molecule inhibitors often lead to defects in cellular morphogenesis (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION). To visualize the hypocotyl surface in live plants without chemical fixation or dehydration, we stained cell walls with propidium iodide and imaged the cells using confocal laser scanning microscopy. We created surface projections from each axial image series using software (see Methods). Seedlings were imaged at 4 d postgermination to show the details of wild-type and mutant cells on a comparable scale. Hypocotyl cells in the single and double map65-1 map65-2 tDNA mutants formed distinct cell files in dark-grown seedlings and showed no obvious swelling or cellular deformation (Figures 4A to 4D). We observed no twisting or rotation of hypocotyls in the etiolated tDNA mutant alleles or the dex-induced synthetic double mutant (Figures 4A to 4E). The epidermal cells are shorter than wild-type cells as evidenced by the position of the cross walls. Due to the severe growth retardation, we compared cell morphology of the dex-induced synthetic double mutant (Figure 4E) to younger (2 d postgermination) wild-type plants having a similar epidermal cell size (Figure 4F). We observe that the 10-d-old synthetic double mutant has a subtle qualitative difference in cell shape but no obvious morphological defects, suggesting that cell growth is arrested rather than aberrant. [[FIGURE]] We additionally compared our synthetic double mutant to etiolated wild-type plants that were continuously treated with 5 μm oryzalin (Figure 4G). The oryzalin-treated wild-type plants reach about the same hypocotyl length as our synthetic double mutant (Figure 2A) but contain highly distorted epidermal cells that are larger than those in the dex-treated synthetic double mutant (Figures 4E and 4G). Continuous oryzalin treatment of the dex-induced synthetic double mutant produced epidermal cells with the same obvious cell swelling observed for wild-type plants, with cells that were visibly much larger than cells in the map65 mutant not treated with oryzalin (Figures 4E and 4H). These data show that the map65 mutant has not lost the capacity for cell growth per se and that MTs are required for the retardation of growth observed in these map65 mutants. Together, these experiments indicate that the principal observed defect in map65 mutant plants is a MT-dependent growth arrest and not a defect in creating the correct cell shape. To determine the spatiotemporal expression of MAP65-1 and MAP65-2 during hypocotyl growth, we transformed the native promoter GFP:MAP65-1 (four lines) and GFP:MAP65-2 (four lines) constructs into map65-1-2 and map65-2-1 alleles, respectively, yielding genomic fusion protein expression from the native promoters in the appropriate mutant backgrounds (GFP:MAP65-1 and GFP:MAP65-2). Using these lines as translational gene expression reporters, we evaluated the pattern of GFP:MAP65-1 and GFP:MAP65-2 accumulation in living seedlings using confocal laser scanning microscopy (Figures 5A and 5B). Consistent with the growth phenotypes, both GFP:MAP65-1 and GFP:MAP65-2 were visible in all epidermal hypocotyl cells at all examined times from germination to 10 d postgermination. Localization was observed in both light- and dark-grown seedlings with no marked expression gradients or obvious cell-specific differences. We find that GFP:MAP65-1 and GFP:MAP65-2 show completely overlapping expression patterns in the hypocotyl epidermis. The absence of GFP:MAP65-1 and GFP:MAP65-2 expression in the upper portions of the root demonstrates tissue-specific control of MAP65:1 and MAP65-2 accumulation during seedling development (Figures 5A and 5B). [[FIGURE]] We examined the intracellular localization of GFP:MAP65-1 and GFP:MAP65-2 in their respective mutant backgrounds using confocal laser scanning microscopy (Figure 5). We observed linear structures, presumed to be MT bundles, organized into transverse, oblique, longitudinal, and less organized array patterns in cells from light-grown plants (Figures 5C to 5H). Using genomic promoters, we found no evidence for hyperbundling of arrays (CITATION, CITATION) and no obvious preference for transverse array orientation to the growth axis of the cell in these light-grown plants (CITATION). To determine whether MAP65-1 and MAP65-2 labeled different structures in the same cell, we created transgenic plants that coexpress GFP:MAP65-1 and mCherry:Map65-2 under native promoters in the double mutant background (Figures 5I to 5Q). We created emission bandwidths with the microscope spectral detector to eliminate crosstalk between GFP and mCherry signal and verified channel spatial alignment with double-labeled fluorescent particles prior to imaging. Observations on three independently derived transgenic lines revealed complete colocalization of MAP65-1 and MAP65-2 in all epidermal hypocotyl cells and in all MT array organizations (Figures 5I to 5K). We observed MAP65-1 and MAP65-2 reporters on all cell faces using reconstructions of serial optical sections from light-grown epidermal cells. The anticlinal side and end faces were labeled with MAP65-1 and MAP65-2 (Figures 5L to 5Q). Localization was continuous from periclinal (surface) to anticlinal (side) structures in many cases where the density of labeling allowed for unambiguous tracing of the filaments (Figures 5L to 5N). One critical exception to the observation that MAP65-1 and MAP65-2 are present on all cell faces is found in young light-grown seedlings. Hypocotyl cells at 2 to 3 d postgermination displayed transversely coaligned arrays of MAP65-1 and MAP65-2 on the surface and anticlinal side faces of the cell (Figure 6A). In these cases, we observe that MAP65-1 and MAP65-2 are absent at the apical and basal anticlinal end faces (Figure 6B). When viewed along the plant growth axis, reconstructions of these epidermal cells show no observable MAP65-1/2 labeling at the interface between sequential cells in the cell file. [[FIGURE]] To covisualize MAP65 with MTs, we created double transgenic plant lines expressing either mCherry:MAP65-1 or mCherry:MAP65-2 and a constitutively expressed GFP-α-tubulin-6 transgene (GFP:TUA6). We found that mCherry:MAP65-1 and mCherry:MAP65-2, when expressed from native promoters and in their respective tDNA mutant backgrounds, localized exclusively to MTs (Figures 7A to 7C) throughout the cortical array, including the anticlinal side and end (insets in Figures 7A to 7C) faces of cells. We observed that not all MTs were MAP65 labeled (arrows in Figures 7A to 7C). Unbundled MTs, identified by their dynamic exposed free ends, exhibited barely detectable levels of mCherry:MAP65-1 or mCherry:MAP65-2 (Figures 7A to 7C). We also observed regions of GFP:TUA6 having higher relative brightness than unbundled MTs that were not labeled with MAP65-1 or MAP65-2 (Figures 7A to 7C). These unlabeled regions often appeared as gaps within a linear trace of MAP65-1 or MAP65-2 labeling. [[FIGURE]] Consistent with in vitro observations (CITATION), we observed mCherry:MAP65-1 and mCherry:MAP65-2 localized to regions of antiparallel MT overlap in vivo (Figures 7E to 7G). The antiparallel structure of the MT bundle was inferred from time-lapse observation of two unbundled MTs polymerizing toward each other to form the bundle (Figures 7D and 7F). We observed the MAP65 labeling to coincide spatially and temporally with the polymerizing end of the bundling MT (Figures 7D to 7F; see Supplemental Movie 1 online). While we found no direct evidence for MAP65-1 or MAP65-2 labeling of parallel MT bundles, the complexity of the labeling patterns precluded our strictly ruling out this possibility (CITATION) or the possibility that some antiparallel MT overlaps remain unlabeled. We conclude from our observations that MAP65-1 and MAP65-2 label a subset of cortical array MT bundles, a major portion of which are antiparallel MTs. MAP65 orthologs in mammalian and fungal systems work with other MAPs to modify the dynamic properties of bundled MTs (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION; CITATION). To examine the dynamic properties of the MAP65-labeled regions, we made time-lapse observations of the GFP:MAP65-1 and GFP:MAP65-2 expressing lines. The MAP65 labeling exhibited episodes of extension and retraction in time-lapse movies (Figures 7H to 7N; see Supplemental Movie 2 online). Kymographs made from linear traces of MAP65 labeling in time-lapse experiments (Figures 7H and 7I) show phases of extension (e), fast retraction (fr), and slow retraction (sr) consistent with previously defined phases of MT plus end growth, plus end shortening, and the slower minus end shortening associated with MT treadmilling, respectively. We additionally observed apparent transitions between phases (Figure 7H, e to fr) and evidence for paused (p) GFP:MAP65-1 label (Figure 7I) that could arise due to a paused MT end, intrabundle nucleation, or a junction site where a treadmilling MT has initiated a bundle. Consistent with the time-lapse colocalization data for mCherry:MAP65-1 and GFP:TUA6 (Figures 7E to 7G), we found that the velocity of MT growth, measured from unbundled MTs (5.5 μm/min ± 1.35, n = 37 MTs), was equivalent to the rate of MAP65 label extension (5.1 μm/min ± 1.1, n = 53 events). Rates for fast retraction (17.2 μm/min ± 7.7, n = 35 events) and slow retraction (1.8 μm/min ± 0.17, n = 32 events) were also found to be equivalent to rates of plus end depolymerization (18.9 μm/min ± 7.2, n = 23 MTs) and minus end depolymerization (1.8 μm/min ± 0.6, n = 16 MTs) in these light-grown cells. Therefore, MAP65 does not appear to alter the growth or shortening velocities of MTs within bundles, and we find that antiparallel-bundled MTs appear to create and remove MAP65 binding sites coincident with polymerization and depolymerization, respectively. Intrabundle catastrophe and rescue (CITATION) were not measured using the MAP65 probes because we cannot unambiguously discriminate between these events and MTs that are entering or leaving sites of antiparallel overlap within a bundle. We commonly observed kymographs that had triangular shapes, consistent with MTs polymerizing in opposite directions to create antiparallel MT overlaps (Figure 7J). We also observed MAP65-labeled structures that had multiple and overlapping extension and retraction events within the related kymographs (Figure 7K), consistent with the presence of multiple dynamic MTs within the bundle. To determine how much of the MAP65-labeled portion of the MT array is dynamic, we compared maximum and minimum intensity projections from our time-lapse image data (Figures 7L to 7N; see Supplemental Movie 2 online). The maximum intensity projections indicate the total extent of GFP:MAP65-1 labeling in the array over a 9-min period (Figure 7M). When compared with the first image in the time-lapse series (Figure 7L), the maximum intensity image shows longer linear structures that cover a large portion of the cell face. The minimum intensity projection (Figure 7N) shows that nearly all MAP65-labeled structures (Figure 7M) do not remain labeled with MAP65 over the entire 9-min period. Kymographs made from regions of the minimum intensity projection image with residual GFP:MAP65-1 label (e.g., dashed outline in Figures 7L to 7N corresponds to kymograph in Figure 7K) contained highly dynamic MAP65-1 labeling with evidence for overlapping extension and retraction events. These persistent MAP65-1–labeled regions appear to be dynamic sites where multiple overlapping MT bundles intersect rather than individual stabilized MT bundles. We find that the MAP65-labeled MT bundles in these cells (n = 10 movies of >9 min from light-grown seedlings, >10 kymographs per movie) are predominantly composed of dynamic MTs that create and remove MAP65 binding sites through intrabundle polymerization and depolymerization. Biochemical and structural studies show that MAP65 proteins form homodimers that associate into MT bundles (Li et al., 2007; CITATION; CITATION). Noting the extensive cellular colocalization and gene similarity shared between MAP65-1 and MAP65-2, we used fluorescence redistribution after photobleaching (FRAP) to assess the likelihood that MAP65-1 and MAP65-2 form heterodimers that bind to MT bundles. We reasoned that if a significant fraction of the proteins heterodimerize before insertion into the bundle, their recovery time after bleaching (i.e., the rate of replacement in the bundle) should be equivalent or overlapping. Using a confocal laser scanning microscope, we photobleached GFP:MAP65-1, GFP:MAP65-2, or mCherry:MAP65-2 in 3- to 5-μm regions of individual bundles in single- or double-labeled transgenic plants where the native protein level is diminished. MAP65 accumulation on unbundled MTs was too low in vivo for FRAP measurement, suggesting that MAP65 has a relatively rapid off rate when not bridging MTs. We determined a mean half-time of recovery (t1/2) of 7.1 ±2.5 s for GFP:MAP65-1 (n = 13) in bundles, consistent with prior measurements (CITATION). We find a t1/2 of 1.1 ± 0.5 s for mCherry:MAP65-2 (n = 12) in bundles, showing that MAP65-2 has a more transient interaction at bundle sites than MAP65-1. Our data are consistent with MAP65-1 and MAP65-2 forming homodimers that enter and leave bundles on different time scales (CITATION; CITATION). Axial growth of plant cells is strongly correlated with transversely coaligned organization of the cortical MT array (CITATION; CITATION). To assess cortical MT array organization in hypocotyl cells deficient for MAP65-1 and MAP65-2, we created plants expressing a GFP:TUA6 transgene in the amiRNA65-2 map65-1-1 synthetic double mutant. Since the 488-nm light used for GFP excitation signals transverse MT arrays to reorganize, we rapidly (<1 min) mounted and transferred dark-grown seedlings to the microscope for imaging. We observed that MT arrays in both the wild-type and dex-induced synthetic double mutant plants exhibit predominantly coaligned MT arrays oriented transversely or slightly oblique to the plant growth axis (Figures 8A and 8B). MT density, spacing, and relative orientation do not appear qualitatively different between wild-type and mutant arrays (n = 24 plants for each). [[FIGURE]] Observations of MT arrays in light-grown plants revealed no obvious differences in MT array organization when wild-type plants were compared with the dex-induced synthetic double mutant (Figures 8C and 8D). Consistent with prior observations of wild-type plants (CITATION), kymographs made from time-lapse images of GFP:TUA6 MTs (4-s interval, 3.5-min duration) in the wild type and synthetic double mutant indicate that the MTs show no obvious lateral movement on the cell cortex and do not slide apart in the absence of MAP65-1/2 (Figures 8C and 8D). We used FRAP on 10-μm circular regions of cells expressing GFP:TUA6 (CITATION) to determine if the global MT dynamic properties are changed in the synthetic double map65 mutant. Recovery times of 46.2 s for wild-type plants and 49.5 s in dex-treated synthetic double mutants (n = 22 cells from more than three plants for each; see Supplemental Figure 5 online) reveal no substantive difference in MT dynamic properties in MAP65-1/2–deficient plants. Fluorescence recovery, normalized for the bleaching that occurs during time-lapse imaging, reached >95% for both wild-type and mutant MT arrays, suggesting that most of the MTs turn over in both mutant and wild-type plants in the 5-min duration of the experiment. To functionally test the ability of the amiRNA65-2 map65-1-1 synthetic double mutants to form transverse and coaligned MT arrays, we treated 4-d-old light-grown seedlings with 10 μm GA4 and visualized the MT array by confocal microscopy 3 h after treatment (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION). For both the wild type and dex-induced synthetic double mutant, we found that GA4 treatment (n = 10 plants each) led to coaligned MT arrays, organized transverse to the plant growth axis (Figures 8E and 8F). We observed that the degree of MT coalignment was visually indistinguishable from control plants treated with GA4. These data indicate that reduction of MAP65-1 and MAP65-2 levels does not significantly impede the MTs from organizing into an array that is transversely coaligned to the plant growth axis.
!~MM~! Arabidopsis thaliana seeds were surface sterilized (<10 s) in an aqueous solution of 1.5% hydrogen peroxide and 80% ethanol. Seeds were sown on half-strength Murashige and Skoog (MS) media solidified with 0.8% agar (Sigma-Aldrich) with no added sugar source. All seeds were incubated for 2 d at 4°C in the dark before being placed in a 22°C Percival incubator with continuous light. Dark-grown plants were exposed to light for 2 to 6 h in the incubator and then wrapped in a double layer of aluminum foil or placed in a light tight box. Full-length genomic clones for MAP65-1 and MAP65-2 genes were PCR amplified from Arabidopsis Col-0 DNA, verified by complete sequencing, and inserted into pPZP211x binary plasmid vectors (CITATION). mCherry or eGFP sequences were amplified without the 3′ termination codon and cloned upstream of both genes. Genomic sequence upstream of both MAP65-1 (2.6 kb) and MAP65-2 (2.1 kb) was cloned and inserted upstream of the fluorescent protein sequence to drive gene expression. Inducible artificial microRNA constructs were created by PCR amplification of distinct sequence regions from MAP65-2 according to CITATION and insertion between flanking regions of the MIR319 microRNA. The artificial microRNAs were subsequently cloned into the pTA7001 binary vector (CITATION) for dex-inducible transcription. All sequence-confirmed constructs were transformed into Agrobacterium tumefacians strain GV3001 for use in plant transformations. Arabidopsis plants were transformed via the floral dip method (CITATION). Prior to transformation, bacterial cultures were resuspended in a virulence induction medium containing 0.1 mM acetosyringone for 4 to 8 h. Bacteria were resuspended in water containing 5% Suc and 0.02% Silwet L-77 immediately prior to dipping. Transgenic plants were selected on half-strength MS plates supplemented with 10 μg/mL carbenicillin and either 25 μg/mL kanamycin or 5 μg/μL hygromycin. Seeds were incubated on plates for 4 d at 4°C in darkness, exposed to 2 to 6 h of light, wrapped in foil, and placed vertically in an incubator. Plants were grown for 10 d at 22°C before measurement. Oryzalin (5 μM) supersensitivity and dex induction (5 μM) assays were performed in 5 mL of liquid half-strength MS culture. Ethanol (95%) was used for mock treatment of dex. Hypocotyl length was measured using ImageJ (NIH freeware) from images taken on a stereoscopic microscope. Graphs were created with Kaleidograph (Synergy Software). Seedlings were mounted in liquid half-strength MS between a glass slide and a cover slip held together with silicone vacuum grease. Mounted seedlings were rested for >20 min before imaging. Fluorescence images were created using a Leica SP5 microscope with an acousto-optical beam splitter system for creating spectral emission windows. We used either a ×10 0.40 numerical aperture (N.A.), ×20 water immersion 0.70 N.A., ×40 oil immersion 1.25 N.A., or ×63 water immersion 1.2 N.A. lens using 488-nm excitation for GFP and 561-nm excitation for mCherry probes. FRAP was performed using the Leica live-cell FRAP tool for one- or two-color channels on the Leica SP5 and setting initial detector values to 80% of maximum. For MAP65 fusion proteins, regions of individual bundles were highlighted for bleaching and recovery using flanking regions of the bundle for estimation of photobleaching. Single exponential functions were fit to photobleach-corrected average pixel intensity data, and the half time to recovery (t1/2) was calculated from a least squares best fit model (CITATION). For MT arrays, 10-μm-diameter circles were bleached and recovery was plotted from time-lapse frames taken at 9-s intervals for 5 min (CITATION). For fitting, all data were normalized for imaging-related photobleaching during postbleach time lapse (CITATION), and the average of all experimental traces from the wild type or synthetic double mutant was fit with a single exponential curve. Surface rendering of hypocotyls was created from through-focal series of propidium iodide–stained hypocotyls. Hypocotyls were stained for 2 h in 20 μg/mL propidium iodide and 0.002% Silwet in half-strength liquid MS media. The 488-nm laser line was used to excite the stain, and the acousto-optical beam splitter was set to capture 550- to 650-nm light emission. Optical stacks of images were rendered using Imaris Bitplane software. RNA was extracted from 5-d-old light-grown seedlings using the Spectrum plant total RNA kit (Sigma-Aldrich). cDNA was produced from 3 ng of total RNA using Superscript III (Invitrogen) reverse transcriptase. Relative RNA amounts were determined by qPCR using the Brilliant II SYBR Green qPCR Master Mix and MxPro3000 qPCR system (Stratagene). A comparative Ct method was used to determine relative quantities (relative quantity = 2(−((Ct GOI unknown − Ct normalizer unknown) − (Ct GOI calibrator – Ct normalizer calibrator))), where GOI is the gene of interest. qPCR was performed in triplicate on three different biological samples. A clathrin adapter subunit was used for normalization (CITATION). Transcript-specific primer sequences are as follows: MAP65-1 F1, 5′-GCCTTGAGATAGAGAGCCCATAAAG-3′; MAP65-1 R1, 5′-TGCCTTGCCTCTTGGGCGC-3′; MAP65-2 F1, 5′-CGGGCAAGCAAGTCCAAGAGAGACAG-3′; MAP65-2 R1, 5′-AAGCCATCACTGGGTCAGCACGAG-3′; At4g24550 F1, 5′-TGGTAATCCAGAAATCCGTTTAGC-3′; At4g24550 R1, 5′-ACCCCTGAACCTGAAGAACTCC-3′. Protein extracts were created by grinding 20 seedlings in liquid nitrogen for 30 s using plastic pestles in 2.0 mL centrifuge tubes before adding 2% SDS solubilization buffer. Solubilization buffer contained a protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma-Aldrich) and 0.01% DTT. Samples were boiled for 10 min followed by maximum speed centrifugation for 10 min. Protein samples and BenchMark Prestained Protein Ladder (Invitrogen) were loaded onto 10% polyacrylimade gels and subjected to electrophoresis. Protein loading was assessed by comparing lanes from Commassie Brilliant Blue–stained gels and adjusting load volumes for immunoblots. For blotting, protein was transferred electrophoretically to nitrocellulose membrane, and the membrane was blocked overnight in nonfat milk and incubated with anti-MAP65-1 antibody (that also recognizes MAP65-2) diluted 1:1000 (kind gift from Andrei Smertenko) for >2 h followed by incubation in secondary anti-rabbit sera >2 h. Immunoblots were developed using the Pierce ECL reagent (Thermo Scientific) and Classic Blue Autoradiography BX film (Midsci). Kymographs were generated from time-lapse images (3.98-s interval) of cells expressing both mCherry:MAP65-2 and GFP:TUA6 (ImageJ). From kymographs, the rate of growth and shortening was determined by measuring the slope of the excursions and correcting for pixels per micrometer. Measurements for mCherry:MAP65-2 and GFP:TUA6 were made in the same cells and were generated from 13 cells total taken from three different plants.
