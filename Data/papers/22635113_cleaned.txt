!~ABS~! 2-Hydroxy fatty acids (2-HFAs) are predominantly present in sphingolipids and have important physicochemical and physiological functions in eukaryotic cells. Recent studies from our group demonstrated that sphingolipid fatty acid 2-hydroxylase (FAH) is required for the function of Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) Bax inhibitor-1 (AtBI-1), which is an endoplasmic reticulum membrane-localized cell death suppressor. However, little is known about the function of two Arabidopsis FAH homologs (AtFAH1 and AtFAH2), and it remains unclear whether 2-HFAs participate in cell death regulation. In this study, we found that both AtFAH1 and AtFAH2 had FAH activity, and the interaction with Arabidopsis cytochrome b5 was needed for the sufficient activity. 2-HFA analysis of AtFAH1 knockdown lines and atfah2 mutant showed that AtFAH1 mainly 2-hydroxylated very-long-chain fatty acid (VLCFA), whereas AtFAH2 selectively 2-hydroxylated palmitic acid in Arabidopsis. In addition, 2-HFAs were related to resistance to oxidative stress, and AtFAH1 or 2-hydroxy VLCFA showed particularly strong responses to oxidative stress. Furthermore, AtFAH1 interacted with AtBI-1 via cytochrome b5 more preferentially than AtFAH2. Our results suggest that AtFAH1 and AtFAH2 are functionally different FAHs, and that AtFAH1 or 2-hydroxy VLCFA is a key factor in AtBI-1-mediated cell death suppression.
!~RES~! We showed previously that AtFAH2 is localized in the ER (CITATION). To investigate whether AtFAH1 has the same function as AtFAH2 or not, we first confirmed the subcellular localization of AtFAH1. Fusion constructs of AtFAH1 were generated using genes encoding GFP driven by the cauliflower mosaic virus 35S (CaMV35S) promoter. When bombarded in onion (Allium cepa) epidermal cells, AtFAH1-GFP was localized in the cell periphery, the perinuclear region, and the reticulum network (Fig. 1, A and D). In addition, AtFAH1-GFP was colocalized always with AtFAH2-RFP (Fig. 1, A–C), suggesting that AtFAH1 also localizes in the ER. [[FIGURE]] As described above, neither AtFAH1 nor AtFAH2 has any Cb5-like domains (CITATION; CITATION). CITATION demonstrated that the Cb5-like domain is essential for human FA2H activity, implying that AtFAH1 and AtFAH2 require an ER-localized AtCb5 to increase their activity. In fact, we have already demonstrated that both AtFAH1 and AtFAH2 interacted with all ER-localized AtCb5 in yeast cells. In addition, the interaction between AtFAH2 and AtCb5-B, which is one of four ER-type AtCb5s, was reported in plant cells using a fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) analysis (CITATION). Accordingly, we attempted to verify the interaction between AtFAH1 and AtCb5-B in plant cells by using a bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) assay. The nYFP-pUGW0 vector contains nYFP (1–174 amino acids) in the N-terminal side of the target proteins, driven by CaMV35S promoter, whereas the cYFP-pUGW2 vector contains cYFP (175–239 amino acids) in the C-terminal side (CITATION; Fig. 1E). When nYFP-AtCb5-B and AtFAH1-cYFP were transiently coexpressed in onion epidermal cells, we observed BiFC fluorescence that was highly localized in the cell periphery and the perinuclear regions (Fig. 1, F and L). This signal was similar to that of nYFP-AtCb5-B/AtFAH2-cYFP in terms of localization and intensity (Fig. 1, F, H, L, and N). In contrast, no fluorescent signal was visible using empty vectors (nYFP/cYFP; Fig. 1J). In these studies, DsRed driven by CaMV35S promoter was used as an expression marker of particle bombardment (Fig. 1, G, I, K, M, and O). These results suggest that not only AtFAH2 but also AtFAH1 interacts with AtCb5-B in plant cells. To clarify whether AtFAH1 and AtFAH2 are FAHs, we performed a complementation test using yeast ScFAH1-deletion variant (Δfah1), which cannot produce any 2-HFAs. In these experiments, AtFAH1 or AtFAH2 was transformed into Δfah1, and total lipids were extracted using the Folch method described previously (CITATION). 2-HFA methyl esters were fractionated by thin-layer chromatography (TLC) after derivatization of fatty acids, and were detected by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). In this assay, 2-hydroxy hexacosanoic acid (26h:0) was evaluated as a marker of 2-HFAs, because 26h:0 occupied almost all 2-HFAs in yeast (CITATION). As shown in Figure 2, 26h:0 accumulated in AtFAH1- or AtFAH2-expressing Δfah1, but not in Δfah1, suggesting that both AtFAH1 and AtFAH2 have FAH activity. However, these levels were quite less than those of the wild type and Δfah1 expressing ScFAH1 (Fig. 2). This finding may be due to the structural difference between ScFAH1 and AtFAHs with or without Cb5-like domain, respectively (CITATION; CITATION). Transformation of AtCb5-B into AtFAH1- or AtFAH2-expressing Δfah1 resulted in a marked increase in the amounts of 26h:0 (Fig. 2). AtCb5-B itself exhibited no FAH activity, because no 26h:0 was detected in AtCb5-B-expressing Δfah1 (Fig. 2). These results indicate that AtCb5 is a key factor for the activity of AtFAH1 and AtFAH2. [[FIGURE]] To elucidate the roles of AtFAH1 and AtFAH2 in 2-HFA synthesis pathway and the physiological functions in Arabidopsis, we searched for AtFAHs knockout lines. However, no suitable T-DNA insertion line for AtFAH1 is available among the existing T-DNA mutant collections. We therefore generated AtFAH1 knockdown transgenic lines (AtFAH1-KD) by RNA interference with 100 bp of 3′ untranslated region in AtFAH1 cDNA as a trigger (Fig. 3A). Reverse transcription (RT)-PCR analysis confirmed that AtFAH1 was markedly reduced in AtFAH1-KD-1 and -2 lines (Fig. 3C). In contrast, we obtained T-DNA-tagged Arabidopsis line in AtFAH2 gene (SALK_011293, atfah2), which has a T-DNA insertion in third exon (Fig. 3B). As shown in Figure 3C, not only the full-length AtFAH2 mRNA (primer a-b), but also the upstream region of T-DNA insertion site in AtFAH2 gene (primer a-c) was completely deleted. AtFAH1-KD and atfah2 plants showed no apparent phenotype compared with the 3-week-old wild-type (Columbia-0) plants under normal growth condition (Fig. 3D). [[FIGURE]] We first dissected 2-HFA composition in these transgenic plants. Total lipids including total sphingolipids were extracted from the aboveground parts in 3-week-old plants according to CITATION, and these 2-HFA methyl esters were detected with GC-MS after derivatization. In this study, we analyzed five major 2-HFAs (16h:0, 22h:0, 24h:0, 24h:1, and 26h:0) of 13 2-HFAs in Arabidopsis (CITATION). In the AtFAH1-KD lines, the levels of 22h:0, 24h:0, and 26h:0 were considerably lower than in wild type, whereas the level of 16h:0 was marginally decreased (Fig. 4, A and B). In contrast, the level of 16h:0 was markedly reduced by 22.9% in atfah2 mutant, whereas the levels of other 2-HFAs were similar to those in wild type (Fig. 4, A and B). Thus, these results suggest that VLCFA is 2-hydroxylated by AtFAH1, whereas palmitic acid is 2-hydroxylated by AtFAH2 and marginally AtFAH1. [[FIGURE]] Our previous report suggested that FAH is related to AtBI-1-mediated suppression of cell death (CITATION). Because AtBI-1 is reported to suppress oxidative-stress-induced cell death (CITATION; CITATION), we tested the sensitivity of AtFAH1-KD and atfah2 plants to oxidative stress by using ROS-inducing chemicals, hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), and menadione (MD; CITATION). Treatment of leaf discs obtained from 3-week-old plants with 100 mm H2O2 or 60 μm MD for 24 h significantly increased electrolyte leakage in AtFAH1-KD and atfah2 plants compared with wild type (Fig. 5A). Electrolyte leakage measurement is the assay often used to examine irreversible membrane damage by oxidative stress or during cell death. In addition, chlorophyll contents in AtFAH1-KD and atfah2 plants were lower than wild type (Fig. 5B), indicating that AtFAH1-KD and atfah2 plants have higher sensitivity to oxidative stress. Moreover, AtFAH2 gene controlled by its native promoter (pAtFAH2::AtFAH2, Fig. 5C) complemented the atfah2 phenotype for oxidative-stress-induced ion leakage and chlorophyll contents (Fig. 5, A and B). These results suggest the involvement of 2-HFAs in the resistant response to oxidative stress. [[FIGURE]] Next, the expression levels of AtFAH1 and AtFAH2 mRNAs in response to H2O2 were examined. Total mRNAs were extracted from 10-d-old wild-type plants treated with 100 mm H2O2 for 1, 3, 5, 7, and 24 h. RT-PCR analysis showed that AtFAH1 mRNA increased rapidly at 1 h and subsequently remained at higher levels than no treatment, although they were decreased slightly with time (Fig. 6A). AtFAH2 mRNA diminished gradually from 3 h and was only expressed weakly at 24 h. Incidentally, AtBI-1 mRNA continued to increase gradually in response to H2O2 until 24 h. These results imply that AtFAH1 promptly responds to oxidative stress, whereas AtFAH2 does not. [[FIGURE]] To clarify the roles of 2-HFAs in the response to oxidative stress, we examined changes in fatty acids in response to oxidative stress. Four-week-old Arabidopsis wild-type plants were treated with H2O2 for 24 h, and their derivatized 2-HFA methyl esters and nonhydroxy fatty acid (non-HFA) methyl esters were analyzed by GC-MS. As shown in Figure 6B, the total non-HFA content was significantly lower at 24 h after treatment with H2O2. In contrast, total 2-HFA content was higher at 24 h after treatment with H2O2 (Fig. 6C). However, the amount of 16h:0 was not affected by H2O2 (Fig. 6D), whereas the levels of total 2-hydroxy VLCFAs were especially elevated (Fig. 6E). These results suggest the importance of 2-hydroxy VLCFAs under oxidative stress condition. To further confirm the relationship between AtFAHs and oxidative stress, we analyzed the levels of oxidative-stress-related metabolites in the leaves of 3-week-old AtFAH1-KD and atfah2 plants grown under normal growth conditions by using a capillary electrophoresis (CE)-MS. As shown in Figure 7, reduced glutathione (GSH) level in AtFAH1-KD was significantly lower than wild-type plants, whereas oxidized glutathione (GSSG) was markedly higher, resulting in reduced rate of GSH in total glutathione in spite of the lower total glutathione in AtFAH1-KD lines (Fig. 7, A–D). In addition, reduced ascorbate was markedly lower in AtFAH1-KD lines (Fig. 7E). Moreover, γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) was markedly increased compared with wild-type plants (Fig. 7F). In contrast, the levels of glutathione, reduced ascorbate, and GABA in atfah2 were similar to those in wild type (Fig. 7, A–F). [[FIGURE]] Ascorbate (vitamin C) is the most important reducing substrate for H2O2 detoxification in plant cells, and the series of ROS-scavenging reactions accompanied by glutathione is called the ascorbate-glutathione cycle (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION). When plants are exposed to ROS-mediated stresses, glutathione-ascorbate cycle participates in detoxification of ROS at the expense of electrons from the GSH pool, causing a transient increase in GSSG (CITATION). In addition, GABA is a four-carbon nonprotein amino acid that is rapidly and markedly produced in response to biotic and abiotic stress (CITATION; CITATION). Therefore, these results indicate that AtFAH1-KD lines are exposed to some stress even under nonstress conditions. Taken together, the results indicate that 2-HFAs seem important in the plant machinery that serves to resist oxidative stress, and that the role of 2-hydroxy VLCFAs in oxidative stress response seems different from that of 16h:0. To reinforce the link between AtFAH and AtBI-1-mediated suppression of cell death, we examined the three-way interaction among AtBI-1, AtCb5, and AtFAH in plant cells using the BiFC-based FRET assay in plant cells. This assay detects ternary complexes in living cells by the combination of BiFC and FRET assays (CITATION, CITATION; CITATION; CITATION). When the combination of AtBI-1-CFP, nYFP-AtCb5-B, and AtFAH1-cYFP, and the combination of AtBI-1-CFP, nYFP-AtCb5-B, and AtFAH2-cYFP were transiently expressed in onion epidermal cells, CFP fluorescence and BiFC signal were completely merged in both combinations (Fig. 8, A–F). We next examined the interactions between AtBI-1 and AtCb5-B/AtFAH1 or AtCb5-B/AtFAH2 by FRET-acceptor photobleaching analysis. The mean FRET efficiency was 17.4% ± 5.58% for the pair of AtBI-1-CFP and nYFP-AtCb5-B/AtFAH1-cYFP (Fig. 8G). In contrast, the pair of AtBI-1-CFP and nYFP-AtCb5-B/AtFAH2-cYFP showed a lower-level FRET efficiency (6.8% ± 2.72%), although the efficiency was significantly higher than control experiments (CFP + YFP, 3.19% ± 2.8%; Fig. 8G). These results suggest preferential ternary interactions among AtBI-1, AtCb5, and AtFAH1, and strongly support the significance of AtFAH1 in AtBI-1-mediated cell death regulation (Fig. 9).

!~MM~! The Columbia ecotype of Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) was used in all experiments. The T-DNA insertion mutant of AtFAH2 was obtained from the SALK Institute (SALK_011293). To generate AtFAH1-KD and atfah2/pAtFAH2::AtFAH2 lines, pK7GWIWG2(II)-AtFAH1 and pMDC99-AtFAH2 were constructed, respectively. Briefly, the 3′-untranslated region of AtFAH1-cDNA (amplified by the primers: 5′-ACAAAAGCCCCCAGAAAAGA-3′ and 5′-AGAAGGATGATTAATAACT-3′), or putative native promoter and gene region of AtFAH2 (amplified by the primers: 5′-GTGGAAAGCCTCATTGCTATATC-3′ and 5′-GGGAATCAAAGAAAAGTGAAATC-3′) were introduced into the pK7GWIWG2(II) or pMDC99 plasmids, respectively (CITATION; CITATION), by the Gateway system. The resulting plasmid was transferred to Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain EHA105 (CITATION) using the freeze-thaw method (CITATION). Transformations of Arabidopsis plants were carried out by the floral-dip method (CITATION). Arabidopsis plants were cultivated at 23°C under continuous light (60 μmol m−2 s−1). GFP fusion protein with AtFAH1 (amplified by the primers: 5′-ATGGTTGCTCAGGGATTCAC-3′ and 5′-TTGCTCTTTTCTGGGGGCTT-3′) was prepared by amplification of the AtFAH1 open reading frame without the stop codon. PCR product was introduced into the pEarley-gate 103 (CITATION) by the Gateway system to generate the GFP C-terminal fusion construct, AtFAH1-GFP. Similarly, AtFAH2 (amplified by the primers: 5′-ATGGTTGCAGAACGATACAC-3′ and 5′-GCTCTTCTTCGCAGCGGCTTTAATA-3′) fusion protein with RFP at its C terminus was generated using the destination vector pK2GW7-TagRFP, which was kindly provided by Dr. Doniwa (University of Tokyo). The plasmid DNA was introduced into onion (Allium cepa) epidermal cells by particle bombardment with two helium-driven particle accelerators (PDS/1000; Bio-Rad or GIE-3 IDERA; TANAKA), as described by CITATION and CITATION, respectively. Confocal laser microscopy was carried out with Nikon TE-2000U or Leica TCS-SP5. In both systems, a 488-nm Ar/Kr laser was used for the excitation of GFP. A 543-nm He/Ne laser was also used for RFP. Emission signals were detected using 515/30-nm filter for GFP, and a 590/70-nm or 570-nm long-pass filter for RFP. Plasmids for BiFC analysis were kindly provided by Dr. Nakagawa (Shimane University). AtFAH1 and AtFAH2 open reading frames without their stop codons were combined with the BiFC destination vector cYFP-pUGW2 (CITATION) by the Gateway system to generate the cYFP (175–239 amino acids) C-terminal fusion constructs, AtFAH1-cYFP and AtFAH2-cYFP, respectively. Similarly, nYFP-AtCb5-B (amplified by the primers: 5′-ATGGGAGACGAAGCAAAGA-3′ and 5′-CCCTGATTTGGTGTAGATACGGATT-3′) fusion protein with nYFP (1–174 amino acids) at its N terminus was generated using the destination vector nYFP-pUGW0 (CITATION). The mixed plasmid DNA was introduced into onion epidermal cells by particle bombardment with helium-driven particle accelerator (GIE-3 IDERA; TANAKA). The CaMV35S-DsRed was also cobombarded to the cells as an expression marker. The BiFC signal was analyzed by fluorescence microscopy (DMRD; Leica) and confocal laser microscopy (TCS-SP5; Leica). In the latter system, a 514-nm Ar laser was used for the excitation of YFP. A 543-nm He/Ne laser was also used for DsRed. Emission signals were detected using a 515/30-nm filter for YFP, and a 590/70-nm or 570-nm long-pass filter for DsRed. The CFP-fused construct and pair constructs for BiFC as a donor and an acceptor for FRET, respectively, were introduced into onion epidermal cells by particle bombardment with a helium-driven particle accelerator (PDS/1000; Bio-Rad). Confocal microscopy was carried out with Leica TCS-SP5. For FRET measurements, Leica FRET acceptor photobleaching was used according to the instructions provided by the manufacturer. EYFP was photobleached in a region 4 to 8 μm in diameter, by two to five scans with 514-nm laser at 100%. ECFP fluorescence intensity was quantified [before donor (d1)] and [after donor (d2)] acceptor photobleaching along the background fluorescence intensity (bk), and FRET efficiency was determined using the equation: {[(d2 − bk) − (d1 − bk)]/(d2 − bk)}. For measurement of ion leakage and chlorophyll content, and for RT-PCR analysis under oxidative stress condition, three leaf discs (5.5 mm in diameter) obtained from 3-week-old Arabidopsis plants were submerged in 1 mL of distilled water. After adding H2O2 or MD (Sigma) to become 100 mm or 60 μm, respectively, the leaf discs were vacuumed for 5 min. The floating discs were incubated at 23°C under continuous light (60 μmol m−2 s−1) without shaking for several times. For fatty acid analysis, 250 mg of whole rosettes of Arabidopsis were submerged in 20 mL of 100 mm H2O2 (Wako), which was diluted with distilled water, for 24 h, and washed in distilled water before extraction of total lipids. Total RNA was extracted from Arabidopsis leaf discs of seedlings using the RNeasy plant mini prep kit (Qiagen) and 1 μg was used as a template for RT-PCR with specific primers for AtFAH1 (amplified by the primers: 5′-ATGGTTGCTCAGGGATTCAC-3′ and 5′-TTGCTCTTTTCTGGGGGCTT-3′), AtFAH2 (amplified by the following primers: 5′-ATGGTTGCAGAACGATACAC-3′ and 5′-GCTCTTCTTCGCAGCGGCTT-3′), AtBI-1 (amplified by the primers: 5′-ATGGATGCGTTCTCTTCCTTC-3′ and 5′-GTTTCTCCTTTTCTTCTTCT-3′), Actin2 (amplified by the primers: 5′-GAGATTCACATGCCCAGAAGTCTTG-3′ and 5′-ACCTGCCTCATCATACTCGGC-3′), and Actin8 (amplified by the primers: 5′-TGAGCCAGTCTTCATCGTC-3′ and 5′-TCTCTTGCTCGTAGTCGACA-3′). The conditions for direct amplification with Ready-to-Go RT-PCR beads (GE Health Care) were one cycle at 42°C for 25 min and 95°C for 5 min; 25 cycles at 95°C for 30 s, at 55°C for 30 s, and at 72°C for 1 min. The yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) gene disruption mutant (Δfah1) was purchased from Euroscarf. Plasmid vectors for overexpression in yeast cells were kindly provided by Dr. Ralph Panstruga and Dr. I.E. Somssich. To generate pMet-AtFAH1 and pMet-AtFAH2, AtFAH1 and AtFAH2 open reading frames with their stop codons were combined with the destination vector pMet-Cub-Ura3 by the Gateway system, respectively. The construction of pMet-ScFAH1 was described in our previous work (CITATION). The PCR-amplified coding region of AtCb5-B with the stop codon (amplified by the primers: 5′-CGGGATCCATGGGAGACGAAGCAAAGA-3′ and 5′-CGGGATCCCCCTGATTTGGTGTAGATAC-3′) was introduced into the BamHI site of pACT2 vector (Clontech) to generate pACT2-AtCb5-B. Wild-type (BY4741) cells and Δfah1 mutants were transformed, and the transformant cells were cultured in liquid medium for 1 d. Total lipids in each transformant were extracted according to the method described previously (CITATION). 2-HFA methyl esters with 2-hydroxy pentadecanoic acid (15h:0) methyl ester as an internal standard were prepared and separated by silica gel TLC using n-hexane/diethyl ether (4:1, vol/vol) as the mobile phase, as described by CITATION. Total lipids including sphingolipids were extracted from whole rosettes of Arabidopsis (300 mg fresh weight) according to the method described by CITATION. Total other lipids mainly including nonhydroxyl fatty acids were extracted from rosettes of Arabidopsis (1 g fresh weight) according to the method described by CITATION. 2-HFA methyl esters with 15h:0 methyl ester as an internal standard, or non-HFA methyl esters with margaric acid (17:0) methyl ester as an internal standard were prepared and separated by silica gel TLC using n-hexane/diethyl ether (4:1, vol/vol) as the mobile phase as described by CITATION. Derivatized 2-HFA samples were analyzed by GC (GC-2010, Shimadzu Scientific) as described by CITATION. Similarly, derivatized non-HFA samples were analyzed by GC with the injector set in split mode. The analytes were fractionated on a Restek RTX-5 column (5% diphenyl polysiloxane, 95% dimethyl polysiloxane; 0.25 mm i.d., 0.25 μm D.F., 30 m), and the injection port and the transfer line were maintained at 250°C. The column temperature was programmed from 100°C (2-min hold) to 280°C at 4°C/min and maintained at 280°C for another 30 min. The absolute values of non-HFA were computed like those of 2-HFA as described by CITATION. Electrolyte leakage was monitored using an electrical conductivity meter (Horiba, B-173) at several time points, and expressed as a relative value against total ion leakage, which was measured in the autoclaved samples (CITATION). Three leaf discs from 3-week-old plants treated with various chemicals were soaked overnight in 1 mL of dimethyl formamide at 4°C. The chlorophyll content of the extract was then determined spectrophotometrically as described previously (CITATION). For measurements using CE-MS, metabolites were extracted using methanol-MilliQ water (1:1) as described by CITATION. Leaf samples were obtained, immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80°C until further analysis. The metabolites were extracted by rapid grinding of tissues in liquid nitrogen followed by immediate addition of 10 volumes of ice-cooled methanol (10 μL mg−1 fresh weight) including 50 μm internal standards; Met sulfone was mixed by a vortex mixer for 1 min at 4°C and equal volume of Milli-Q water was added to the sample mixture. After centrifugation for 5 min at 15,000g, the supernatant was ultrafiltrated through a 5-kD cutoff filter (Amicon). The filtrate was analyzed using the CE-MS method. Separation and determination of metabolites were performed using the CE/MS system (Agilent Technologies). For the determination of anionic compounds, separations were carried out using fused-silica capillary (50 μm i.d. × 80 cm total length) filled with 50 mm ammonium acetate (pH 9.0) as the electrolyte according to the pressure-assisted CE-MS method (CITATION). Cationic compounds were separated in an uncoated fused-silica capillary (50 μm i.d. × 100 cm total length) using 1 m formic acid (pH 1.9) as the electrolyte (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION). Sequence data from this article can be found in the Arabidopsis Genome Initiative or GeneBank/EMBL databases under the following accession numbers: AtFAH1, At2g34770; AtFAH2, At4g20870; AtCb5-B, At2g32720; AtBI-1, At5g47120.
