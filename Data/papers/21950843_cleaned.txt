!~ABS~! Ubiquinone (coenzyme Q) is the generic name of a class of lipid-soluble electron carriers formed of a redox active benzoquinone ring attached to a prenyl side chain. The length of the latter varies among species, and depends upon the product specificity of a trans-long-chain prenyl diphosphate synthase that elongates an allylic diphosphate precursor. In Arabidopsis, this enzyme is assumed to correspond to an endoplasmic reticulum-located solanesyl diphosphate synthase, although direct genetic evidence was lacking. In this study, the reconstruction of the functional network of Arabidopsis genes linked to ubiquinone biosynthesis singled out an unsuspected solanesyl diphosphate synthase candidate – product of gene At2g34630 – that, extraordinarily, had been shown previously to be targeted to plastids and to contribute to the biosynthesis of gibberellins. Green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusion experiments in tobacco and Arabidopsis, and complementation of a yeast coq1 knockout lacking mitochondrial hexaprenyl diphosphate synthase demonstrated that At2g34630 is also targeted to mitochondria. At2g34630 is the main – if not sole – contributor to solanesyl diphosphate synthase activity required for the biosynthesis of ubiquinone, as demonstrated by the dramatic (75–80%) reduction of the ubiquinone pool size in corresponding RNAi lines. Overexpression of At2g34630 gave up to a 40% increase in ubiquinone content compared to wild-type plants. None of the silenced or overexpressing lines, in contrast, displayed altered levels of plastoquinone. Phylogenetic analyses revealed that At2g34630 is the only Arabidopsis trans-long-chain prenyl diphosphate synthase that clusters with the Coq1 orthologs involved in the biosynthesis of ubiquinone in other eukaryotes.
!~RES~! Using the microarray co-response module of the Golm Comprehensive Systems-Biology Database (http://csbdb.mpimp-golm.mpg.de/csbdb/dbcor/ath.html) to explo- re the functional network of the Arabidopsis Coq/Ubi orthologs, four terpene biosynthetic genes were identified (Figure 2). Three of them, At4g11820, At1g76490 and At2g 17370, encode for enzymes involved in the formation of mevalonic acid, namely 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl co-enzyme A (CoA) synthase, and 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl CoA reductase 1 and 2, respectively (Figure S1 shows the location of these enzymes and of the Coq/Ubi co-expressors in their cognate metabolic branches). The fourth gene, At2g34630, encodes for a member of the trans-prenyl diphosphate synthase family (conserved domain cd00685). A recombinant version of the corresponding enzyme was recently shown to generate medium- and long-chain allylic diphosphate as reaction products in vitro (CITATION). Transcript profiles deduced from microarray data (http://www.bar.utoronto.ca/efp; CITATION) indicated that At2g34630 expression is ubiquitous in the tissues investigated, and peaks in seeds and shoot apical meristems. [[FIGURE]] Mining the 22 800-microarray elements of the ATTED-II database (http://atted.jp/; CITATION) with the At2g34630 gene as query detected an overwhelming proportion (59%) of mitochondrial proteins in the 100 most significant co-expressors, including the Coq8 and Coq9 orthologs, and components of the respiratory chain (At5g66760 and At3g27380, succinate dehydrogenase; At5g56090, cytochrome c oxidase (COX) 15; At3g15352, copper chaperone COX17; At2g44520, COX10; At4g10040, cytochrome c-2). The remainder of these top co-expressors is split between genes encoding proteins targeted to the nucleus and the cytosol (17%), plasma membrane and endoplasmic reticulum (11%), plastids (9%), and vacuole (4%). That At2g34630’s functional network is predominated by genes linked to mitochondrial metabolism is a priori surprising, for the At2g34630 protein had been previously detected in plastids and proposed to participate in the biosynthesis of gibberellic acid (CITATION; CITATION). To clarify the apparent discrepancy between the pre-existing evidence for the compartmentalization of At2g34630 into plastids and co-expression data, we re-investigated the subcellular targeting of this protein using fluorescent reporters and confocal laser scanning microscopy. For that an approximately 4.36 kb genomic fragment comprised of At2g34630 sequence (minus its stop codon), its 5′-UTR and its native promoter were cloned in frame to the 5′-end of green fluorescent protein (GFP). Transient expression of the At2g34630–GFP fused construct in tobacco leaf tissues resulted in a punctate pattern of green fluorescence, some of which clearly co-localized with the autofluorescence of chlorophyll into plastids (Figure 3a–c). However, the GFP-associated fluorescence was also observed in much smaller structures quickly streaming along strands of cytosol, and which were reminiscent of mitochondria (Figure 3a,c; Video Clip S1). To investigate this point, GFP-tagged At2g34630 was co-infiltrated with a mitochondrial marker consisting of the N-terminal region of isovaleryl-CoA dehydrogenase fused to red fluorescent protein (RFP) (CITATION). Co-expression of these constructs showed that the green fluorescence of GFP co-localized with the red pseudocolor of RFP in mitochondria (Figure 3d–f). To confirm these findings, the At2g34630–GFP construct was introduced into Arabidopsis for stable expression. Imaging of the leaves of T1 transgenics demonstrated that here again the green fluorescence of GFP was associated with small and highly mobile punctate structures distinctive of mitochondria (Figure 3g,i). As observed in tobacco, the fluorescence of GFP was also found in much larger structures that co-localized with the autofluorescence of chlorophyll (Figure 3f,g). These data demonstrate that when either transiently or stably expressed under the control of its native promoter, the At2g34630 protein is dual targeted to mitochondria and plastids. [[FIGURE]] Having shown that At2g34630 co-expresses with known and predicted ubiquinone biosynthetic genes and that its cognate protein occurs in the mitochondrion as well as in plastids, we inferred that At2g34630 was a good candidate gene for the trans-long-chain prenyl diphosphate synthase that makes the side chain of ubiquinone-9 in Arabidopsis. To investigate this point, At2g34630 full-length cDNA was subcloned into yeast expression vector pYES-DEST52 and the resulting construct was introduced into a S. cerevisiae coq1 knockout. This strain, which lacks mitochondrial hexaprenyl diphosphate synthase activity, is devoid of ubiquinone-6 and cannot grow on non-fermentable carbon substrates (CITATION). Expression of the Arabidopsis protein restored the ability of the mutant cells to use glycerol and ethanol as sole carbon sources, and the growth of these cells was indistinguishable from that of the knockout strain after re-introduction of the coq1 gene (Figure 4a). No functional rescue was seen when the mutant cells were transformed with the vector-alone control (Figure 4a). To corroborate this result, the ubiquinone content of each strain was analyzed by high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC). As expected no ubiquinone was detected in the vector-alone control, while the extract of cells complemented with the coq1 gene contained ubiquinone-6 and forms with shorter side chains (Figure 4b). In contrast, the extract of cells harboring the plant construct displayed ubiquinone versions with longer side chain, namely ubiquinone-9, -8, and -7, and traces of ubiquinone 6 (Figure 4b). The relative quantities of various ubiquinone forms were equally distributed between ubiquinone-6 and those with shorter side chains in the coq1-complemented cells, and between ubiquinone-9, -8, and -7 in cells expressing the Arabidopsis protein (Table 1). The total ubiquinone content of these two complemented strains was virtually identical (Table 1). Taken together these data indicate that At2g34630 is imported into yeast mitochondria, where it functionally replaces the Coq1 protein and confers trans-long-chain prenyl diphosphate synthase activity – including solanesyl diphosphate synthase – but still say nothing about its function in plants. [[FIGURE]] Extracts of wild-type (WT) and of coq1 knockout yeast cells transformed with empty vector (Δcoq1/pYES), or harboring yeast Coq1 (Δcoq1/Coq1) or Arabidopsis At2g34630 (Δcoq1/At2g34630) cDNAs were separated by high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC). Ubiquinone was quantified by diode-array spectrophotometry. Ubiquinone forms with side chains shorter than C30 (UQ < 6) and for which external standards were not available were identified by their absorption spectra. Dashes indicate that no ubiquinone was detected (detection limit 0.1 pmol unit−1 OD600 nm). Data are means ± standard error (SE) of three replicates. As homozygous T-DNA knockouts corresponding to At2g34630 are embryo lethal, an alternative silencing approach was used to directly investigate the function of this gene in Arabidopsis. Using previously generated RNAi lines (CITATION), we selected three lines (lines 1–3) with severe silencing of At2g34630 and, as control, two lines (lines 4 and 5) with no significant change in expression compared with wild-type level (Figure 5a). Consistent with these expression profiles, HPLC analyses showed that the ubiquinone-9 content in lines 1–3 was reduced by 75–80% compared with that of wild-type plants, but was not altered in lines 4 and 5 (Figure 5b). [[FIGURE]] In a complementary strategy to deregulate the expression of At2g34630, we generated stable Arabidopsis lines overexpressing the gene’s full-length cDNA under the control of the constitutive 35S promoter. Here again, transformants were selected to cover a wide range of expression levels of the transgene: line 1 displayed marginal overexpression compared with that of the wild-type control, while lines 2 and 3 showed massive accumulation of the transcript (Figure 6a). As observed with the RNAi lines, the ubiquinone-9 content of the transgenics paralleled transcript levels showing a 10% increase in line 1, and a 40% increase in lines 2 and 3 (Figure 6b). [[FIGURE]] As At2g34630 co-occurs in plastid and displays solanesyl diphosphate synthase activity, we also investigated whether the enzyme could also participate in the biosynthesis of plastoquinone, which like ubiquinone-9 is made up of a benzoquinone ring attached to a solanesyl side chain. HPLC analyses showed no significant differences between the plastoquinone content of RNAi lines 1–3, overexpressing lines 2 and 3, and wild-type plants (Figure 7). [[FIGURE]] That At2g34630 participates in the biosynthesis of ubiquinone prompted us to revisit the evolutionary relationships of Arabidopsis trans-long-chain prenyl diphosphate synthases with their homologues in selected prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms. Once populated, a maximum likelihood tree segregated the plant enzymes into two phylogenetic clusters (Figure 8). The first clade, which contains At2g34630, encompasses the yeast Coq1 protein and its metazoan orthologs (Figure 8). The second one, in contrast, is made up exclusively of enzymes from oxygenic photosynthetic organisms. It includes At1g78510 – the solanesyl diphosphate synthase previously thought to be involved in ubiquinone biosynthesis – and a plastid-targeted paralog, At1g17050 (CITATION). Notably, these plant enzymes are monophyletic with trans-long-chain prenyl diphosphate synthases encoded in the plastid genomes of Rhodophytes (red algae), Glaucophytes, and Euglyphidae, signaling their ancestry as remnants of cyanobacterial endosymbionts (Figure 8).

!~MM~! Ubiquinone-10 was from Sigma-Aldrich (http://www.sigmaaldrich.com). External standards of ubiquinone-6, -7, -8, -9 and plastoquinone-9 were extracted from S. cerevisiae, Pseudomonas fluorescens, E. coli, Candida utilis, and A. thaliana respectively, and HPLC purified. Quinol calibration standards were chemically synthesized by reduction of their corresponding quinone counterparts with sodium borohydride. Calibration solutions were quantified spectrophotometrically using the molar extinction coefficients of 14 600 m−1 cm−1 at 275 nm for ubiquinone and of 15 200 m−1 cm−1 at 255 nm for plastoquinone-9 (CITATION). Unless otherwise mentioned other reagents were from Fisher Scientific. All DNA constructs were verified by sequencing. At2g34630 RNAi lines were from CITATION. Arabidopsis transgenics were selected on Murashige-Skoog solid medium containing either kanamycin (At2g34630 RNAi lines), or hygromycin (At2g34630–GFP fusion), or BASTA (At2g34630 overexpressors) and transferred to potting mix in a growth chamber at 22°C (100 μE m−2 sec−1) in 16-h days for 2–5 weeks. Tobacco plants (Nicotiana benthamiana) were grown in a greenhouse under natural light for 4–5 weeks. For expression of the At2g34630-GFP fusion under the control of At2g34630’s native promoter, a 4364-bp genomic DNA fragment including At2g34630 sequence (minus its stop codon) up to a portion of the 5′ upstream gene (At2g34620) was amplified using primers 5′-CCACATTCTTATCCACGAAAC-3′ (forward) and 5′- GAAGATCTCTTGTTTCTGGTGATGACTCT-3′ (reverse); the latter containing a BglII restriction site (italicized). The amplified product was cut with BglII, and ligated into EcoRI (blunted)/BglII-digested pCAMBIA-1302C (CITATION), effectively replacing the vector own 35S promoter and resulting in an in-frame fusion with the N-terminal end of GFP. This construct was electroporated into Agrobacterium tumefaciens C58C1, and the transformed cells were co-infiltrated into the leaves of Nicotiana benthamiana with an A. tumefaciens strain harboring pLN3639 that allowed expression of the N-terminal region of isovaleryl-CoA dehydrogenase fused to RFP as a marker of mitochondria (CITATION). Tobacco epidermal cells were imaged by confocal microscopy 2 days later. For imaging in Arabidopsis, the pCAMBIA-At2g34630-GFP construct was stably introduced into Arabidopsis plants using the floral dip method (CITATION). For the constitutive expression of At2g34630 under the control of the 35S promoter, full-length cDNA clone G68701 encoding At2g34630 (the Arabidopsis Biological Resource Center at the Ohio State University; http://abrc.osu.edu) was transferred into plant expression vector pB2GW7 (CITATION) using Gateway™ technology (Invitrogen; http://www.invitrogen.com). Total RNA from Arabidopsis leaves were extracted using the SV Total RNA Isolation System (Promega; http://www.promega.com). PCR was performed on cDNAs prepared from 500 ng of total RNA using the following gene-specific primers: At2g34630, 5′-AGGTAGAGACCCGATTGCAGC-3′ (forward) and 5′-TGAAATGATACACGTCGCAAGTC-3′ (reverse); actin control, 5′-CTAAGCTCTCAAGATCAAAGGC-3′ (forward) and 5′-TTAACATTGCAAAGAGTTTCAAGG-3′ (reverse). Full-length cDNA clone G68701 was transferred into yeast expression vector pYES-DEST52 using Gateway™ technology (Invitrogen). Yeast Coq1 gene was amplified from S. cerevisiae (strain BY4741) genomic DNA by using the primers 5′-CACCATGTTTCAAAGGTCTGGCGC-3′ (forward) and 5′-TTACTTTCTTCTTGTTAGTATACT-3′ (reverse). The resulting PCR product was cloned into pENTR/SD-TOPO vector (Invitrogen), and then transferred into pYES-DEST52. These constructs were separately introduced into yeast strain BY4741 (MATa his3Δ1 leu2Δ0 met15Δ0 ura3Δ0 YBR003W::kan; Open Biosystems clone 3138; http://www.openbiosystems.com) using Yeastmaker transformation kit (Clontech, http://www.clontech.com/). Transformants were selected at 30°C in synthetic minimal medium containing 0.67% (w/v) yeast nitrogen base with ammonium sulfate (MP biomedicals, http://www.mpbio.com), 2% glucose, G418 (200 μg ml−1), and appropriate amino acid supplements. For complementation analyses, similar number of cells of transformants and of their parent strain were plated on appropriately supplemented synthetic minimal media that contained 0.05% (w/v) d-galactose as an inducer, and either 2% (v/v) glucose or 3% (v/v) glycerol/2.5% (v/v) ethanol as carbon sources. Plates were incubated at 30°C for 2 days (glucose) or 7 days (glycerol/ethanol). For ubiquinone analysis in yeast, cells were grown on appropriately supplemented synthetic minimal medium containing 2% (w/v) d-galactose as an inducer and carbon source. Starter cultures (2 ml) were used to inoculate 40-ml cultures grown at 30°C. Cells were harvested by centrifugation at mid-exponential phase of culture, washed once with 25 ml of water, and resuspended in 1 ml of water. Cells were quantified by absorbance at 600 nm, and the cell numbers were normalized by adjusting the volume of each sample. One ml of each suspension was then transferred to a 10-ml Pyrex tube containing approximately 0.5 ml of 0.5 mm glass beads, spiked with 8.5 nmoles of ubiquinone-10 as an internal standard and vortexed for 90 sec. Samples were then quickly mixed to 2 ml of 95% (vol/vol) ethanol and heated at 70°C for 10 min. The mixture was allowed to cool down, and was then partitioned twice with 5 ml hexane. Hexane layers were combined, evaporated to dryness with gaseous nitrogen, and resuspended in 1 ml of methanol:dichloromethane (10:1). Extracts were analyzed by HPLC on a 5 μm Supelco Discovery C-18 column (250 × 4.6 mm, Sigma-Aldrich) thermostated at 30°C and developed in isocratic mode at a flow rate of 1 ml min−1 with methanol:hexane (95:5, vol/vol). Quinone forms were detected spectrophotometrically at 275 nm. Quinol forms fully reoxidized during the heating step and were quantified as part of the quinone pool. Retention times were 8.6 min (ubiquinone-6), 11.5 min (ubiquinone-7), 15.8 min (ubiquinone-8), 22.1 min (ubiqinone-9), and 31.5 min (ubiquinone-10). For ubiquinone analysis in Arabidopsis, leaf samples (100–130 mg of fresh weight) were spiked with 3.9–8.5 nmoles of ubiquinone-10 and homogenized in 0.4 ml of 95% (vol/vol) ethanol using a 5-ml Pyrex tissue grinder. The grinder was rinsed twice with 0.3 ml of 95% (v/v) ethanol, and washes were combined to the original extract in a 10-ml Pyrex tube containing 0.5 ml of water. The mixture was partitioned twice with 5 ml hexane. Hexane layers were combined, evaporated to dryness with gaseous nitrogen, and resuspended in 0.2 ml of methanol:dichloromethane (10:1, vol/vol). Due to the higher pigment complexity of the Arabidopsis extracts, it was not possible to fully resolve the ubiquinone-9 peak. Quinone forms were therefore converted to their respective quinol counterparts by adding 40 μl of 200 mm NaBH4 prepared in 100% ethanol. Samples were then briefly centrifuged (5 min; 14 000 g) and immediately analyzed by HPLC in isocratic mode at a flow rate of 1 ml min−1 with methanol:hexane (90:10, v/v). Quinol forms were detected spectrophotometrically at 290 nm. Retention times were 9.7 min (ubiquinol-9), 12.3 min (ubiquinol-10), and 17.4 min (ubiquinone-10). For plastoquinone analyses, leaf ethanol extracts were directly analyzed by HPLC in isocratic mode at a flow rate of 1 ml min−1 with methanol:hexane (95:5, vol/vol). Plastoquinone-9 and ubiquinone-10 were monitored spectrophotometrically at 255 and 275 nm, respectively. Non-reoxidized plastoquinol-9 was quantified by fluorescence (290-nm excitation, 330-nm emission). Retention times of plastoquinol-9, plastoquinone-9 and ubiquinone-10 were 12.6 min, 31.5 min and 32.6 min, respectively. For all analyses, data were corrected for recovery, and for re-oxidation in the case of plant samples, of the ubiquinone-10 spikes added to the samples at the beginning of extraction. Typical recovery values were approximately 90% for ubiquinone in yeast, and approximately 70% for ubiquinone and plastoquinone in Arabidopsis. Quinol re-oxidation in NaBH4-treated Arabidopsis samples varied between 7 and 10%.
