!~ABS~! ABSTRACT Ribosome biogenesis is an essential process initiated in the nucleolus. In eukaryotes, multiple ribosome biogenesis factors (RBFs) can be found in the nucleolus, the nucleus and in the cytoplasm. They act in processing, folding and modification of the pre-ribosomal (r)RNAs, incorporation of ribosomal proteins (RPs), export of pre-ribosomal particles to the cytoplasm, and quality control mechanisms. Ribosome biogenesis is best established for Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Plant ortholog assignment to yeast RBFs revealed the absence of about 30% of the yeast RBFs in plants. In turn, few plant specific proteins have been identified by biochemical experiments to act in plant ribosome biogenesis. Nevertheless, a complete inventory of plant RBFs has not been established yet. We analyzed the proteome of the nucleus and nucleolus of Arabidopsis thaliana and the post-translational modifications of these proteins. We identified 1602 proteins in the nucleolar and 2544 proteins in the nuclear fraction with an overlap of 1429 proteins. For a randomly selected set of proteins identified by the proteomic approach we confirmed the localization inferred from the proteomics data by the localization of GFP fusion proteins. We assigned the identified proteins to various complexes and functions and found about 519 plant proteins that have a potential to act as a RBFs, but which have not been experimentally characterized yet. Last, we compared the distribution of RBFs and RPs in the various fractions with the distribution established for yeast.
!~RES~! We established a protocol for nucleolus isolation from cell culture as a prerequisite to analyze the proteome of the according fractions (Fig. 1A; Methods). We separated the cell lysate in cytoplasm and nucleus. Subsequently, the nucleus was further fractionated into nucleus and nucleolus. To judge the quality of the fractionation we used antibodies against several proteins whose localization is established (Fig. 1B). Using antibodies against Toc33 and Toc75, 2 components of the chloroplast translocon, (CITATION) Schleiff E, Becker T.

Subsequently, we determined the proteome of the 3 fractions. All proteins were hydrolysed with trypsin and the peptides labeled during tryptic digestion using 16O and 18O containing water. The peptide pairs exhibiting a differential ratio were interrogated via nano-LC-MS/MS mass spectrometry (MS). MS allows a comparative and relative quantitation by peptide counting of changes in protein abundances between 2 compared samples. We compared the fractions of 16O-labeled cytoplasm vs. 18O-labeled nucleus, 16O-labeled nucleus vs. 18O-labeled cytoplasm, 16O-labeled cytoplasm vs. 18O-labeled nucleolus, 16O-labeled nucleolus vs. 18O-labeled cytoplasm, 16O-labeled nucleus vs. 18O-labeled nucleolus and 16O-labeled nucleolus vs. 18O-labeled nucleus for 3 independent replicates.

Applying the described criteria we identified 2762 different proteins in the 3 fractions (Fig. 2A, B; Table S1). In total, we identified 2544 proteins in the nucleus and 1602 proteins in the nucleolar fraction (Fig. 2B). As expected from the marker analysis (FIB, Fig. 1B), the overlap between the nuclear and nucleolar fraction is large with 1429 proteins. In addition, the overlap of the nuclear and cytoplasmic proteome (1322 proteins) exceeds the overlap between the nucleolar and cytoplasmic proteome (780 proteins), especially as the majority of the latter proteins are present in all 3 fractions. Comparison of all proteins found in here with the 217 proteins previously identified in the nucleolar fraction (Fig. 2C, atNOPdb, left) (CITATION) Pendle AF, Clark GP, Boon R, Lewandowska D, Lam YW, Andersen J, Mann M, Lamond AI, Brown JWS, Shaw PJ.

In total, the proteins represent 133 different yeast RBFs. As expected, all except of one RBF ortholog were found in the nucleus and nucleolus, but 42 are also present in the cytoplasm. Only the ortholog to RLI1 was found exclusively in the cytoplasmic fraction (Table S2), which is consistent with its function in the quality control function of this protein. (CITATION) Karbstein K.

All of the (co-)orthologues assigned to the human RBFs were detected in our proteome (Fig. 2D; right numbers). Again, only one protein (TUFM ortholog) was found exclusively in the cytoplasmic fraction. It is assigned as a translation elongation factor and thus, the functional assignment correlates with the detected localization. In combination, only 246 (co-)orthologues to yeast and human RBFs have been identified, because some of the plant proteins are orthologues of both, yeast and human RBFs. We also investigated the distribution of the RPs in our proteomic data set. We identified 138 of the 239 RP paralogues assigned in A. thaliana (Fig. 2E).

Front Plant Sci 2013; 4:32; PMID:23459595; http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fpls.2013.00032 Worth mentioning, 3 additional RPs (RPL10A, RPS15C and RPL26B) were detected once in one of the fractions analyzed and were, therefore, omitted in our assignment. However, we detected at least one (co-)ortholog of all RPs except RPL29, L31, L39, L40, L41, S29 and S30. Interestingly, studies focusing on the ribosomal proteome had difficulties to detect L29, L39, L41, S29 and S30 as well. (CITATION) Carroll AJ.

Manual inspection revealed that other orthologues to 18 of these proteins have been found in the cytoplasmic fraction, while RPL17, RPL28, RPL36 and RPS28 are only found in the nucleus/nucleolus fraction according to the quality criteria applied (Table S4). It has been discussed that the nucleolus plays an important function in NMD of mRNA. (CITATION) Shaw P, Brown J. Nucleoli: composition, function, and dynamics.

Nucleic Acids Res 2013; 41:6715-28; PMID:23666629; http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkt366 Four of the 6 components involved in this process were indeed observed in the nucleolar and the nuclear fractions (found: Mago, At1g02140; Y14, At1g51510; elF4A3, At3g19760; Barentsz2, At1g15280; not found: Barentsz1, At1g80000; PYM, At1g11400). Thus, based on the proteomic analysis, a function of the nucleolus in NMD appears to be likely. A third complex for which the discovery of proteins was inspected is the spliceosome. Previously, 154 (co-)orthologues to 95 factors were experimentally or bioinformatically identified. (CITATION) Reddy AS, Marquez Y, Kalyna M, Barta A. Complexity of the alternative splicing landscape in plants. Plant Cell 2013; 25:3657-83; PMID:24179125; http://dx.doi.org/10.1105/tpc.113.117523 (CITATION), (CITATION), (CITATION) (CITATION) We observed 86 of these proteins representing 67 different factors; the vast majority as expected in the nucleus (Fig. 2F; Table S5). Six additional proteins (representing co-orthologues to one additional factor) were detected once in one of the 3 fractions (Table S5). In summary, 446 proteins found in either of the fractions and 351 proteins found in the nucleolar fraction have previously been assigned by various means as factor to be involved in ribosome biogenesis, splicing or non-mediated mRNA decay. Within our dataset we also have information about protein acetylation. To judge the specificity at first we analyzed the acetylation of histones, which are known to be exclusively acetylated in the nucleus. Indeed, we observed acetylation of 6 histones exclusively in the nucleus or nucleolus, but not in the cytoplasm (Table 1). In addition, for one Histone superfamily protein we observed an evidence for phosphorylation (Table 1).  [[TABLE]] Next, we inspected the acetylation of other proteins. To ensure the specificity we only considered proteins for which a specific acetylated peptide was observed in at least 2 out of the 3 replicates. Based on this criterion we observed 28 acetylated proteins (Table 2). For only 3 proteins acetylation was observed in the cytoplasmic fraction.  [[TABLE]] We observed 6 acetylated chaperones of the Hsp70 and Hsp90 family. It is known that acetylation of Hsp70 and Hsp90 is a mechanism of chaperone deactivation and in humans is required for autophagosome creation.

AT1G07920 is assigned as ortholog to the human translation elongation factor EF-1 α and AT5G11240 as ortholog to the human WDR43, a protein that was classified as RBF.

Furthermore, we inspected the occurrence of phosphopeptides. However, it needs to be mentioned that neither the purification procedure nor the experimental set up was optimized to protect proteins against dephosphorylation, e.g. by the addition of sodium orthovanadate. It is well known that phosphoproteins are unstable during tissue extraction and protein isolation.

Moreover, we might miss a phosphorylation signal in some cases or fractions, because the phosphoproteins have been degraded during protein isolation. Nevertheless, we detected 30 phosphoproteins. In contrast to acetylation, which was mostly observed for proteins in the nuclear fraction, phosphoproteins were equally abundant in all fractions. Six of the phophoproteins are RPs that have been identified as phosphoproteins before. (CITATION) Carroll AJ, Heazlewood JL, Ito J, Millar AH.

Moreover, phosphorylation of RPs was exclusively identified in the nuclear fraction.  [[TABLE]] Among the identified phosphoproteins in the nucleus and in the cytoplasm are the ATP:ADP antiporter (atNTT2, AT1G15500) and the atNADP-malic enzyme 2 (atNADP; AT5G11670), which are involved in photosynthesis and calvin cycle.

Nucleic Acids Res 2005; 33:633-6; PMID:15608277; http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/nar/gki052 Thus, we analyzed the orthologous groups of the remaining 2316 identified proteins to the human nucleolar proteins. We detected 361 (co-)orthologues in NoPDB from the 2316 A. thaliana proteins (Fig. 2A; Table S6), 63% of them are found in the nucleolus. We found 921 proteins (˜55% proteins found in the nucleolus) that are orthologues to yeast or human proteins not present in NoPDB (Fig. 2A; Table S7, S8). This might reflect the distinct structural and functional properties of the plant nucleolus. (CITATION) Brown JWS, Shaw PJ. Small nucleolar RNAs and pre-rRNA processing in plants.

For 1034 of the 2316 detected A. thaliana proteins no orthologues to human or yeast proteins could be identified (Fig. 2A). Seventy of these “plant specific” proteins were detected in the nucleolar fraction only (Fig. 3A; Table S9). Twenty-five of these 70 proteins are proposed to be involved in transcription, chromatin remodelling, and histone activity or at least in DNA or RNA binding supported in part by experimental evidence (Fig. 3B). In addition, for 22 of the nucleolar “plant specific” proteins a function could not be proposed. Seventeen of the “plant specific” nucleolar proteins are assigned as metabolic enzymes, signal transduction modules or proteases and 6 are assigned as proteins of the cytoskeleton, membranes or other organelles, which is in agreement with the low contamination rate observed by immunodetection (Fig. 1).  [[FIGURE]] In total, 258 “plant specific” proteins are found in both, nucleus and nucleolus (Fig. 3A). 88 of these proteins are of unknown function, while 69 of them are globally categorized as RNA/DNA binding or modifying (Fig. 3C; Table S10). 59 “plant specific” proteins of these 2 compartments are classified as enzymes or signal transduction or protein degradation modules, but for the majority this assignment is not yet supported by experimental evidence (Fig. 3C; gray bar vs. white bar). In addition, 41 of the “plant specific” proteins identified are assigned as proteins of the cytoskeleton or are involved in definition of cellular structures (C&C), as membrane or vesicular transport proteins (M&V), or as proteins of other organelles. However, 7 of 13 C&C proteins are related to microtubule function and 4 in nuclear structure definition, while among the membrane proteins 3 nucleoporins are found. Worth mentioning, most of the proteins of other organelles are membrane proteins of chloroplasts. Analyzing the 191 “plant specific” proteins found in all 3 fractions (Fig. 3D; Table S11) shows that the majority of the proteins is assigned as enzymes or unknown (M&E: 56; unknown: 44), whereas 35 are DNA and RNA binding and processing proteins. As expected, in the pool of “plant specific” proteins identified in all fractions we observed a drastically larger portion of proteins from other organelles (OO, ˜11%) in comparison to the other 2 analyzed proteome sub-pools. In total, we identified 148 “plant specific” proteins of unknown function in the nucleolus, irrespective whether the protein was found in another fraction as well (Fig. 3B-D). Moreover, 68 “plant specific” proteins in the nucleolus are proposed to function in RNA/DNA binding or processing, 35 in signal transduction and 68 “plant specific” proteins in the nucleolus are classified as enzymes. None of these proteins has yet been characterized. By mass spectrometry we identified “plant specific” proteins. We analyzed the subcellular localization of a randomly selected set of these proteins to confirm the identified localization and to justify the prediction of putative RBFs based on their nucleolar identification. We cloned the CDS of selected proteins in a reporter for expression with N-terminal or C-terminal GFP fusion and analysis in A. thaliana protoplasts (Fig. 4A-E). We confirmed that Fibrillarin2 fused to mCherry can be used to monitor nucleolar localization (Fig. 4F). In addition, based on the AT3G22520 detected in the nucleolus by proteomics and AT5G19440 found in all 3 fractions we demonstrate that N- or C-terminal GFP fusion yielded a comparable result and that the protein distribution as judged from the GFP fluorescence is consistent with the proteomic analysis (Fig. 4A). In total, we analyzed 15 proteins (Fig. 4A-E). For additional 6 proteins we observed the same distribution by fluorescence microscopy as by mass spectrometry (Fig. 4B), namely for AT2G19385 a nucleolar localization (panel 1), for AT1G45170 and AT5G14610 a nuclear/nucleolar localization (panel 2 and 3), for AT3G11270 and AT2G25970 a nuclear localization (panel 4 and 5) and for AT4G17720 in the cytosol and nucleus (panel 6). Note, while expression of GFP-AT1G45170 we observed a small portion of GFP only (Fig. 4G), which most likely accounts for the weak cytosolic signal observed.  [[FIGURE]] For two proteins detected in all fractions by proteomic means, we realized a less complex distribution (Fig. 4C). Expression of AT1G14900-GFP yields GFP fluorescence in the nucleus and nucleolus only, while expression of GFP-AT1G70770 yields GFP fluorescence in the cytosol and in the nucleus but not in the nucleolus (Fig. 4D). For three proteins we observed GFP signal in all fractions, while the proteins were not found in all fractions by proteomic means (AT1G29250, nucleolus; AT2G34160, nucleolus; AT3G62560, cytosol and nucleus). Finally, for 2 proteins we found different localizations, while AT3G27280 was found in the nucleus and nucleolus by proteomic means, we realized a cytosolic and nuclear GFP signal (Fig. 4E). However, we noticed a significant portion of GFP in this case, which might account for the cytosolic GFP signal (Fig. 4G). For AT4G32720 we realized a nuclear / nucleolar distribution by GFP fluorescence analysis, while the protein was only detected in the cytosolic fraction (Fig. 4F). Thus, for more than 50% of all analyzed proteins we observed the exact same result by proteome analysis of the fractions and by analysis of the protein distribution in cells by expression of GFP fusion proteins. For about 30% we realized an overlap of the 2 different approaches, because for about 10% the existence in all fractions was not confirmed, while for 20% we found the protein in all fractions by analysis of the distribution of the GFP fusion protein. Only for about 10% we observed a distinct result between GFP fluorescence analysis and proteome determination after fractionation. Considering that GFP fluorescence analysis can also be error prone, we conclude that by large the localization determined by MS analysis is confirmed.

One percent Nonidet-P40 (final concentration) was added to the homogenate and vortexed vigorously. A cushion of 10% sucrose in HNB was laid under the homogenate and centrifuged at 2150 × g (4°C, 10 min). The supernatant contained the cytoplasmic fraction.

Peptide separation was achieved using a linear gradient of buffer B from 5 up to 25% within 35 min. MS data were generated using the Orbitrap Velos MS equipped with a nano-electrospray ion source (PicoTip Emitter, New Objective). After a first survey scan (r = 60,000) MS/MS data were recorded for the 20 highest mass peaks in the linear ion trap at a collision-induced energy of 30%. The exclusion time to reject masses was set to 60 s and the minimal ion signal for MS/MS was 2000. Proteins were initially identified by searching against an A. thaliana specific database (n = 35386) generated from TAIR10 (CITATION) Lamesch P, Berardini TZ, Li D, Swarbreck D, Wilks C, Sasidharan R, Muller R, Dreher K, Alexander DL, Garcia-Hernandez M, et al.

Search parameters were 10 ppm Parent mass tolerance and 0.6 Da for fragment ion mass tolerance. Carbamidomethylation modification of cysteins (+57 amu), methionine oxidation (+16 amu), C-terminal 18O-modification (+2 amu), phosphorylation (+80 amu) and acetylation (+42 amu) were specified as variable modifications. Peptides were annotated on a false positive rate of 0.59% calculated by the Peptide Prophet algorithm. For protein assembling and grouping Trans-Proteomic Pipeline (v4.4.0, Protein Prophet) was used, whereas only proteins with at least 2 significant peptides were considered for identification and Sequest identifications required at least XCorr scores of greater than 2.5 for double and 3.0 for triple charged ion. Additionally, Scaffold (version Scaffold_4.2.0, Proteome Software Inc.) was used to group pairwise comparison and validate MS/MS based peptide and protein identifications. Peptide identifications were accepted if they could be established at greater than 95.0% probability by the Peptide Prophet algorithm with Scaffold delta-mass correction.

Pairwise fractionation measurements were used meaning nucleus-nucleolus, nucleus-cytoplasm and nucleolus-cytoplasm fractions were labeled differently (O16 / O18). For each pair of fractions 6 independent replicates were analyzed, in which the labeling was switched for 3 independent cell culture replicates to exclude a bias by the label. Proteins were identified as described above with search parameters: 10 ppm parent mass tolerance and 1.0 Da for fragment ion mass tolerance. Peptides were annotated on a false positive rate of 0.57% for acetylation modification and a false positive rate of 0.52% for phosphorylation modification calculated by the Peptide Prophet algorithm. Peptide identifications were accepted if the peptide thresholds were greater than 95.0%. Protein identifications were accepted if the protein thresholds were greater than 95.0% and contained at least 2 identified peptides. The replicas, where a modification either acetylation or phosphorylation was observed, was count and written in the tables see result section. To assure an accurate peptide and phosphorylation site assignment, identifications proofed by using a combination of SEQUEST X-Corr score calculation and fragmentation pattern validation (Scaffold, Proteome Software Inc.). Phosphorylated peptides containing incomplete b- or y-ion fragmentation patterns were manually inspected and validated using Excalibur QUAL BROWSER software (Thermo Scientific). Finally, identified and confirmed phosphorylated peptides were cross-checked by using PhosPhAt 4.0 and SwissProt databases for already described phosphorylation sites (see Table S15; S16). Mass spectrometric results were analyzed by ‘Scaffold’ and peptides identified were used for protein identification. (CITATION) Searle BC.

(ii) Each pairwise comparison including 6 replicates we filtered for fractions showing a signal in at least 3 replicates. (iii) Signals of pairwise fractions were compared to exclude false positives due to missing pairwise fraction data.
