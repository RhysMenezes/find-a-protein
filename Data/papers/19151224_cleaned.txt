!~ABS~! Early endosperm development involves a series of rapid nuclear divisions in the absence of cytokinesis; thus, many endosperm mutants reveal genes whose functions are essential for mitosis. This work finds that the endosperm of Arabidopsis thaliana endosperm-defective1 (ede1) mutants never cellularizes, contains a reduced number of enlarged polyploid nuclei, and features an aberrant microtubule cytoskeleton, where the specialized radial microtubule systems and cytokinetic phragmoplasts are absent. Early embryo development is substantially normal, although occasional cytokinesis defects are observed. The EDE1 gene was cloned using a map-based approach and represents the pioneer member of a conserved plant-specific family of genes of previously unknown function. EDE1 is expressed in the endosperm and embryo of developing seeds, and its expression is tightly regulated during cell cycle progression. EDE1 protein accumulates in nuclear caps in premitotic cells, colocalizes along microtubules of the spindle and phragmoplast, and binds microtubules in vitro. We conclude that EDE1 is a novel plant-specific microtubule-associated protein essential for microtubule function during the mitotic and cytokinetic stages that generate the Arabidopsis endosperm and embryo.
!~RES~! A microscopy screen of a collection of wrinkled seed mutants (CITATION) identified the first allele, ede1-1, as defective in seed development. The mutation leads to 66% seed abortion (n = 244) in homozygous ede1-1 siliques, while mature plants showed no other obvious phenotype and were indistinguishable from the wild type. Aborted seeds fall into two categories: brown shrunken seeds, which indicate late abortion (40%), and small white desiccated seeds, indicating early abortion (26%). No aborted seeds were observed (n = 270) in crosses of ede1-1 × wild type and of wild type × ede1-1, confirming that ede1-1 is a recessive mutation. Analysis of Feulgen-stained ede1-1 endosperm at 6 d after pollination (DAP) revealed a dramatically reduced number of enlarged endosperm nuclei that contained multiple oversized nucleoli compared with the wild type (Figures 1A to 1D ). Staining with 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) confirmed that the increased nuclear volume was accompanied by a rise in DNA content. The amount of DNA in each nucleus at 4 DAP, estimated from the intensity of DAPI staining, was more than threefold greater in ede1-1 (373 units per nucleus ±116; n = 7) compared with the wild type (113 units per nucleus ±10; n = 7). The nucleoli from ede1-1 were also >4 times larger than those from the wild type (1357 pixels ± 246; n = 7 and 307 pixels ±33.5; n = 7 respectively). The ede1-1 mutation leads to a range of seed phenotypes, from mild to severe, within a single homozygous ede1-1 silique. In the mild phenotypes, the endosperm contained approximately one-tenth of the number of NCDs in the peripheral endosperm compared with the wild type at equivalent stages of development, and both micropylar and chalazal endosperm had formed (Figures 1A and 1B). In ede1-1 seeds displaying a moderate effect, the NCDs of the central peripheral endosperm were very large and multinucleate (Figure 1C), and the embryo had associated endosperm (see Supplemental Figure 1 online). In the most extreme examples, only one highly stretched NCD containing connected nuclei was present (Figure 1D). Despite the variable number of NCDs, cellularization of ede1-1 endosperm was not observed. [[FIGURE]] To identify the developmental stage at which the endosperm defect first arises in the ede1-1 mutant, we examined mutant and wild-type seed development with Nomarski optics. Up to 2 DAP, ede1-1 seeds were indistinguishable from the wild type. Enlarged mutant nuclei started to be visible from 4 DAP onwards (Figure 1E). At 6 DAP, the mutant endosperm displayed on average between 1 and 10 enlarged nuclei, whereas the wild-type endosperm contained an excess of 100 normal nuclei. An extreme example is shown in Figure 1E, where at 6 DAP, only one nucleus is visible in the mutant endosperm. ede1-1 embryos develop normally up to 8 DAP and at a rate similar to that of the wild type (Figure 1E) and show no obvious morphological defects. Beyond the heart stage of embryo development, seed shrinkage and collapse were observed in the late aborted ede1-1 seeds. The nuclear division defect in ede1-1 endosperm suggested a possible defect in cytoskeletal organization. To evaluate this, developing mutant and wild-type seeds were analyzed by fluorescence microscopy (Figure 2 ). Immunolabeling with antitubulin and counterstaining with DAPI demonstrated that ede1-1 endosperm lacks the organized microtubule arrays typical of wild-type endosperm. In wild-type endosperm, the nuclei of the syncitium are evenly spaced by RMSs (CITATION) that radiate from each nucleus and define the NCDs (Figures 2A and 2B). By contrast, in early (4 DAP) ede1-1 endosperm, only a few enlarged and unevenly spaced nuclei lacking associated microtubule structures are present (Figure 2D). Later in development (6 to 8 DAP), giant ede1-1 endosperm nuclei displayed several enlarged nucleoli, lacked associated RMSs, and failed to cellularize (Figures 2E and 2F). Despite a careful analysis of the mutant and wild type (∼800 ede1-1 and 400 wild-type seeds at 4 to 6 DAP), we never observed chromatin condensation, mitotic spindles, and cytokinetic phragmoplasts in the mutant. By contrast, mitotic figures, such as spindles and phragmoplasts, were observed at a frequency of ∼1 in 20 in wild-type endosperm (Figure 2C), indicating at least a 40-fold decrease in the mitotic index of the ede1-1 mutant endosperm. [[FIGURE]] The EDE1 gene was identified by positional cloning using a population created from a cross between the homozygous ede1-1 mutant and Landsberg erecta (Ler). The mapping revealed that the mutation lies on BAC F6E13, and sequencing of the nonrecombinant region revealed a G-to-A single base transition at the intron1/exon2 boundary in gene At2g44190. The gene is 1925 bp long from the start ATG to the stop codon and consists of six exons (Figure 3A ), defining a 474–amino acid protein with a predicted molecular mass of 53 kD and a calculated pI of 9.8. RT-PCR using RNA purified from young siliques of homozygous ede1-1 and the wild type showed that mRNA from the gene is present in the mutant but is smaller than the wild type (Figure 3C). Cloning and sequencing of the RT-PCR products showed that the mutant uses a cryptic splice site that is 54 bases after the 3′ of the intron1/exon2 boundary (Figure 3B). This results in a small deletion during processing of the mRNA that leaves the reading frame intact but is predicted to code for a protein that is 18–amino acid residues shorter than the wild type and missing the residues between Arg-304 and Gln-321. The ede1-1 mutation was complemented using a binary construct containing the full-length genomic sequence of the wild-type gene At2g44190. Endosperm from mature seeds (n = 284) of 10 independent T2 ede1-1 homozygous plants that were homozygous for the transgene had a wild-type appearance, confirming that At2g44190 encodes the EDE1 protein. [[FIGURE]] A search of the SALK T-DNA insertion mutant collection (CITATION) identified two further EDE1 alleles that have insertions in the first exon and second intron, respectively, and were called ede1-2 and ede1-3 (Figure 3A). Disruption of the EDE1 gene by T-DNA insertion appears to be lethal: we were unable to identify any plants that were homozygous for the insertion from progeny derived from selfing hemizygous ede1-2 and ede1-3 plants. Hemizygous ede1-2 and ede1-3 have siliques containing ∼38% (n = 288) and 36% (n = 471) abnormal seeds, respectively. Of these abnormal seeds, ∼20% aborted early and 16 to 18% aborted late at the heart-torpedo embryo stage. The late-aborting seeds failed to germinate and displayed defects similar to those described for ede1-1 (see Supplemental Figure 2 online). Similar to what was observed in ede1-1 seeds (Figure 1E), embryo development in ede1-2 and ede1-3 proceeds up to at least the heart stage (see Supplemental Figure 3 online). To determine whether ede1-2 and ede1-3 alleles display defects associated with aberrant mitosis or cytokinesis, we examined histochemically stained sections of mutant embryos from globular to heart stage by light microscopy. Enlarged nuclei containing multiple nucleoli and occasional cell wall stubs were observed in mutant embryos (Figure 4 ) in association with the previously described endosperm defects. [[FIGURE]] To determine whether the maternal or paternal sporophytes are implicated in the ede1-3 mutation, we conducted reciprocal crosses between heterozygous (EDE1/ede1-3) and wild-type plants. In a cross between a heterozygous female (EDE1/ede1-3) and a wild-type male (EDE1/EDE1), 20% of the seed aborted at a heart-torpedo stage; while in a cross between a wild-type female (EDE1/EDE1) and a heterozygous male (EDE1/ede1-3), only 4% seed abortion was observed, similar to wild-type values (Table 1 ). In neither case were early aborted seeds observed. These results suggest that the ede1-3 mutant displays incomplete maternal effect seed lethality. Alternatively, but not exclusively, the paternal allele could suppress 60% of the lethality expected in case of maternal effect only. Seed Phenotype of Reciprocal Crosses between Heterozygous ede1-3 and Col-0 Wild-Type Plants Finally, F1 plants with the genotype ede1-1/ede1-2 or ede1-1/ede1-3 have a similar seed phenotype to homozygous ede1-1 plants, indicating that the different mutants belong to the same complementation group and that ede1-2 and ede1-3 are recessive to ede1-1 (Table 2 ). Live and Total Aborted Seeds from Crosses between ede1-1, ede1-2, and ede1-3 Mutant Genotypes. Sequence analysis identified the EDE1 protein as a member of a family of related, plant-specific proteins, all containing the InterPro domain of unknown function DUF566 (InterPro:IPR007573). A BLAST search (CITATION) revealed six similar proteins in Arabidopsis, one of which (At3g60000) shares 60% amino acid sequence identity. Seven similar proteins were identified in Oryza sativa and four in the moss (Physcomitrella patens) (Figure 5A ). Sequence alignments of all EDE1-like proteins revealed that the highest similarity is located at the C-terminal half of the protein, suggesting that important and conserved functional domains exist in this region (Figure 5A). Phylogenetic analysis of the C-terminal sequences of all members of the EDE1 family identified four types, one of which is confined to moss. EDE1, together with At3g60000, At2g24070, At4g30710, and a rice protein (NM_001069314), fall into the same type, suggesting that NM_001069314 could be the ortholog of EDE1 (Figure 5B; see Supplemental Data Set 1 online). [[FIGURE]] Searches of the Chlamydomonas genomic sequence (http://www.chlamy.org/) revealed no significant similarities, and no similar sequences were identified in any bacterial, fungal, or animal genomes, indicating that the EDE1 family is specific to land plants. The developmentally restricted phenotype of the ede1 mutant alleles suggested that expression of the EDE1 gene might be specific to young proliferating tissues and to the reproductive phase. The expression pattern of the EDE1 gene was determined using RT-PCR, and expression was found to be strongest in young siliques (2 to 4 DAP), 4-d-old seedlings, flower buds, and open flowers (Figure 6A ). The expression was weaker in roots and below the detection level in older siliques (8 to 10 DAP) and in mature leaves. This pattern of gene expression was confirmed by analyzing the large number of expression microarray experiments currently available (https://www.genevestigator.ethz.ch), which also shows that the strongest expression of EDE1 occurs in the inflorescence, although expression could also be detected in the shoot apices, cotyledons, and radicles of embryos at globular and heart stages of development. Otherwise, the EDE1 gene is expressed at very low levels in mature tissues. The pattern of gene expression during development was confirmed in transgenic plants containing EDE1 promoter–β-glucuronidase (GUS) constructs. Analysis of 10 independent lines showed that expression of the GUS reporter was detected in the embryo sac in prefertilization ovules (Figure 6B) and in seeds following fertilization. GUS expression occurred in both embryo and endosperm throughout most of the syncytial phase of endosperm development (Figure 6C) but became undetectable in the cellularized endosperm, when cell division had ceased (Figure 6D). Expression was maintained in the embryo up to heart stage (Figure 6D). Because GUS is a stable protein, it cannot provide accurate information on highly dynamic changes in gene expression. We therefore confirmed and extended these observations by mRNA in situ hybridization analysis. Hybridization of an antisense EDE1 probe to sections of floral meristems indicated that the level of expression was strongest in unfertilized ovules (Figures 6E to 6G) and weaker in embryo and endosperm nuclei in developing seeds (Figures 6H and 6I). When CYCLIN B was used as a control probe in similar sections, the signal in endosperm nuclei was comparable to that obtained with EDE1 as a probe. By contrast, the signal in the embryo was much stronger with CYCLIN B than with EDE1 (see Supplemental Figure 4 online). However, the EDE1 signal was not restricted to embryonic tissues per se but could be detected in other actively proliferating tissues, such as young unfertilized ovules (Figure 6G). This produced a spotty pattern in which some cells displayed high levels of signal and neighboring cells did not (Figure 6E), a pattern consistent with the accumulation of mRNA in a cell cycle–dependent manner (CITATION, CITATION). When sections of unfertilized ovules were counterstained with the DNA-specific dye DAPI, to reveal the stage of the cell cycle, the cells containing the strongest EDE1 signal were all in interphase (Figures 6E and 6F). Prophase cells contained only a weak signal, and metaphase cells had no detectable signal. These results are consistent with a G2 phase–specific expression of the EDE1 gene (CITATION). [[FIGURE]] To gain further insight into the pattern of EDE1 expression, we interrogated the Arabidopsis coresponse database (http://csbdb.mpimp-golm.mpg.de/csbdb/dbcor/ath.html) to find those genes that show similar patterns of expression. This resource compiles microarray expression data from numerous experiments and can provide clues to gene function by association with genes of known function. Eighteen from the top 20 genes, whose expression most closely corresponded with EDE1 over a range of experimental conditions, are either known or predicted to be involved in mitosis and cytokinesis (see Supplemental Table 1 online). These include KNOLLE (CITATION) and several cyclins with predicted mitotic function. Notably, two microtubule associated proteins, a homolog of end binding 1 protein (EB1) (CITATION; CITATION) and a mitotic kinesin, NACK1/HINKEL (CITATION), are also among the top 20, along with the chromosomal protein SMC4 (CITATION). Many of these coexpressed genes contain one or more M-specific activator (MSA) elements that are believed to enhance gene expression during G2 and M phase (see Supplemental Table 1 online). Sequence analysis identified two MSA elements in the EDE1 promoter sequence and putative anaphase-promoting complex (APC) target motifs within the EDE1 coding sequence. Moreover, a study to identify genes that are coregulated during the cell cycle in Arabidopsis cell suspension cultures (CITATION) revealed that EDE1 (termed a hypothetical protein in that report) is one of 82 genes that peak in their expression during the G2/M phase of the cell cycle. Our expression studies, together with the tight coresponse of EDE1 with many genes that show transcriptional upregulation during G2/M, strongly suggest that EDE1 expression is highly regulated during the cell cycle. To gain insight into the cellular role of EDE1, we fused the EDE1 genomic sequence with a green fluorescent protein (GFP) reporter gene. The functionality of the GFP-EDE1 fusion protein was demonstrated by expressing it under the EDE1 promoter in homozygous ede1-1 mutant plants, where full complementation was observed in eight out of eight independent transgenic lines (see Supplemental Table 2 online). Although the GFP fusion confirmed that EDE1 was expressed in the endosperm of developing ovules (see Supplemental Figure 5 online), the complexity of the tissue interfered with high-quality imaging. Therefore, we studied the dynamic localization of GFP-EDE1 in cell suspensions. In Arabidopsis cells transiently expressing GFP-EDE1, the GFP signal was associated with spindles and phragmoplasts (see Supplemental Figure 6 online). To test if the association depended on microtubules, we treated Arabidopsis cells expressing GFP-EDE1 with taxol (10 μM) or oryzalin (10 μM), drugs that are specific for the stabilization or destabilization of microtubules, respectively. Oryzalin treatment caused a loss of GFP fluorescence (data not shown), whereas the GFP-EDE1 signal in taxol-treated cells remained fibrillar (see Supplemental Figure 7 online). To examine the dynamics of GFP-EDE1 redistribution during the cell cycle, we stably transformed tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) BY-2 cells with the EDE1 promoter:GFP-EDE1 construct. GFP-EDE1 fluorescence in proliferating transgenic tobacco BY-2 lines was virtually undetectable during interphase, but, at the onset of mitosis, GFP-EDE1 began to accumulate into opposing polar caps in the perinuclear region from which the microtubule arrays radiate toward the cell cortex (Figure 7A ). As cells progressed into mitosis, GFP-EDE1 decorated microtubules of the spindle and spindle poles at metaphase and anaphase (Figures 7B and 7C). In anaphase, a clear gap developed in the central zone of the spindle, and fluorescence was largely restricted to the region between the chromatids and each pole, suggesting that GFP-EDE1 decorates pole-to-chromatid kinetochore microtubules at this stage (Figure 7C). At the anaphase/telophase transition and during telophase, GFP-EDE1 strongly associated with midzone microtubules out of which the phragmoplast emerges (Figures 7D and 7E) and remained associated with the phragmoplast throughout cell plate formation (Figure 7F; see Supplemental Figure 8 online). At the end of cell division, GFP fluorescence was no longer detectable. Notably, GFP-EDE1 was not detected on cortical microtubules, either in the interphase array or the preprophase band. [[FIGURE]] The above observations indicate that the EDE1 protein associates with microtubules during cell division. To further verify this association, we performed costaining experiments using antitubulin antibodies to visualize the microtubules in BY-2 tobacco cells expressing GFP-EDE1. Tubulin colocalized with GFP-EDE1 in a fibrous pattern on mitotic structures (Figure 8A ). Colocalization could not be observed in interphase cells because GFP-EDE1 was not expressed at detectable levels during interphase. Colocalization of EDE1 with tubulin could result either from direct binding of EDE1 to microtubules or from indirect binding via other microtubule-associated proteins. We tested the ability of EDE1 to bind directly to microtubules by an in vitro cosedimentation experiment. In vitro–translated [35S] methionine-labeled EDE1 was incubated with or without taxol-polymerized mammalian brain microtubules. Microtubules were pelleted through a sucrose cushion, and both supernatants and pellets were analyzed by autoradiography. EDE1 was significantly enriched in the tubulin pellet compared with a nonmicrotubule binding control (Figure 8B), indicating that, in vitro, EDE1 binds directly to microtubules. [[FIGURE]]
!~MM~! The ede1-1 mutant originated from a previously described ethyl methanesulphonate–mutagenized M2 population of the Col-2 ecotype (CITATION). The ede1-2 (SALK 047950) and ede1-3 (SALK 048191) alleles in the Col-0 ecotype are T-DNA insertion mutants that were obtained from the Nottingham Arabidopsis Stock Centre (CITATION). Plants were grown in a climate-controlled glasshouse at 20°C day/16°C night with 16 h total lighting between October and March. For aseptic growth, seeds were surface sterilized and plated on Murashige and Skoog medium containing 0.8% (w/v) phytoagar. Primary transformants were selected on plates described but containing either kanamycin (50 mg·L−1) or hygromycin (50 mg·L−1). ede1-1 plants were crossed to plants of the Ler laboratory strain, and 400 F2 progeny were obtained for phenotypic analysis. Genomic DNA was purified using the DNeasy plant mini kit (Qiagen) and used for gene mapping. Mapping of the ede1-1 locus was achieved using the cleaved-amplified polymorphic sequence (CAPS) markers ADHa and UFOa (chromosome I); Ve017a and PhyB/hy3 (II); TSA1a, AtDMC1a, and GAPCa (III) Det 1 (IV); and LFY3a, ASA1a, and R89998a (V). The results showed unambiguously that ede1-1 was linked with Ve017a on the lower arm of chromosome II since none of the plants showing the ede1 phenotype were Ler for Ve017e. Fine mapping using the CAPS markers m429, AthBIO2, ML, AthUIQUE, and 90J19T7 and the simple sequence length polymorphic marker nga 168 showed that the locus lay between AthBIO2 and ML (CITATION). Single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) and InDel markers were identified to further resolve the locus (see Supplemental Table 3 online) and showed that the mutation lay in a 70-kb region between nucleotide 47048 on BAC F6E13 and nucleotide 9510 on BAC F4I1. DNA from the 70-kb nonrecombinant region of ede1-1 containing the mutation was amplified using PCR in 14 5000-bp overlapping fragments and cloned into pGEMT-Easy (Promega). The DNA was sequenced and all differences with the reference sequence were checked by sequencing independently amplified fragments. CAPS and simple sequence length polymorphic markers were used are described at http://www.Arabidopsis.org/, and the PCR analysis was done as previously described (CITATION). The mutation was identified and was confirmed by complementation of the homozygous ede1-1 mutant using a genomic DNA fragment containing the wild-type EDE1 gene, including 5′ and 3′ untranslated regions (Ch2: 18278467 to 18281873). This sequence was excised from binary cosmid clone 53E16 (GeTCID; John Innes Centre) using BamHI and ligated into the BamHI site of the pBIN+ binary vector (CITATION). The pBIN-EDE1 vector was confirmed by sequencing using M13 forward and reverse primers. This clone was introduced into Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain GV3101 (CITATION), and ede1-1 homozygous plants were transformed using the floral dip method (CITATION). The wild-type version of the gene and 5′ regulatory regions were cloned by PCR amplification of genomic DNA. The EDE1 genomic sequence and open reading frame were amplified from Arabidopsis thaliana Col-0 genomic DNA and cDNA using the following primers pairs: EDE1-ATG (5′-ATGGAGGCGAGAATCGGCCGATC-3′) and EDE1-stop (5′-TCAAACAGAAGTTGTGCACTC TTG-3′); or EDE1-5′-GUS (5′-GGCAATCAAATTTCTTCGAA-3′) and EDE1-3-GUS (5′-GTTGCGTCACGCGAAGCTTC-3′), each containing attB1 (5′-GGGGACAAGTTTGTACAAAAAAGCAGGCTAT- 3′) or attB2 (5′-GGGGACCACTTTGTACAAGAAAGCTGGGTC- 3′) recombination sequences (Invitrogen), respectively, as adapter sites at the 5′ end, according to the manufacturer's instructions. The presence of the T-DNA insertions in ede1-2 and ede1-3 was confirmed by PCR using the T-DNA left border primer 5′-TGGTTCACGTAGTGGGCCATCG-3′ and the At2g44190 gene-specific primer EDE1-5, 5′-CTTCTTTGTATCGGCTTGAATCTTCG-3′, for SALK line 047950 (ede1-2) and EDE1-4, 5′-TTTGAAGCGACAACAAGTGCTTCTGC-3′, for SALK line 048191 (ede1-3). For self-crossing analysis, heterozygous plants were allowed to self-pollinate, and progeny seed was analyzed. For reciprocal cross analysis, mutant plants were crossed among themselves (Table 2) or with the wild type as indicated in Table 1. In all cases, progeny seeds were assessed phenotypically in the silique. Expression of GFP-EDE1 driven by the EDE1 promoter was obtained using the Multisite Gateway Three Fragment System (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, a DNA fragment containing 800 bp of the 5′ region of EDE1 leading to the ATG translation start codon was amplified from genomic DNA with the following primers: 5′-GGGGACAACTTTGTATAGAAAAGTTGCAAGAACACACGAAAGAGACCAAAG-3′ and 5′-GGGGACTGCTTTTTTGTACAAACTTGTTCAATCAAATTTCTTCGAAATTGAC-3′and cloned into pDONR P4-P1R. GFP 2.5 was amplified from pDEST02 with the primers 5′-GGGGACAAGTTTGTACAAAAAAGCAGGCTATGAGTAAAGGAGAAGAACTTTTCACTGG-3′ and 5′-GGGGACCACTTTGTACAAGAAAGCTGGGTATTTGTATAGTTCATCCATGCCATGTG -3′ and cloned into pDONR221. The genomic sequence of EDE1 was amplified from genomic DNA with the primers 5′-GGGGACAGCTTTCTTGTACAAAGTGGAAATGGAGGCGAGAATCGGCCGATC-3′ and 5′-GGGGACAACTTTGTATAATAAAGTTGATCAAACAGAAGTTGTGCACTCTTGCTGATG-3′ and cloned into pDONR P2R-P3. All primers contained the respective attB recombination sequences (Invitrogen) as adapter sites at the 5′ end, according to the manufacturer's instructions. LR Clonase mix (Invitrogen; for recombination of attL sites with attR sites) was used to insert each DNA fragment into pMULTISITE GW Vector. Electrocompetent Agrobacterium cells (strain LBA4404.pBBR1MCSvirGN54D) were transformed with EDE1 promoter:GFP-EDE1, and BY-2 tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) and Arabidopsis cells were transformed as previously described (CITATION). Transformed cells were treated with taxol (10 μM; Sigma-Aldrich) or oryzalin (10 μM; Chem Service) for 12 h prior to microscopy observation. Fluorescent and phase-contrast images of 3-d-old BY-2 and Arabidopsis suspension cells were recorded using a ×60 oil immersion objective on a Nikon E600 equipped with a Hamamatsu Orca CCD camera and Metamorph image software. Image stacks were processed using ImageJ (http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/download.html) and figures prepared in Adobe Photoshop PCR products produced with the primers EDE1-5-GUS and EDE1-3-GUS (sequences indicated above) were cloned into the Entry vector pDONR 207 via the BP reaction that allows for recombination between attB and attP sites and to destination vector pBGWFS7 (gift from Ben Trewaskis, Max Planck Institute, Germany) according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). Electrocompetent Agrobacterium cells (strain GV3101) were transformed with the EDE1-GUS plasmids and Arabidopsis plants transformed using the floral dip method (CITATION). Ovules were incubated overnight in GUS-staining solution (80 mM NaPO4, pH 7.0, 0.4 mM K-ferrocyanide, 8 mM EDTA, 0.05% Triton X-100, and 0.8 mg/mL 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-glucuronide) at room temperature. Chlorophyll was then removed with repeated washes with 95% ethanol and samples observed with a Nikon E800 microscope and recorded using Viewfinder 3.0.1 image software (Pixera). For Feulgen staining, siliques at 6 DAP were fixed with ethanol/acetic acid, (3:1 [v/v]) for 16 h and rinsed three times with distilled water for 15 min each. They were treated with 5 n HCl for 1 h, rinsed three times for 5 min with distilled water, and stained with Schiffs Reagent (Sigma-Aldrich) for 3 h. The siliques were rinsed three times with cold (4°C) distilled water and washed in 70% (v/v) and then 95% (v/v) ethanol for 10 min and then three times 10 min in 100% (v/v) ethanol. They were repeatedly washed in 100% (v/v) ethanol for >1 h, until the ethanol remained colorless. The samples were incubated for 1 h in ethanol/LR White (London Resin) (1:1 [v/v]) and 16 h in pure LR White. The siliques were dissected on a slide, in a drop of fresh LR White under a dissecting microscope, and baked at 60°C overnight. The material was viewed using a Leica TCS NT/SP microscope (Leica Microsystems) with ×20 and ×63 water immersion lenses using wide Fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) settings (argon ion laser excitation at 488 nm, emission viewed at 520 nm). For DAPI staining, seeds were excised from siliques and placed in small glass vials with a solution containing 4% (v/v) paraformaldehyde, 25 mM PIPES (pH 6.9, H2SO4), 2.5 mM MgSO4, and 2.5 mM EDTA) and then subjected to vacuum infiltration. The fixative was replaced and the tissue left overnight at 4°C. The fixative was replaced with 0.85% (w/v) saline and the seeds left on ice for 30 min. The seeds were then dehydrated at 4°C with solutions containing increasing amounts of ethanol for 90 min each (50, 70, 85, 95, and 100% [v/v]). The ethanol was replaced with 50% ethanol:50% Histoclear (v/v) for 60 min at room temperature, 100% (v/v) Histoclear for another 60 min at room temperature, and then twice more with 100% Histoclear, at room temperature for 60 min each. Finally, the seeds were placed into 50% Histoclear/50% paraffin wax (v/v) and kept overnight at 50°C. The samples were subsequently kept at 60°C and the wax changed every morning and evening for the following 3 d. A few seeds were placed in a suitably sized warm mold, followed by fresh wax. The wax blocks were sectioned to 8 μm. The sections were dewaxed and stained in the dark with DAPI (1 μM/mL) for 20 to 30 min and then washed with water. Images were taken using a Bio-Rad confocal scanning laser microscope with a ×40 oil immersion lens and analyzed on an Apple Macintosh using the program NIH image (National Institutes of Health). For seed clearing, wild-type and mutant siliques were collected at different stages of development (measured as DAP) and immersed in Carnoy's fixative (3 parts 95% ethanol to 1 part glacial acetic acid [v/v]) overnight at 4°C. After several changes of 100% (v/v) ethanol, siliques were hydrated in ethanol series and finally the material was transferred to water. Seeds were excised from siliques under a dissecting microscope and immersed in Hoyers solution (7.5 g gum Arabic, 100 g chloral hydrate, and 5 mL glycerol in 30 mL water). Cleared seeds were examined with a Nikon Microphot-SA equipped with Nomarski optics and supplied with Nikon Coolpix 990 digital camera. For light microscopy of developing embryos, siliques were fixed in 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde in phosphate buffer (PBS) at room temperature under vacuum for 1 h and then overnight at 4°C. Samples were washed three times with PBS, dehydrated in ethanol series, and gradually infiltrated in LR White resin (Electron Microscopy Sciences), ending with three changes of pure resin. Samples were polymerized for 16 h at 60°C, sectioned at 50-nm thickness on a EMUC6 ultramicrotome (Leica Microsystems), and stained with toluidine blue (Sigma-Aldrich). For endosperm immunofluorescence, siliques were fixed in 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde in microtubule-stabilizing buffer/DMSO (MTSB; 50 mM PIPES, 5 mM EGTA, 5 mM MgCl2, and 5% DMSO, pH 6.7 to 7.0) at room temperature under vacuum for 1 h and then overnight at 4°C, according to CITATION. Fixed siliques were mounted to specimen holders and sectioned at 30 μm with a Vibratome series 1000 (Warner Instruments). Sections of ovules were processed as described in CITATION. Briefly, cell walls were partially digested with 2% (w/v) driselase (Sigma-Aldrich) for 30 min, and the plasma membrane was permeabilized with 1% (v/v) Triton X-100 in 10% (v/v) DMSO-MTSB for 30 min at room temperature. After blocking with 1% (w/v) BSA in MTSB for 1 h at room temperature, antitubulin YOL1/34 (Oxford Biosciences) was diluted 1:50 in 3% (w/v) BSA in MTSB and incubated overnight at 4°C. After washing in MTSB, anti-rat Fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated secondary antibody (Sigma-Aldrich) was used at 1:300 dilution in 3% (w/v) BSA in MTSB. DNA was stained with 1 μg/mL DAPI (Sigma-Aldrich), samples were mounted in Citifluor (Amersham), and confocal laser scanning was performed using a Leica SP2 DM IRB inverted microscope (Leica Microsystems) with a ×60 oil immersion objective. Tobacco BY-2 cells were fixed for 30 min in PME buffer (50 mM PIPES, 5 mM EGTA, and 5 mM MgSO4, pH 7.0) plus 0.025 M sorbitol (PMES), containing 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde and labeled with 1:50 antitubulin YOL1/34, as previously described (CITATION). Images were recorded using a ×60 oil immersion objective on a Nikon E600 equipped with a Hamamatsu Orca CCD camera and Metamorph image software. All image stacks were processed using ImageJ (http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/download.html) and figures prepared in Adobe Photoshop. RNA was isolated from different tissues using the Plant RNeasy extraction kit (Qiagen). One microgram of RNA was treated with 10 units of RNase free DNaseI (Amersham Biosciences) for 10 min at 37°C and reverse transcribed using the Superscript III Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen) and oligo(dT)12-18 according to the manufacturer's instructions. RT-PCR was performed using the following EDE1-specific primers: EDE1-F1101, 5′-TTTGTTGAATGCTTCATTGCGGTTGCC-3′, and EDE1-R1425, 5′-TCAAACAGAAGTTGTGCACTCTTGCTG-3′. The actin gene was used as a control using the following primers: 5′-CGCGAAAAGATGACTCAAATC-3′ and 5′-AGATCCTTTCTGATATCCACG-3′. Tissue was fixed and processed as described by CITATION, with the following modifications: tissue was fixed in ethanol:acetic acid:formalin (50:5:10 [v/v]), the slides were processed in the slide processor InsituPro VS Intavis, including the hybridization step-up to the signal detection, and the signal was developed using Western-Blue Stabilized Substrate. Full-length EDE1 and CYCLIN B were amplified from Arabidopsis seedling cDNA using EDE1-ATG and EDE1-stop primers (indicated above) and CYC-5 (5′-ATGGCGACAGGACCAGTTGTTCATC-3′) and CYC-3 (5′-TCATGGAGCAGATGACATAAGAGAC-3′) primers. The PCR products were cloned into pGEM-T vector (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions. EDE1 and CYCLIN B cDNAs were then amplified from pGEM vectors with universal forward and reverse primers for subsequent transcription with T7 RNAP. PCR reactions were performed with the following cycle: 94°C for 3 min, then 30 cycles of 94°C for 45 s, 55°C for 45 s, and 72°C for 1.5 min, with a final extension of 72°C for 6 min. In vitro transcription was performed in 10-μL reactions for 2 h at 37°C in the presence of digoxigenin-UTP nucleotides (0.35 mM). Hydrolysis was performed immediately in 100 mM carbonate buffer, pH 10.2, at 60°C for 30 min, and products precipitated in 2.5 M ammonium acetate and 3 volumes of absolute ethanol for 1 h at 4°C. Pellets were resuspended in 30 μL TE (100 mM Tris and 10 mM EDTA) buffer. Dilutions (100×) were made in water, and 1 μL of each spotted on nitrocellulose for dot-blot: 30 min in blocking solution (Sigma-Aldrich), 30 min in anti-DIG-alkaline phosphatase (Roche); 5 min wash in TBS (10 mM Tris and 250 mM NaCl); 5 min in AP buffer (100 mM Tris, 100 mM NaCl, pH 9.5, and 50 mM MgCl2), and developed as described above until signal was sufficient. All probes were then diluted 100-fold in hybridization solution (300 mM NaCl, 10 mM Tris, pH 6.8, 10 mM NaH2PO4, 5 mM EDTA, 50% [v/v] formamide, 5% [w/v] dextran sulfate, 0.5 mg/mL tRNA, 1× Denhardt's, and 0.1 mg/mL salmon testis DNA) and maintained stably at −20°C until hybridization. Images were captured with a Nikon E800 microscope and recorded using Viewfinder 3.0.1 image software (Pixera). Microtubules were obtained by incubating 5 mg/mL bovine brain tubulin (Cytoskeleton) in GTB buffer (80 mM PIPES, pH 6.9, 2 mM Mg Cl2, and 0.5 mM EGTA) with 30% (v/v) glycerol, 1 mM GTP, and 20 μM paclitaxel (Sigma-Aldrich) for 40 min at 37°C. Full-length EDE1 cDNA was amplified using the primers EDE1-ATG and EDE1-stop (indicated above) and cloned into the Gateway Entry vector pDONR 207 (Invitrogen) via the BP reaction according to the manufacturer's instructions. Using the LR recombination reaction, EDE1 cDNA was then transferred from pDONR 207 into pDEST14 (Invitrogen) and used for in vitro translation with the T7-TNT rabbit reticulocyte lysate system (Promega). Twenty-five microliters of in vitro–translated [35S] methionine-labeled EDE1 was diluted in 200 μL of GTB buffer containing complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche) and spun at 16,000g for 1 h at 4°C. One hundred microliters of supernatant was incubated with or without 50 μg of microtubules and 20 μM paclitaxel for 30 min at 37°C. The microtubule and EDE1 mixtures were layered over 1 mL of 15% (w/v) sucrose in GTB buffer and spun at 16,000g for 30 min at 4°C. Pellets were analyzed for the presence of radiolabeled EDE1 by SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography. Equal loading of the gel was verified by Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining. A control protein, known not to associate with microtubules (At5g16050), was amplified from cDNA using the primers 5′-GGGGACAAGTTTGTACAAAAAAGCAGGCTATATGTCTTCTGATTCGTCCCGGGAAG-3′ and 5′-GGGGACCACTTTGTACAAGAAAGTGGGTCTCACTGCGAAGGTGGTGGTTGGGC-3′ and used as a control in all experiments. Alignments were performed with ClustalW using default settings (www.ebi.ac.uk/clustalx), and phylogenetic trees were generated using MEGA version 4 (CITATION) with bootstrap values from a minimum of 1000 trials. Protein domains were predicted using ELM (elm.eu.org) and ScanProsite (expasy.org/tools/scanprosite/).
