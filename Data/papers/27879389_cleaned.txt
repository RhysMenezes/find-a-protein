!~ABS~! Most eukaryotic cells target ubiquitinated plasma membrane (PM) proteins for vacuolar degradation in response to environmental and developmental cues. This process involves endosomal sorting complexes required for transport (ESCRT). However, little is known about the cellular mechanisms of ESCRTs in plants. Here, we studied the function of one ESCRT-II component, VPS36, which shows ubiquitin-binding activity and may form a putative ESCRT-II with VPS22 and VPS25 in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). Recessive mutation of the ubiquitously expressed VPS36 causes multiple defects, including delayed embryogenesis, defective root elongation, and limited expansion of cotyledons, and these effects can be complemented by its genomic DNA. Abnormal intracellular compartments containing several membrane transporters, including members of the PIN-FORMEDs, AUXIN RESISTANT 1, and PIP1 families, were found in vps36-1 plants. Employing a genetic approach to cross vps36-1/+ with transgenic plants harboring various fluorescent protein-tagged organelle markers, as well as fluorescent probe and ultrastructural approaches, revealed PM proteins in microsomal fractions from vps36-1 seedlings and demonstrated that VPS36 is critical for forming multivesicular bodies and vacuolar biogenesis for protein degradation. Our study shows that functional VPS36 is essential for a proper endosomal sorting pathway and for vacuolar biogenesis in Arabidopsis.
!~RES~! An in silico forward genetic screen of the SALK Homozygote T-DNA Collection for Arabidopsis T-DNA insertional mutants with only nonhomozygous progeny identified several mutants defective in gametophytic or embryonic development. One mutant carrying a T-DNA insertion in the first exon of Arabidopsis VPS36 (vps36-1; Salk_130246) showed no mature homozygous progeny (Fig. 1A). Among the segregating progeny of vps36-1 heterozygotes (vps36-1/+), only a few miniature seedlings (Fig. 1B) appeared to be vps36-1 homozygotes, as evidenced by no expressed transcript (Fig. 1C; Supplemental Fig. S1A). One-quarter of the vps36-1/+ progeny had germination defects (17.8%) or growth arrest (7.7%), suggesting that vps36-1 is a recessive mutant (Supplemental Table S1). In addition to the first mutant, another allele with the T-DNA inserted in the second intron, vps36-2 (Salk_086881), was identified (Supplemental Fig. S1A). Similar to the vps36-1/+ progeny, one-quarter of the vps36-2/+ progeny appeared abnormal, as shown in Supplemental Table S1. Both homozygous mutants showed seedling lethal phenotypes and died before the emergence of true leaves. All these results suggest that the phenotypes of these lines were specifically disrupted by the T-DNA insertion in VPS36, and vps36-1 was chosen for further characterization in this study. [[FIGURE]] In vps36-1, cotyledon developmental defects in seedlings were widespread, including the absence of the typical jigsaw-puzzle pattern in pavement cells, a lack of guard cells, and the presence of unsealed cell wall stubs between two adjacent cells (Fig. 1D). Mutant seedlings also showed defects in the organization and development of the root apical meristem (Fig. 1E). The seedling growth defects observed in vps36-1 could be complemented by either VPS36 genomic DNA or GFP-fused VPS36 driven by the VPS36 promoter (more than six complementary transformants were obtained in each construct; Supplemental Fig. S1A). Thus, the growth defects found in vps36-1 mutant are indeed caused by the T-DNA disruption in VPS36. Results from RT-PCR (reverse transcription-PCR) and GUS assays using proVPS36:GUS transgenic plants revealed that VPS36 is expressed throughout all tissues and developmental stages, including embryogenesis (Supplemental Fig. S2). However, the failed germination of 17.8% of the vps36-1 seeds implied defective embryogenesis and seed development. Next, we examined embryo development in vps36-1/+ siliques. The total seed numbers were similar between vps36-1/+ and wild-type siliques, but one-quarter of the vps36-1/+ seeds showed an abnormal pale green color (the ratio of green seeds to pale green seeds from vps36-1/+ was 2.92:1, n = 278, P [χ2 test, 3:1] = 0.84; Fig. 2, A and B). Microscopic imaging of developing embryos from vps36-1/+ siliques at the globular, heart, and torpedo stages (Fig. 2, C–E) revealed that 75% developed uniformly up to the heart (Fig. 2D) or torpedo (Fig. 2E) stage, while one-quarter showed impeded development at the transition (26.1% in Fig. 2D) or heart (25% in Fig. 2E) stage. This segregation ratio clearly indicated a recessive mutation of VPS36 leading to retarded embryo development. VPS36 may be essential across multiple growth and developmental processes after the heart stage of embryogenesis. [[FIGURE]] In fungi and metazoans, ESCRT-II consists of VPS22, VPS36, and two VPS25 molecules, forming a Y-shaped structure (CITATION; CITATION). To determine whether VPS36 can form a putative ESCRT-II with VPS22 and VPS25 in Arabidopsis, we used several tagged recombinant proteins–GST-VPS36, 6xHis-VPS22, and 6xHis-VPS25-6xHis–for in vitro protein pull-down assays. Glutathione sepharose beads bound to GST-VPS36 recombinant proteins could more efficiently pull down the recombinant proteins 6xHis-VPS22 (Fig. 3A, left) or 6xHis-VPS25-6xHis (right) than the glutathione S-transferase (GST) control, as revealed by western-blot analysis with His antisera. Thus, VPS36 may interact with VPS22 and VPS25 to form a putative Arabidopsis ESCRT-II complex. In yeast and mammals, VPS36 must bind to and transfer ubiquitinated membrane cargo through its GLUE domain between different ESCRT complexes (CITATION; CITATION). To examine the potential ubiquitin-binding activity of Arabidopsis VPS36, we used ubiquitin agarose as bait for a pull-down assay of the GLUE domain, GST-VPS36ΔGLUE, and GST-VPS36 recombinant proteins, and we found that all of these proteins were more enriched in the ubiquitin agarose than in the GST control (Fig. 3B). These results showed that VPS36 could bind to ubiquitin through the conserved GLUE domain. However, we also found that VPS36ΔGLUE from Arabidopsis, but not VPS36ΔGLUE from yeast, could interact with ubiquitin agarose. These results suggest that the ubiquitin-binding mechanism of VPS36 in Arabidopsis is quite different from that in yeast and mammals, whose VPS36 interacts with ubiquitin through the GLUE domain. [[FIGURE]] In general, VPS36 is composed of two major domains, the GLUE domain for ubiquitin binding and the VPS36 domain for interacting with VPS22 and VPS25. In yeast, VPS36 interacts with ubiquitin through an NZF motif that is absent from the VPS36 proteins in both animals and plants (CITATION). Additionally, the GLUE domain of animal VPS36 binds both phosphoinositides and ubiquitin, and the deletion of GLUE in VPS36 leads to the loss of ubiquitin binding. In Arabidopsis, the GLUE domain has been identified as showing ubiquitin-binding ability; nevertheless, additional ubiquitin-binding motifs may be present in AtVPS36, because the AtVPS36 lacking the GLUE domain still showed ubiquitin affinity (Fig. 3B). Compared to yeast and animal VPS36 proteins, the region between the GLUE and VPS36 domains of AtVPS36 shows less conservation. In addition, AtVPS36 has a longer C terminus than the yeast and animal homologs. This region might be the potential ubiquitin-binding domain in AtVPS36. It will be interesting to identify and characterize these unknown motifs in the near future. Despite these differences, Arabidopsis VPS36 may form a functionally conserved ESCRT-II with its corresponding partners VPS22 and VPS25, exhibiting an evolutionarily conserved ability to bind to its ubiquitinated plasma membrane targets. PM-localized auxin carriers are responsible for the polar flow and the creation of local concentration maxima of auxin to trigger diverse developmental processes, including embryogenesis. At the heart stage of developing embryos, auxin accumulates at the tips of both rudimentary cotyledons and roots, where it begins to regulate further development in a stoichiometric manner (CITATION). These auxin carriers may be the targets of a putative Arabidopsis ESCRT-II. To track the distribution and accumulation of auxin during embryogenesis, we crossed vps36-1/+ plants with plants harboring GFP driven by the DR5 promoter, which is up-regulated by synthetic auxin (CITATION). The self-pollinated vps36-1/+ siliques at the torpedo stage were collected and analyzed. As shown in Figure 4A, most of these embryos (approximately 75%) showed strong GFP signals in both apical and basal tips, where auxin accumulated, similar to wild-type embryos; thereafter, all of them are described as the “control,” as in Figure 4A. Compared to wild-type-like embryos with detectable apical and basal tip-localized auxin, approximately one-quarter of the development-retarded embryos in the same siliques showed impaired polar flow of auxin in rudimentary cotyledons, as reported in a previous analysis (Fig. 2), which suggested that they were vps36-1 homozygotes (vps36-1 in Fig. 4A). [[FIGURE]] To clarify the defective distribution of auxin in vps36-1 embryos, we crossed vps36-1/+ plants with transgenic plants harboring fluorescent-protein-tagged auxin efflux and influx carriers, proPIN1:PIN1-GFP (Fig. 4B) and proAUX1:AUX1-YFP (Fig. 4C). Embryos from transgenic seedlings carrying PIN1-GFP, PIN2-GFP, and AUX1-YFP in the vps36-1/+ background developed similarly to those from vps36-1/+ mutants, which showed 25% abnormal progeny (Supplemental Table S1). After the heart stage, the control embryos showed a restricted accumulation of PIN1-GFP to the primary vascular tissue to mediate both intercellular movement and the local accumulation of auxin (CITATION). After the early torpedo stage, when vascular tissues differentiate and branch out, the PIN1-GFP signals remained restricted to vascular tissues; however, in growth-retarded vps36-1 embryos, PIN1-GFP–labeled vascular tissues expanded all the way up to the rudimentary cotyledons but did not branch out (Fig. 4B). This difference in the distribution of PIN1-GFP may be caused by defects in the development of vascular tissues or by the misexpression of PIN1 in vps36-1 embryos. Moreover, unlike the polarized localization of PIN1-GFP in rudimentary cotyledons in wild type, PIN1-GFP was aberrantly accumulated in intracellular compartments in vps36-1 embryos (Fig. 4B). The expression pattern of the auxin influx carrier AUX1 did not differ substantially between the control and vps36-1 plants. Nevertheless, in vps36-1, AUX1-YFP accumulated in the intracellular compartment of the root cap (Fig. 4C) rather than in the plasma membrane as in the control. The ESCRT-mediated degradation of plasma membrane proteins, such as PIN1 and AUX1, may be impaired in vps36-1 embryos. The marked growth defect in vps36-1 roots indicates that the local auxin accumulation might not persist long after germination. To test this hypothesis, we observed the distribution of GFP driven by the DR5 promoter, and we found it to be up-regulated by auxin in roots of wild-type and vps36-1 seedlings (Fig. 5A). In wild-type seedlings, auxin accumulated in the stem-cell niche, especially at the quiescent center, where it peaked in level, while in vps36-1, the signal significantly accumulated in cells of the columella. The polar transport and accumulation of auxin may be impaired in vps36-1 seedlings. [[FIGURE]] Next, we investigated the expression patterns and subcellular localizations of three auxin transporters, PIN1, PIN2, and AUX1, in the roots of both wild-type and vps36-1 seedlings obtained from crossing vps36-1/+ plants with transgenic plants carrying the constructs. In wild-type seedlings, PIN1-GFP specifically localized to the plasma membrane of the vascular tissue (Fig. 5B). In vps36-1 seedlings, PIN1-GFP showed significant accumulation in the cytosol of the vascular tissue (Fig. 5B). AUX1 is expressed in the plasma membrane of protophloem, columella, lateral root cap, and epidermal cells in the Arabidopsis root tip (CITATION). AUX1-YFP was mislocalized to the intracellular compartments in the roots of vps36-1 seedlings (Fig. 5C). Moreover, the aquaporin PIP1 was selected for testing whether auxin-independent membrane proteins accumulate in intracellular compartments, similar to PIN1 and AUX1 in vps36-1 (CITATION). Similar to PIN1 and AUX1, the aberrant accumulation of PIP1 in vps36-1 was observed (Supplemental Fig. S3), suggesting that the defects caused by vps36-1 in membrane protein trafficking are not restricted to auxin-related membrane proteins. The ESCRT machinery-mediated recycling/degradation process may be critical for the vacuolar degradation of these membrane proteins. Indeed, the abnormal accumulation of these auxin-relative carriers in the cytoplasm of vps36-1 root tips may alter the distribution of auxin, thereby resulting in defective root development in vps36-1 seedlings (Fig. 1E). We observed the intracellular compartments of PIN1-GFP and AUX1-YFP in the root tips of vps36-1 seedlings. PIN2 is known to mainly localize to the plasma membrane at the basal side of cortical cells and at the apical side of epidermal cells, and the latter is more convenient for tracking the dynamic endomembrane trafficking (CITATION). Next, we used PIN2-GFP as a tracking cargo of ESCRT to clarify the trafficking defects in vps36-1. As with the aberrant aggregation of PIN1-GFP, AUX1-YFP, and PIN2-GFP in cytosol, PIP1-GFP accumulated in intracellular compartments in vps36-1. To identify endomembrane compartments with PIN2-GFP accumulations, we crossed vps36-1/+ plants carrying PIN2-GFP with wild-type plants expressing the early endosome/trans-Golgi network (EE/TGN) marker red fluorescent protein (RFP)-tagged VTI12 or the LE/PVC marker RFP-tagged RHA1 (CITATION) and examined progeny carrying PIN2-GFP and either VTI12-RFP or RHA1-RFP under wild-type and vps36-1 genetic backgrounds. In wild-type root tips, PIN2-GFP and VTI12-RFP or RHA1-RFP localized to the plasma membrane and the EE/TGN or LE/PVC, respectively (Fig. 6, A and B). However, in vps36-1, cytosolic PIN2-GFP partially colocalized with either VTI12-RFP or RHA1-RFP (Fig. 6, A and B). To quantify the colocalization results, the linear Pearson (rp) and nonlinear Spearman’s rank (rs) correlation coefficient (PSC) for the pixels representing the fluorescence signals in both the GFP and RFP channels was used to assess the colocalization (CITATION). The PSC calculation showed that compared to the wild type, vps36-1 exhibited higher levels of colocalization of PIN2-GFP with both VTI12-RFP and RHA1-RFP, indicating that PIN2-GFP accumulates in both the EE/TGN and the LE/PVC. Moreover, in vps36-1, PIN2-GFP accumulated less in the VTI12-RFP–labeled EE/TGN (rp = 0.20 and rs = 0.18) than in the RHA1-RFP–labeled LE/PVC (rp = 0.43 and rs = 0.39), suggesting differential accumulation of PIN2-GFP in EE/TGN and LE/PVC. The pronounced accumulation of PIN2-GFP in the EE/TGN suggests that VPS36 participates in LE/PVC formation from the EE/TGN. Moreover, the accumulation of PIN2-GFP predominantly in the LE/PVC compartment suggests that VPS36 is essential for PIN2-GFP targeting from LE/PVC to the vacuole for degradation. [[FIGURE]] VPS36 is a component of the ESCRT-II complex that is responsible for targeting proteins to the vacuole. The accumulation of auxin carriers within the EE/TGN and LE/PVC may result from a defective vacuolar targeting pathway. To test this hypothesis, both wild-type and vps36-1 root tips stained with FM4-64 for 4 h were used to track the trafficking of FM4-64 from endosomes to vacuoles. (Fig. 6C). In the wild type, FM4-64–labeled tonoplasts were observed within epidermal cells, but in vps36-1, FM4-64 signals remained punctate foci and colocalized well with PIN2-GFP–tagged LE/PVC compartments (rp = 0.71 and rs = 0.79). A functional ESCRT-II complex may be critical for vacuolar targeting and probably for vacuolar biogenesis. We further investigated the findings of a blocked vacuolar targeting pathway in vps36-1 and the absence of FM4-64–labeled tonoplasts in vps36-1 roots. The maturation of a lytic vacuole relies on the transport of tonoplast and vacuolar resident proteins from the EE/TGN to the vacuole through the PVC/MVB (CITATION; CITATION). As shown in the above results, the targeting of PIN2-GFP to the vacuole is impaired in vps36-1 plants. To visualize vacuolar targeting in the roots, we introduced an RFP-tagged tonoplast-specific syntaxin protein, Vesicle Associated Membrane Protein 711 (VAMP711; CITATION), into vps36-1/+ plants. Wild-type (but not vps36-1) root cells showed many typical VAMP711-RFP–decorated vacuoles (Fig. 7A, top); moreover, vps36-1 cells showed intracellular PIN2-GFP overlapping with VAMP711-RFP (rp = 0.39 and rs = 0.48; Fig. 7A, middle). The magnified images obtained from thin optical sections clarified the details of the fragmented vacuoles (rp = 0.36 and rs = 0.34; Fig. 7A, bottom). Almost all the small and aggregated circular compartments with VAMP711-RFP–decorated contours strongly colocalized with PIN2-GFP. [[FIGURE]] Next, we investigated the cell ultrastructure using transmission electronic microscopy. In contrast with wild-type cells, which contain typical large lytic vacuoles, vps36-1 root tip cells showed many small and aggregated compartments but no typical vacuole (Fig. 7B). Moreover, lytic vacuoles, indicated by labeling with LysoTracker Red, were less abundant in vps36-1 (Supplemental Fig. S4). Additionally, we examined the morphologic features of protein storage vacuoles (PSVs) in the maturing seeds of vps36-1/+ siliques. Of the 59 embryos examined, 44 showed typical large PSVs, while the remainder showed only numerous small PSVs (Fig. 7C), demonstrating Mendelian segregation (1:3). In vps36-1 plants, the presence of abnormal lytic vacuoles in the root and abnormal storage vacuoles in mature embryos indicated that VPS36 is essential for vacuolar biogenesis. ESCRT-II is required for sorting cargo and recruiting ESCRT-III to indentation sites for the formation of ILVs and for the maturation of ILVs into MVBs (CITATION). Ultrastructural observations of epidermal cells revealed typical and 200- to 300-nm–diameter MVBs with ILVs in wild-type cells but again no typical MVBs in vps36-1; instead, vps36-1 cells showed many membrane compartments similar in size to wild-type MVBs but with one or no ILVs (Fig. 8A). To further confirm the identity of the MVBs, we used an antibody for the MVB marker RHA1 (CITATION) for an immunogold study. Unlike wild-type cells, with RHA1 localized on the membrane of typical MVBs, in vps36-1 cells, the RHA1-labeled membranous compartments did not contain typical ILVs (Fig. 8B). The mean number of ILVs was 7.7 ± 2.78 for wild type and 0.45 ± 0.72 for vps36-1 MVBs. This finding is consistent with the accumulation of PIN2-GFP in the membranous compartments of vps36-1 cells (Fig. 7B). Therefore, we conclude that VPS36 contributes to ILV formation and to the subsequent sequestering of membrane proteins from the membrane to ILVs. [[FIGURE]] The primary function of the ESCRT pathway is targeting plasma membrane proteins toward the vacuole for degradation. Because VPS36 can bind monoubiquitin in vitro (Fig. 3B) and is involved in targeting several auxin carriers to vacuoles, vps36-1 seedlings might show significant accumulation of ubiquitinated membrane proteins. Fractionation revealed only small amounts of ubiquitinated membrane proteins in crude extracts and in supernatant and microsomal membrane fractions of wild-type seedlings (Fig. 9). In vps36-1 seedlings, the amount of ubiquitinated proteins was comparable between the crude extract and the soluble fraction but increased in the microsomal membrane fraction. Moreover, western blotting with anti-PIN1 serum showed an additional band that was larger by approximately 10 kD in vps36-1 but not in wild type, suggesting that ubiquitinated PIN1 is present in vps36-1 (Supplemental Fig. S5). Thus, VPS36 plays important roles in the formation of functional MVBs and in the degradation of ubiquitinated membrane proteins in vacuoles. [[FIGURE]] To evaluate the subcellular localization of VPS36 in vivo, we crossed VPS36-GFP transgenic plants with plants expressing VTI12-RFP and RHA1-RFP. Notably, most of the VPS36-GFP localized to the plasma membrane (Supplemental Fig. S6). In comparison with VTI12-RFP and RHA1-RFP, VPS36-GFP showed very few puncta. Instead of good colocalization with VTI12-RFP and RHA1-RFP, the punctate signals of VPS36 were either adjacent to or partially overlapping with these proteins, suggesting that VPS36 associates with the specific domain of the EE/TGN or LE/PVC where ESCRT occurs rather than occupying the entire membrane of the EE/TGN or the LE/PVC.
!~MM~! All the plant materials, including transgenic plants and mutants, correspond to the Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) ecotype Col-0. After stratification for 3 d, the seeds were germinated on soil or .50× Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium containing 1% Suc and 1% agar (pH 5.7). Seeds and plants were grown in chambers under a 16-h photoperiod at 22°C. The mutant lines vps36-1 (Salk_130246) and vps36-2 (Salk_086881) were obtained from the Arabidopsis Biological Resource Center at Ohio University. The transgenic lines proDR5:GFP, proPIN1:PIN1-GFP (CITATION), proPIN2:PIN2-GFP (CITATION), and proAUX1:AUX1-GFP116 (CITATION) were used in this study. Transgenic plants expressing the fluorescent LE/PVC protein RHA1 (WAVE 7), the TGN/EE v-SNARE VTI12 (WAVE 139), the tonoplast protein VAMP711 (WAVE13), or the plasma membrane aquaporin PIP1 (WAVE 138) were obtained from the European Arabidopsis Stock Center (CITATION). All the primer sets for RT-PCR and PCR are listed in Supplemental Table S2. Total RNA was extracted from plant tissues using the Plant Total RNA Miniprep Purification kit (GeneMark) and treated with the TURBO DNA-free kit (Applied Biosystems) to remove DNA contamination. RT-PCR was performed to validate the expression of At VPS36 in both wild-type and vps36-1 seedlings as previously described (CITATION). The open reading frames for Arabidopsis VPS36, VPS22, and VPS25 were amplified by PCR from seedling cDNA. The 5.1-kb full-length genomic DNA fragment and 4.3-kb stretch of genomic DNA without gene sequences downstream of VPS36 were amplified by PCR from genomic DNA. To complement the vps36-1 mutant, 5.1-kb and 4.3-kb DNA fragments of VPS36 were ligated into the pPZP221 vector (VPS36-gDNA) and pPZP221GFP vector (VPS36-GFP), respectively. After verification of the DNA sequence, the construct was introduced into Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain GV3101. Arabidopsis plants of vps36-1/+ were transfected with Agrobacterium via the floral dip method described by CITATION. For the in vitro protein interaction assay, the ORF and the ORF without the GLUE domain of VPS36 were ligated into the pGEX4T-1 vector (GE Healthcare) to obtain recombinant GST-VPS36 protein, and the open reading frames of VPS22 and VPS25 were ligated into the pET28a and pET30a vectors (Novagen) to obtain 6xHis-VPS22 and 6xHis-VPS25-6xHis recombinant proteins, respectively. Recombinant GST-VPS36, 6xHis-VPS22, and 6xHis-VPS25-6xHis proteins were produced in an Escherichia coli expression system and purified with Glutathione Sepharose 4B beads (GE Healthcare) and with Talon His-tag purification beads (Clontech). Recombinant proteins were dialyzed with PBS (pH 7.5) and 0.1% Triton X-100 buffer for further assays. Approximately 83 pg each of GST and GST-VPS36 protein were separately bound to 40 µL of glutathione sepharose 4B beads, which were incubated with 83 pg of 6xHis-VPS22 or 6xHis-VPS25-6xHis. After three washes with 1× PBS buffer, the beads were eluted with 30 µL of 10 mm glutathione in 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0; added to 10 µL of 4× SDS sample buffer containing 40% glycerol, 240 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 8% SDS, 0.04% bromophenol blue, and 5% β-mercaptoethanol; and then boiled for 5 min. Approximately 12 µL of each boiled sample was used for SDS-PAGE and protein gel-blot analysis with the anti-His antibody (Signalway Antibodies). The blots were visualized using the SuperSignal West Pico Chemiluminescent substrate (Thermo). To test the ubiquitin-binding properties of GST-VPS36 and GST-VPS36ΔGLUE, 35 µL of ubiquitin agarose (Sigma) was incubated with 25 µg each of GST, GST-VPS36, and GST-VPS36ΔGLUE in assay buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.2; 125 mm potassium acetate; 2.5 mm magnesium acetate; 5 mm EGTA; 1 mm DTT; 10% fetal bovine serum; and 0.1% Igepal), and the beads were washed with washing buffer four times, mixed with 35 µL of 4× SDS sample buffer, and boiled for 5 min. Samples of approximately 15 µL were used for SDS-PAGE and protein gel-blot analyses with the anti-GST antibody (Bioman). In both experiments, 1/20 beads were used as the input control before washing. Chemical treatments involved incubating 5-d-old seedlings in liquid .50× MS medium containing 1% Suc and 4 µm FM4-64 (Invitrogen, 1 mm stock in deionized and distilled water), 10 µm propidium iodide (Sigma, 10 mm stock in water), and 4 µm LysoTracker Red (Invitrogen, 1 mm in DMSO). To visualize the tonoplasts and lytic vacuoles, the seedlings were treated with FM4-64 for 4 h and with LysoTracker Red for 1 h. To observe the embryos, fresh samples were isolated with sharp forceps from immature siliques under a microscope (Nikon, SMZ645) and then mounted in 5% glycerol for laser-scanning confocal microscopy (Zeiss, LSM510) to record fluorescent images. To visualize fluorescence, a 405-nm Blue Diode laser, 543-nm HeNe laser, and 488-nm Argon laser were used to excite the autofluorescence of PSVs, red fluorescent protein (RFP), and propidium iodide/GFP/yellow fluorescent protein (YFP)/FM4-64/chlorophyll, respectively. Fluorescence emitted from PSVs/GFP/YFP, propidium iodide/RFP/FM4-64, and chlorophyll were recorded using 500- to 530-, 565- to 615-, and 650- to 710-nm band-pass filters, respectively. For colocalization analysis, the PSC colocalization plug-in (CITATION) for ImageJ was used to calculate the rp and rs of red and green fluorescent signals. Cytosolic areas without plasma membranous regions were masked using the ImageJ freehand selection tool. At least 30 individual cells for each experiment were chosen for calculation, and the background noise was set to 10. Roots were collected from 3-d-old seedlings and frozen in a high-pressure freezer (Leica EM PACT2) at 2,000 to 2,050 bars. Freeze substitution was performed in anhydrous acetone medium containing 1% OsO4 and 0.1% UA using an automatized Leica EM AFS2 system. Samples were successively kept at −85°C for 3 d, −60°C for 1 d, −20°C for 1 d, and 0°C for 1 d, after which the temperature was increased to room temperature. Spurr resins were used for infiltration and embedding. Ultrathin sections of 70 to 90 nm were cut using a Reichert Ultracut S or a Leica EM UC6 microtome (Leica) and then collected on 100-mesh copper grids. The sections were stained with 5% uranyl acetate in 50% methanol for 10 min and 0.4% lead citrate for 4 min. The sections were observed under a Philips CM 100 Transmission Electron Microscope at 80 KV, and the images were obtained using a Gatan Orius CCD camera. For immunogold labeling, LR Gold resin was used for infiltration, and polymerization occurred under UV light. Ultrathin sections of 90 to 120 nm were cut using a Reichert Ultracut S or Leica EM UC6 microtome (Leica) and collected on 100-mesh nickel grids, which were floated on TBS for 15 min and then on TBS and 1% bovine serum albumin for 15 min. The grids were incubated with mCherry monoclonal antibody (Clontech) (diluted 5× in TBS and 1% bovine serum albumin) for 1 h. After being washed four times with TBS, the grids were floated on an excess amount (1:20 dilution) of 12 nm colloidal Donkey antimouse IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch) at room temperature for 1 h. Then, the grids were washed sequentially with three droplets of TBS and then three times with ddH2O. After immunogold labeling, the sections were stained with 5% uranyl acetate for 10 min and 0.4% lead citrate for 6 min. The sections were observed under a Philips CM 100 Transmission Electron Microscope at 80 KV, and the images were obtained using a Gatan Orius CCD camera. Five-day-old seedlings were homogenized in 3 mL of extraction buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0; 150 mm NaCl; 10 mm EDTA; 10% glycerol; 2% protease inhibitor cocktail [P9599; Sigma-Aldrich]; 10 μg/mL chymostatin; and 2 μg/mL aprotinin) per gram of fresh weight. Cellular debris was removed by spinning the samples twice for 10 min each at 3,300 g and 4°C. The microsomal and cytosolic fractions were isolated by centrifugation at 100,000 g for 1 h at 4°C. Protein immunoblotting analyses used rabbit anti-ubiquitin serum (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), mouse monoclonal antiα-tubulin (Sigma-Aldrich), antiγ-TIP (CITATION), and mouse anti-PIN1 serum (CITATION) kindly provided by Dr. Klaus Palme. The blots were visualized as described above.
