!~ABS~! Xylans constitute the major non-cellulosic component of plant biomass. Xylan biosynthesis is particularly pronounced in cells with secondary walls, implying that the synthesis network consists of a set of highly expressed genes in such cells. To improve the understanding of xylan biosynthesis, we performed a comparative analysis of co-expression networks between Arabidopsis and rice as reference species with different wall types. Many co-expressed genes were represented by orthologs in both species, which implies common biological features, while some gene families were only found in one of the species, and therefore likely to be related to differences in their cell walls. To predict the subcellular location of the identified proteins, we developed a new method, PFANTOM (plant protein family information-based predictor for endomembrane), which was shown to perform better for proteins in the endomembrane system than other available prediction methods. Based on the combined approach of co-expression and predicted cellular localization, we propose a model for Arabidopsis and rice xylan synthesis in the Golgi apparatus and signaling from plasma membrane to nucleus for secondary cell wall differentiation. As an experimental validation of the model, we show that an Arabidopsis mutant in the PGSIP1 gene encoding one of the Golgi localized candidate proteins has a highly decreased content of glucuronic acid in secondary cell walls and substantially reduced xylan glucuronosyltransferase activity.
!~RES~! In Arabidopsis, genes IRX9 (At2g37090), IRX14 (At4g36890), and IRX10 (At1g27440) are members of the GT43A, GT43B and GT47D subfamilies. The nomenclature used here for the different clades in GT43 and GT47 is according to Arabidopsis [pone.0015481-Li1] and Brachypodium [pone.0015481-The1] studies and differs from that used to designate poplar genes [pone.0015481-Aspeborg1]. These IRX genes are all expressed in tissues with secondary wall growth and are involved in xylan backbone synthesis [pone.0015481-Brown2], [pone.0015481-Brown3]. To view the correlation of their expression patterns across many microarray experiments, we performed a scatter plot analysis using CoexViewer based on the 237 data sets related to developmental series in the ATTED-II database ([pone.0015481.s001]) [pone.0015481-Kinoshita1]. Scatter plots of pairwise combinations of the three genes showed very similar patterns and strongly correlated expression, whereas the negative control RALF gene (At4g15800), which is mainly expressed in tissues with primary wall growth (e.g. rosette leaf), did not show any correlation with IRX9 expression. To identify other candidate genes likely to be involved in xylan accumulation, we used the CoexSearch tool available at ATTED-II, which uses MR for evaluation of the correlation between two different gene expressions. [pone.0015481.s004] shows the 300 most highly co-expressed Arabidopsis genes obtained for each of the three baits, IRX9, IRX14, and IRX10. Each co-expression list included the three bait genes as strongly co-expressed genes (low MR), and many genes were shared between the three sets of 300 genes, with a total of 124 genes (ca. 23%) shared amongst all three data sets ([pone.0015481.s005]; [pone-0015481-g001]). (A, B) Venn diagrams of the co-expressed genes with each of the three individual baits from Arabidopsis (A) and rice (B). (C, D) Expression profiles of the 25 genes that most closely match with the baits (thick lines). To confirm co-regulation, the transcriptional expression pattern of the top 25 shared genes of the 3-way intersection from Arabidopsis (A) and rice (B) is plotted. The y-axes show relative gene expression values in base-2 logarithm against the average expression levels of each gene. The significance of this tight linkage amongst the three genes was further examined by analyzing other members of the Arabidopsis GT43 (IRX9-L and IRX14-L) and GT47D (F8H, FRA8 and IRX10-L) families [pone.0015481-Wu1]. The maximum MR range for the 300th gene had weaker values ranging from 400 to 600 (except FRA8) when compared to co-expression sets for IRX9, IRX10 and IRX14 where the maximum MR was less than 400 ([pone-0015481-t001]). Surprisingly, Arabidopsis FRA8, which appears to be involved in forming the oligosaccharide at the reducing end of xylan, did not tightly co-express with IRX9, IRX10 or IRX14. FRA8 produced a tight network with an MR<192.8 for the 300th most highly co-expressed genes ([pone-0015481-t001]), but this network did not overlap considerably with the network defined by xylan backbone synthesis genes IRX9, IRX10 and IRX14. Furthermore, the FRA8 network did not include the two other known genes implicated in synthesis of the oligosaccharide, i.e. IRX8 and PARVUS [pone.0015481-Pea1], [pone.0015481-Brown2] while both these genes were co-expressed with IRX9/IRX10/IRX14 genes. The values signify the MR of each of the 300th co-expressed genes with GT43 and GT47D members. Thus, the other 299 co-expressed genes have lower MR values. Low values signify highly correlated expression patterns. The genes shown in bold were used as baits for the final comparative co-expression analysis. The MRs for all genes are listed in [pone.0015481.s004] and [pone.0015481.s006]. To gain a better understanding of the similarities and difference between xylan gene networks in Arabidopsis and in grasses, we also investigated gene networks in rice. Rice has ten and seven genes belonging to the GT43 and GT47D families, respectively ([pone-0015481-t001]). Phylogenic analysis clearly separated the ten GT43 and seven GT47D genes into distinct clades, with six genes in the IRX10/IRX10-L clade, one gene in the FRA8/F8H clade, eight genes in the IRX9/IRX9-L clade, and two genes in the IRX14/IRX14-L clade ([pone-0015481-g002]). We examined the expression of the rice GT43 and GT47D genes in different developmental stages using rice Affymetrix DNA array GSE6893 data [pone.0015481-Jain1]. Interestingly, the expression patterns could be clearly defined into two distinct groups ([pone-0015481-g002]). One type of expression profile was strongly dependent on tissue development stage and had high expression levels in tissues associated with secondary wall deposition. The other type of expression profile had relatively constant expression levels. For simplicity, we designate these two patterns ‘mountain type’ and ‘flat type’ expression, based on the appearance in [pone-0015481-g002]. Most of the genes showing ‘mountain type’ had low range of maximum MR for the 300th gene ([pone-0015481-g002], [pone-0015481-t001]). The high expression level in tissues with secondary wall formation and the strong co-expression indicate that the ‘mountain type’ genes are the likely homologs implicated in xylan biosynthesis in secondary walls, and hence the functional orthologs of the three Arabidopsis IRX genes used for the analysis above. (A) Phylogenic relationship of rice and Arabidopsis genes. Numbers at branches indicate bootstrap values from 500 trials. Phylogenetic tree was built by neighboring-joining method using ClustalW. The IRX10 and FRA8 genes in GT47D, the IRX9 and IRX14 genes in GT43, and their rice orthologues are clearly separated into distinct clades. (B) The ‘Mountain type’ expression pattern of the genes showing MR<280 for the 300 most highly co-expressed genes (upper panel). The ‘Flat type’ expression pattern of the genes which showed MR>280 or had no co-expression data available in ATTED-II (lower panel). Os01g0926700 is included in the mountain type because it has a similar profile, although no co-expression data are available for this gene in ATTED-II. The red and blue arrowheads show the genes used as baits for the final comparative co-expression analysis. The y-axes show raw expression values from rice Affymetrix DNA array GSE6893 data [pone.0015481-Jain1]. The x-axes show tissue type: R; Root_7d_seedling, ML; Mature_leaf, YL; Young_leaf, P1; Young_inflorescence_P1, P2-P6, Inflorescence stage P2 to P6; S1-S5, Seed stage S1 to S5. To select the best rice candidate genes for co-expression analysis we identified the IRX9, IRX10 and IRX14 homologs that fulfilled the following criteria: 1) ‘mountain-type’ expression profile ([pone-0015481-g002]), 2) lowest maximum MR in the 300 most highly co-expressed genes and 3) maximum number of shared genes. We selected the IRX9 ortholog designated ‘OsGT43A’, IRX14 ortholog designated ‘OsGT43B’, and IRX10 ortholog designated ‘OsGT47D’ and used them as baits for co-expression analysis at ATTED-II ([pone-0015481-t001], [pone.0015481.s006]). A large number of shared genes were observed in the pairwise combinations ([pone-0015481-g001]) with OsGT47D-OsGT43B (165 genes), OsGT47D-OsGT43A (121 genes), and OsGT43A-OsGT43B (123 genes). Combining the three genes, 83 (ca. 14%) of the 300 highest ranked genes were shared ([pone.0015481.s007]). These genes included well-known genes such as BC1 encoding COBL4 and cellulose synthase genes OsCesA4, OsCesA7 and OsCesA9, which are involved in secondary wall synthesis [pone.0015481-Li2], [pone.0015481-Tanaka1]. [pone-0015481-g001] (C and D) illustrates the transcriptional co-regulation of the top 25 shared genes for both species. Knowledge of both co-expression of genes and sub-cellular localization of the corresponding proteins contribute to our understanding of protein function and putative interactions. To date, existing prediction algorithms have been unable to reliably predict localization to the endomembrane system in plants. For other eukaryotes, the pTARGET database employing a genome wide prediction method based on location-specific functional domains currently provides the best prediction for subcellular location in the endomembrane systems [pone.0015481-Guda1]. Inspired by this technique we developed a predictor that utilizes Protein functional domain information (Pfam) [pone.0015481-Bateman1] to predict plant sub-cellular localization. The prediction algorithm required a Pfam training set to establish the baseline distribution of the Pfam domains across multiple subcellular locations. The most comprehensive source of subcellular localization data was obtained from the AmiGO database (http://amigo.geneontology.org). To further improve the robustness of the training set, only 2740 experimentally evidenced (i.e. associated with the ‘IDA’ tag) entries were selected from the 5077 Arabidopsis proteins found in this database. This experimental AmiGO data set was further segmented into groups based upon the subcellular localization associated with the annotation, and Pfam domain information retrieved for each protein. This analysis resulted in data sets that map any given Pfam domain to an experimentally observed subcellular localization. In contrast to pTARGET, the developed prediction algorithm was modified to allow for more than one Pfam domain to contribute to the determination of localization. The pTARGET algorithm bases predictions upon Pfam domains that are uniquely located in specific subcellular compartments. In Arabidopsis, such a method would lead to, at best, 50% of the proteins being correctly localized. By accepting domains that are distributed across different localizations, all loci with Pfam domains can be identified. The trade-off to this method is that the algorithmic detection can become overly broad, and the specificity of the algorithm is lowered. The efficacy of the algorithm is dictated by the size of the training set, and the number of individual Pfam domains that are found in each subcellular compartment ([pone.0015481.s008]). [pone.0015481.s009] can be used for the Pfam-based prediction tool. Subcellular localization prediction using [pone.0015481.s009] are performed by finding Pfam domain of a given target protein. For example, a bHLH protein (AT5G48560) has a PF00010 domain and the highest prediction score for PF00010 is 80.9% for nuclear localization. On the other hand, a LRR protein (AT1G67510) contains three Pfam domains, PF000560, PF00069, and PF08263. The highest prediction scores for these Pfam domains are 82.4%, 70.3% and 87.8% for plasma membrane localization, respectively. The final prediction score for this LRR protein for plasma membrane is then calculated as the geometric mean, i.e. the cubic root of (0.824 * 0.703 * 0.878) = 0.80. Characterization of the Pfam-based predictor was carried out by calculating the sensitivity and specificity of the predictor upon a non-independent set of proteins. Since the algorithm is highly dependent upon the number and uniqueness of Pfam domains to determine localization, the training set was used as a benchmark set to understand how well the algorithm would work in a best case scenario, since all the Pfam domains have already been seen in the training set. Sensitivity across subcellular localizations ranges from 65% (Vacuole) to 85% (Nucleus), while specificity drops down to only 76% ([pone.0015481.s010]). To illustrate the threshold-dependency of the algorithm performance, a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) plot was used ([pone.0015481.s002]). Across the different thresholds for including Pfam data in the final calculation, the localization algorithm performs much better than random localization as shown as dotted line on the ROC plots. This algorithm fills a specific need for the predicted localization of endomembrane system proteins. The performance of this algorithm can be readily compared to the best performing predictors as outlined in SUBA, the Arabidopsis subcellular database ([pone.0015481.s010]) [pone.0015481-Heazlewood1]. SUBA contains pre-calculated localization scores for all Arabidopsis proteins, and the sensitivity and specificity was calculated for the members of the training set for each of the different predictors. SUBA also makes an ‘all predictors’ call using a winner-takes-all localization call to combine the results from multiple individual predictors. A comparison of this integrated ‘all predictors’ call with the Pfam-based predictor indicates that the most significant improvements in sensitivity over current predictors are found for the Golgi, plasma membrane, and vacuole ([pone-0015481-g003]). In fact only the WoLFPSORT algorithm provides any prediction for these locations, but shows a lower sensitivity rate compared with Pfam-based prediciton. This improvement in localization capability is likely due to the various predictors focusing on properties and datasets not well tailored to the endomembrane system. Based on the improvement in the endomembrane prediction, we named this prediction method PFANTOM (plant protein family information-based predictor for endomembrane) and used [pone.0015481.s009] as the PFANTOM tool. (A) Comparison of the prediction performance of Pfam-based prediction (PFANTOM), all predictors by SUBA database, and WoLF PSORT. NC, nucleus; MT, mitochondrion; V, vacuole; PX, peroxisome; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; GO, Golgi apparatus; CT, cytosol; PM, plasma membrane; PL, plastid; EX, extracellular. (B-T) Subcellular localization of transiently expressed YFP-fusion proteins in N. benthamiana.

A summary of the localization experiments is shown in [pone-0015481-t002]. Scale bar = 20 µm. To validate the predictions given by PFANTOM, we selected 16 Arabidopsis proteins predicted by PFANTOM to be located in nucleus, Golgi apparatus, and plasma membrane ([pone-0015481-t002]). Thirteen of the Arabidopsis proteins have not previously been examined for their intracellular distribution, whereas the remaining three proteins (ROP7, RIC2, RIC4) have been reported in fluorescent fusion protein experiments to be located in plasma membrane [pone.0015481-Brembu1], [pone.0015481-Gu1] and were included as positive controls. For all 16 proteins the intracellular localization was determined by transiently expressing YFP-fusion proteins in Nicotiana benthamiana ([pone-0015481-t002], [pone-0015481-g003]). For comparison we also predicted localization with publically available web-based algorithms ([pone-0015481-t002]). As predicted by PFANTOM, two transcription factors, bHLH protein (AT5G48560; [pone-0015481-g003]) and SND1 (AT1G32770; [pone-0015481-g003]) showed the YFP signal in nucleus. AT3G18660 (PGSIP1; [pone-0015481-g003]), AT4G33330 (PGSIP3; [pone-0015481-g003]), AT5G01360 (DUF231 protein; [pone-0015481-g003]), and AT2G38320 (DUF231 protein; [pone-0015481-g003]) showed the YFP signal in small, moving, and oval dots very similar to what was seen with the Golgi marker (ST-tmd-GFP; [pone-0015481-g003]), and clearly different from the ER marker (GFP-HDEL; [pone-0015481-g003]), which showed typical network pattern. We selected PGSIP1 and PGSIP3, which were both predicted by PFANTOM to be Golgi localized, although PGSIP1 has been reported to be a chloroplast protein [pone.0015481-Chatterjeea1] and the Arabidopsis protein does have an N-terminal sequence that appears to fulfill the characteristics of a transit peptide according to the TargetP predictor. Furthermore, we also selected two DUF231 proteins, which were ambiguously predicted to be vacuolar, but which belong to a large family of proteins, several of which are known to play a role in cell wall structure [pone.0015481-Bischoff1]. For the Plasma membrane and/or extracellular localized proteins, YFP fusion proteins of GH19 family and GPI anchored proteins such as AT3G16920 (CTL2; [pone-0015481-g003]), AT5G03170 (FLA11; [pone-0015481-g003]), AT5G60490 (FLA12; [pone-0015481-g003]), AT5G15630 (COBL4, IRX6; [pone-0015481-g003]), AT1G67510 (LRR protein; [pone-0015481-g003]), AT2G28250 (NCRK; [pone-0015481-g003]), AT1G27380 (RIC2; [pone-0015481-g003]), AT5G16490 (RIC4; [pone-0015481-g003]), AT5G45970 (ROP7; [pone-0015481-g003]) showed the YFP signals as a single layer surrounding the cytoplasm identical to what was observed with a plasma membrane marker (pm-rk; [pone-0015481-g003]). Interestingly, CTL2 and FLA11 show oval dots in addition to the plasma membrane signal. These dots were larger than for Golgi and we are uncertain what they represent. The YFP signal of AT2G45890 (RopGEF4; [pone-0015481-g003]) belonging to the GEF family, which is recruited to lipid rafts for small GTPase activation [pone.0015481-Prag1], [pone.0015481-Yang1] was not uniformly distributed but observed as large dots associated within the plasma membrane, suggesting an interaction with endogenous membrane proteins. The results show that for 11 of the 13 proteins (16 proteins excluding the three positive controls), i.e. all the nuclear and plasma membrane proteins and for the PGSIP proteins, there was agreement between the predicted location by PFANTOM and the observed localization ([pone-0015481-t002]). Sixteen co-expressed genes were selected and intracellular localization was predicted by iPSORT [pone.0015481-Bannai1], MitoProt II [pone.0015481-Claros1], Predotar [pone.0015481-Small1], TargetP.1 [pone.0015481-Emanuelsson1], and WoLFPSORT [pone.0015481-Horton1]. Pfam was the prediction method described in this study, and experimental data are shown in [pone-0015481-g005]. NC, nucleus; MT, mitochondrion; V, vacuole; PX, peroxisome; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; GO, Golgi apparatus; CT, cytosol; PM, plasma membrane; PL, plastid; EX, extracellular. In an attempt to integrate the localization predictions based on Pfam and the co-expression information from Arabidopsis and rice, we examined the Pfam domain information from the intersection sets identified in the previous sections, comprising 124 and 83 genes for Arabidopsis and rice, respectively ([pone.0015481.s003], [pone.0015481.s005] and [pone.0015481.s007]). [pone.0015481.s011] outlines the Pfam annotations in the high-ranking co-expression sets showing an average MR of less than 70. Interestingly, many of the Pfam domains were identified in both co-expression sets, suggesting functional components present in both Arabidopsis and rice. Furthermore, several sets of Pfam annotations were unique to either Arabidopsis or rice and likely relate to distinct features of their cell walls. Lastly, to obtain an insight into the putative functional interaction at the subcellular level, the localization of high-ranking co-expressed components in [pone.0015481.s011] were predicted by the PFANTOM ([pone.0015481.s003], [pone.0015481.s009]). [pone-0015481-t003] outlines the putative intracellular distribution of each Pfam domain from the co-expression set. The majority of proteins from this collection of tightly co-expressed genes could be assigned to three distinct intracellular compartments, the Golgi apparatus (13 Pfam domains), the plasma membrane (21 Pfam domains), and the nucleus (8 Pfam domains). This information assisted modeling of potential interactions in the context of shared subcellular localization. An intracellular working model was constructed outlining common and unique machinery in both Arabidopsis and rice ([pone.0015481.s003], [pone-0015481-g004]). (A) Xylan synthesis candidates in Golgi apparatus. The components in this model correspond to [pone.0015481.s006]. In general only the larger gene family name is shown, except for GT8 and epimerases, which have many members of different molecular function and include PGSIP, IRX8, PARVUS, and UXS. Three gray color components, GT61, RGP and PGSIP proteins, were identified as co-expressed genes unique to Arabidopsis or rice. (B) Signaling and regulatory components on the plasma membrane to nucleus in mammals, Arabidopsis and rice. The components in this model correspond to genes outlined in [pone-0015481-t003]. Proteins with a predicted location score more than 0.65 with common functional domain group in mammals and plants were selected as the components on plasma membrane. For the nucleus, proteins with functional domain typically annotated as transcription factor and with a predicted location score greater than 0.8 are shown in this model. Groups of protein with the same Pfam domains were found in co-expression dataset. The table shows groups, where at least one gene exhibited an average MR of less than 70. The number of genes corresponding to each Pfam is from the entire co-expression set in Arabidopsis ([pone.0015481.s004]) and rice ([pone.0015481.s006]). The AGI and RAP codes are listed in [pone.0015481.s011]. The predicted location and score are shown according to the Pfam-based predictor. Abbreviations for subcellular compartments are the same as in [pone-0015481-t002]. a)PF01370, PF03005, PF04669, PF03151, PF4577, and PF07779 proteins have been observed in Golgi apparatus (unpublished data) [pone.0015481-Dunkley1]. Based on the references they were categorized into Golgi apparatus, although they showed a low score by PFANTOM. The co-expression analysis identified a number of GTs located in the Golgi apparatus ([pone-0015481-t003], [pone-0015481-g004]). Most of these were the IRX genes already known to be involved in xylan biosynthesis. The four additional GT groups identified were RGP (GT75) and GT61 in rice, PGSIP1 and PGSIP3 in Arabidopsis, and GT31 proteins in both species but most highly co-expressed in rice. The rice RGPs (UAM1 and UAM3) have been shown to be UDP-arabinose mutases [pone.0015481-Konishi1]. Since arabinose is abundant in rice xylan but has not been detected in Arabidopsis xylan, the data suggest that GT61 could be xylan arabinosyltransferases, in agreement with earlier speculations [pone.0015481-Scheller1], [pone.0015481-Toole1]. The GT31 proteins do not have an obvious suggested function, but they may be involved in synthesis of arabinogalactan proteins, e.g. the FLA11 and FLA12 proteins that are also seen in the co-expressed data sets. PGSIP1 and PGSIP3 proteins belong to GT8 family which in contrast to GT61 and GT31 contains retaining enzymes [pone.0015481-Yin1]. PGSIP proteins are only distantly related to the PARVUS and IRX8 proteins. Therefore, the most obvious function of PGSIP1 and PGSIP3 would be as xylan α-glucuronosyltransferases, given that a major difference between rice and Arabidopsis secondary walls is the 10-fold higher GlcA/Xyl ratio in Arabidopsis (data not shown). To test this hypothesis, we analyzed an Arabidopsis mutant in the PGSIP1 gene, which is more highly expressed in stems than PGSIP3. The pgsip1 mutant has a T-DNA insertion in the coding region and plants carrying the homozygous insertion were selected by PCR. No functional transcript could be detected in plants homozygous for the insertion ([pone-0015481-g005]). Although no morphological or irx phenotype was observed for the pgsip1 mutant line [pone.0015481-Brown1], the monosaccharide composition of cell walls from pgsip1 stems revealed a highly significant 66% reduction in the content of GlcA compared to the wild type ([pone-0015481-g005]). None of the other monosaccharides showed a difference. We furthermore tested the xylan GlcA transferase activity in microsomes isolated from stems, using an assay with exogenous xylohexaose as acceptor. The results showed that the GlcA transferase activity in pgsip1 was only about 50% of the wild type level ([pone-0015481-g005]). This data strongly supports the hypothesis that PGSIP1 (and likely PGSIP3 as well) is a xylan α-glucuronosyltransferase. Obviously, it will be necessary to substantiate this hypothesis by analysis of an independent allele or complementation of the mutant. (A) A T-DNA insertion mutant carrying an insertion in the third exon of PGSIP1 (AT3G18660) was obtained. White arrows indicate primer-annealing sites used for genotyping of the plants, and black arrows indicate primer-annealing sites used for RT-PCR. (B) No functional transcript could be detected by RT-PCR in homozygous individuals. (C) Cell wall material isolated from the first to the third internode of inflorescence stems showed significantly lower contents of GlcA compared to wild type (Col-0) plants (five biological replicates, values are mean ± SD, significantly different at p<10−6 (t-test)). (D) Xylan glucuronosyltransferase activity was determined in microsomes prepared from the second internode of inflorescence stems. Data shown are mean ± SD with three biological replicates, each consisting of stem internodes from four plants. The activity is shown in dpm, where the maximal activity determined for Col-0 is about 400 dpm corresponding to 0.15 nmol GlcA incorporated per mg of protein.
!~MM~! Co-expression information was obtained from the ATTED-II database (http://atted.jp). Source of GeneChip data in ATTED-II version 5.5 are the 1388 array slides from the 58 experiments on each developing stage, biotic and abiotic treatment. Scatter plots of co-expression of two genes were made with CoexViewer available at the ATTED-II database [pone.0015481-Kinoshita1]. ATTED-II provides the top 300 genes co-expressed with bait genes in both Arabidopsis and rice. We used three bait genes for each species, obtained the MR for each gene, and calculated the average MR as the geometric mean of the three individual MR. Transcript level information during developmental stage in Arabidopsis and rice were obtained from Arabidopsis Affymetrix DNA array data available from AtGeneExpress at TAIR (http://www.arabidopsis.org) and rice Affymetrix DNA array data GSE6893 available from Rice array database (http://www.ricearray.org) [pone.0015481-Jung1]. The Pfam database (ver. 24.0) has a collection of 7677 unique protein functional domains based on Hidden Markov Models (http://pfam.wustl.edu) [pone.0015481-Bateman1]. Pfam domain information of whole genome in Arabidopsis was downloaded from TAIR and for rice from the rice genome annotation project (http://rice.plantbiology.msu.edu)[pone.0015481-Ouyang1]. To develop the Pfam domain-based algorithm in plants, we downloaded Arabidopsis gene product information from the AmiGO database (http://amigo.geneontology.org) for the following localization terms; GO:0005634 (3012 proteins; nucleus), GO:0005739 (1310 proteins; mitochondrion), GO:0005773 (621 proteins; vacuole), GO:0005777 (201 proteins; peroxisome), GO:0005783 (407 proteins; endoplasmic reticulum), GO:0005794 (238 proteins; Golgi apparatus), GO:0005829 (669 proteins; cytosol), GO:0005886 (2236 proteins; plasma membrane), GO:0009504 (18 proteins; cell plate), GO:0009536 (3724 proteins; plastid), and GO:0048046 (333 proteins; extracellular). To remove uncertain localization annotations such as ‘by similarity’ or ‘probable’, we restricted the gene products to 4422 Arabidopsis genes with the IDA evidence code, which indicates that the annotation is derived from experimental data. Since a protein can have multiple Pfam domains, this set of 4422 genes encoded a total of 6141 Pfam domain annotations consisting of 1781 different Pfam domains ([pone.0015481.s008]). In order to make predictions about the location of un-localized proteins, a reference data set was established from the AmiGO-derived data, which captured the distribution of Pfam annotations across the different localization GO terms. Since it is possible in the training set for a single Pfam to be annotated to more than one subcellular localization, we define a localization ratio for a single Pfam as the percentage of time the Pfam annotation is seen in a given localization. For a new protein, a score (valued from 0–100%) for a single localization can be obtained by calculating the geometric mean of the localization ratio for each of the Pfam domains that it is annotated with. By calculating this score for all localizations, and selecting the localization with the highest score, it is possible to suggest the localization for a protein. All clones used in this study were constructed using Gateway™ technology (Invitrogen). The Entry clones were obtained via BP-reaction in pDONR-Zeo (for Golgi proteins) or through TOPO-reaction using the pENTR/D-TOPO vector (for plasma membrane and nuclear proteins). The genes were cloned using cDNA from Arabidopsis stem as template. The reverse primers contained no stop codon to enable C-terminal fusions. Sequences of forward and reverse primers can be sent on request. All Entry clones were verified by restriction analysis and sequencing. The binary vectors for expression of the N-terminal YFP fusion proteins under the control of 35S promoter were constructed via LR-reaction using the corresponding Entry clones. The full-length genes were cloned into the destination vectors pEarleyGate 101 [pone.0015481-Earley1]. Marker proteins for ER (GFP-HDEL), Golgi (STtmd-GFP), and plasma membrane (pm-rk) have been described previously [pone.0015481-Boevink1], [pone.0015481-Nelson1]. The gene encoding p19 protein from tomato bushy stunt virus was used to suppress gene silencing. All vectors were used to transform Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain C58-1 pGV3850. Prior to leaf infiltration the bacteria were resuspended in AS-medium (10 mM MgCl2, 150 µM acetosyringone, 10 mM MES pH 5.7) to OD600 0.5. Agrobacterium strains containing the YFP constructs and the p19 silencing plasmid were mixed 1∶1 and co-infiltrated into leaves of 3–4 week old N. benthamiana plants. Abaxial epidermis of infiltrated leaves was assayed for fluorescence by confocal laser-scanning microscopy 2–3 d post infiltration. A Leica confocal microscope (Leica Microsystems) was used for confocal laser-scanning microscopy. All images were obtained with 63× magnification and a glycerol-immersion objective. GFP and YFP channels were acquired by simultaneous scanning using 488-nm laser lines for excitation; signals were detected between 500 and 530 nm. Images were processed using the Leica Confocal Software (Leica Microsystems) and Adobe Photoshop 7.0. The T-DNA insertion mutant in the PGSIP1 gene (SALK_063763) was obtained from the Arabidopsis Biologial Resource Center, Ohio. Plants were grown under short day conditions (8 h photoperiod) in growth chambers for 6 weeks before they were transferred to a growth room with a long-day regime (16 h photoperiod). After 14 days growth under long-day conditions the first to third internodes were harvested and cell walls prepared, hydrolyzed with TFA and subsequently analyzed by HPAEC for monosaccharide composition as previously described [pone.0015481-Harholt2]. Xylan glucuronosyltransferase activity in microsomes prepared from stems was determined essentially as described [pone.0015481-York1], using 3.7 µM UDP-14C-d-GlcA (740 Bq per reaction, MP Biomedicals, Solon, Ohio), 50 µM unlabeled UDP-d-GlcA, and 6 µg xylohexaose (Megazyme, Bray, Ireland) as acceptor in a 30 µl reaction volume. Products were separated by paper chromatography and analyzed by liquid scintillation counting according to Lee et al. [pone.0015481-York1]. For RT-PCR, total RNA was isolated from frozen stem tissue using the Plant RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. First-strand DNA synthesis was performed with oligo(dT) anchor primer and Superscript III reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Two µL were used as template for PCR using the primers 5′-GTTTACGTCTGCGGTGCAAT-3′ and 5′-AATTATTGCGTCACAAGTTATGG-3′ to amplify PGSIP1 cDNA and 5′-CTCAAAGACCAGCTCTTCCATC-3′ and 5′-GCCTTTGATCTTGAGAGCTTAG–3′ to amplify ACT2 cDNA. The PCR program consisted of 2 min at 95°C, followed by 30 cycles of 20 s at 95°C, 30 s at 49°C, and 1 min 15 s at 72°C, with a final extension step of 10 min at 72°C. PCR products were visualized on 0.8% agarose gels.
