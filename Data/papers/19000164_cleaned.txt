!~ABS~! Plant growth and development is dependent on the specification and maintenance of pools of stem cells found in the meristems. Mutations in the Arabidopsis MERISTEM-DEFECTIVE (MDF) gene lead to a loss of stem cell and meristematic activity in the root and vegetative shoot. MDF encodes a putative RS domain protein with a predicted role in transcription or RNA processing control. mdf mutants exhibit decreased levels of PINFORMED2 (PIN2) and PIN4 mRNAs, which is associated with a reduction in PIN:GFP levels, and with a defective auxin maximum in the basal region of the developing mdf embryo and seedling root meristem. Seedling roots also exhibit reduced PLETHORA (PLT), SCARECROW and SHORTROOT gene expression, a loss of stem cell activity, terminal differentiation of the root meristem and defective cell patterning. MDF expression is not defective in the bodenlos, pin1 or eir1/pin2 auxin mutants, and is not modulated by exogenous auxin. plt1 plt2 double mutants have unaffected levels of MDF RNA, indicating that MDF acts upstream of PIN and PLT gene expression. Differentiation of the shoot stem cell pool also occurs in mdf mutants, associated with a reduced WUSCHEL (WUS) expression domain and expanded CLAVATA3 (CLV3) domain. Overexpression of MDF leads to the activation of markers of embryonic identity and ectopic meristem activity in vegetative tissues. These results demonstrate a requirement for the MDF-dependent pathway in regulating PIN/PLT- and WUS/CLV-mediated meristem activity.
!~RES~! We have previously used laser capture microdissection (LCM) and transcriptomics to analyse patterns of temporal and spatial gene expression during embryogenesis in Arabidopsis, with the aim of identifying genes required for meristem organization and identity (CITATION; CITATION). The MDF gene (At5g16780) was found to be preferentially expressed in the basal region of globular- and heart-stage embryos (CITATION). MDF encodes a predicted polypeptide of 820 amino acids, and in Arabidopsis only At3g14700 encodes a predicted protein (204 amino acids) sharing homology with MDF (45.9% identity at the amino acid level, limited to the C-terminal region of MDF). Putative orthologues of MDF exist in rice, brassica, medicago, vine and Physcomitrella. BLAST searches revealed homology with the animal SART-1 family of proteins, with 41% identity between MDF and human SART-1 (hSART-1) in the 250-amino-acid C-terminal domains, but with only limited homology elsewhere. hSART-1 has been shown to be an SR-related protein of the U4/U6.U5 tri small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (tri-snRNP) complex of the spliceosome, and is required for correct spliceosome assembly (CITATION). As with hSART-1, the N terminus of MDF contains a putative RS domain characterized by a number of arginine residues alternating with serine, glutamate or aspartate dipeptides, indicating that MDF is a putative SR-related protein (Figure S1; CITATION; CITATION). The MDF polypeptide is predicted to contain a C-terminal nuclear localization motif and an N-terminal RNA-binding domain, but no other conserved domains were identified (Figure S1; Prosite, http://www.expasy.ch/prosite; RNABindR, CITATION). To determine the spatial expression pattern of MDF in roots, we examined proMDF::GUS expression in seedlings. GUS activity was observed in the lateral root cap, columella and meristem, and was strongly active in the QC (Figure 1a). Expression was also found in young lateral root primordia, with weaker expression through the rest of the meristem and vasculature (Figure 1b). To determine the subellular localization of the MDF protein, proMDF::GFP:MDF protein fusion expression was determined in transgenic plants. Analysis of these plants by confocal laser scanning microsopy confirmed that the MDF polypeptide is preferentially localized to the nucleus in cells of the root meristem (Figure 1c,e): a control pro35S::GFP (lacking the targeting sequence) is localized to the cytoplasm (Figure 1d,f). A nuclear localization for MDF is also predicted by the Plant-PLoc protein localization software (CITATION). [[FIGURE]] To characterize the developmental role of the MDF gene, two T-DNA insertion alleles were identified. The mdf-1 allele contains an insertion within the ninth predicted intron (CITATION), whereas the mdf-2 allele has an insertion within the ninth exon; exon 1, 5′ to the ATG start codon, is non-coding (Figure 2a). A wild-type MDF transcript could not be detected in plants homozygous for either mdf-1 or mdf-2, indicating that these are putative null alleles (Figure 2b). Homozygous mdf-1 and mdf-2 seedlings displayed similar phenotypes, being severely dwarfed, with typically three cotyledons, and a reduced root system (Figure 2c). The mutation was seedling-lethal, with 100% lethality by ca. 20–25 days post-germination (d.p.g.). This phenotype segregated with the T-DNA insertions in the MDF gene, and was complemented by the introduction of an MDF cDNA (proMDF::MDF), confirming this function. [[FIGURE]] To further characterize the function of the MDF gene we first investigated its role in root development. The primary root of the mdf-1 mutant is significantly shorter than that of wild-type seedlings (3.4 ± 0.2 mm versus 21.6 ± 1.2 mm; 7 d.p.g., n = 20, P = 1.3 × 10−9). We examined roots at 2 and 7 d.p.g. to determine if this resulted from a reduction in either meristematic activity or cell length. At both time points both the size of the proximal meristem and the length of mature cortical cells were significantly shorter in mdf-1 mutants, indicating that both reduced meristematic activity and cell expansion contribute to the shorter roots of mdf mutants (Figure 3a). The reduction in size of the proximal meristem is also demonstrated by an analysis of the expression of the CYCAT1::CDB:GUS marker (CITATION). The number of dividing cells, as detected by the CYCAT1::CDB:GUS marker, was highly variable in mdf-1 mutants (Figure 3c,d), compared with the wild type (Figure 3b). Moreover, the dividing cells occupied a smaller area in mdf-1, indicating a reduction in the population of dividing cells in the mdf-1 root meristem. It was also found that between the two time points the proximal meristem in mdf-1 mutants was reduced in size. No reduction in size of the proximal meristem was observed in wild-type roots or in the size of mature cortical cells in both the wild-type and mdf-1 mutant between 2 and 7 d.p.g. (Figure 3a). [[FIGURE]] To determine whether MDF is also required for correct root meristem patterning, we examined the expression of different tissue-specific markers in the mdf-1 mutant. Enhancer trap J2672 marks the endodermis, and was typically observed in isolated cells and in non-contiguous files of cells in mdf-1 roots (Figure 3e,f). Similar observations were made for enhancer traps J2341 and J1092, which mark the ground tissue and vascular initials (J2341; Figure 3g,h), and the lateral root cap and QC (J1092; Figure 3i,j), where again mdf-1 roots showed expression in isolated cells or a reduced expression domain. These results indicate an inability either to specify or maintain the root radial pattern and cell identity in mdf-1. To determine whether these defects were the result of an inability to correctly specify QC cells, which act as a central organizer in the root meristem, we examined the expression of the marker QC25 (CITATION) in mdf-1. At 5 d.p.g. QC25 activity was observed in both wild-type and mdf-1 root meristems (Figure 3k,l). However, in mdf-1 often only a single cell showed expression of the QC25 marker (Figure 3l). By 9 d.p.g. cells marked by QC25 expression were more distally positioned in the mdf-1 mutant compared with the wild type (Figure 3m,n), which appeared to result from a loss of root cap cells. To determine if this was the case, we examined the columella cells over a developmental time course in the mdf-1 mutant. As early as 2 d.p.g., the columella of mdf-1 lacks organization, and is not arranged in the distinctive tiers displayed by the wild type (Figure 3o,p). At 5 d.p.g. fewer cells have columella cell identity, as determined by the presence of starch granules (Figure 3q,r), and no columella cells are evident by 10 d.p.g., indicating a failure to specify columella cells associated with a terminal differentiation of the root meristem (Figure 3s,t). The establishment of an auxin gradient and maximum in the root is critical for correct meristem organization, and this is determined by correct PIN protein expression and localization (CITATION; CITATION). PIN4 and PIN2 in particular have significant roles in directional auxin flow through the root cap and epidermis, and in maintaining the auxin reflux loop (CITATION; CITATION). To determine if the defects in cell specification and QC size in mdf-1 mutants are associated with defective PIN gene expression, transcription analysis and PIN:GFP localization was carried out. Quantitative real-time RT-PCR showed that transcript levels of PIN2 and PIN4 were significantly reduced in mdf-1 mutants, although other members of the PIN family showed only minor changes in expression levels (Figure 4a). Transcriptional changes for these PIN genes were also reflected in defective protein fusion levels. proPIN2::PIN4:GFP expression was found, as expected, in the basal cells of the wild-type heart-stage embryo, but it was absent in heart-stage mdf-1 embryos (Figure 4b). Wild-type seedlings containing proPIN2::PIN2:GFP and proPIN4::PIN4:GFP constructs showed the expected localization of PIN2:GFP in the cortical and epidermal layers of the root (Figure 4c), and of PIN4:GFP in the meristem and columella (Figure 4d). In mdf-1 mutants, however, although the cellular polarity of the PIN2:GFP and PIN4:GFP appeared essentially correct, PIN2:GFP levels were much reduced in the epidermal layer (Figure 4c), and the PIN4:GFP expression domain was much reduced in the columella (Figure 4d). [[FIGURE]] To determine whether auxin distribution was also disrupted in the mutant, we examined expression of the auxin-responsive DR5::GFP reporter (CITATION). In the mdf-1 heart-stage embryo, the typical expression of DR5::GFP in the incipient root meristem is absent (Figure 4e). DR5::GFP expression in mdf-1 seedling root tips was significantly reduced, and was restricted to the QC and central columella, with none detected in the lateral root cap as observed in the wild type (Figure 4f). Together, these data show that MDF function is required for the correct PIN2 and PIN4 gene expression and auxin distribution in the embryo, and in the seedling. Given the role of phytohormones in root meristem organization and maintenance, and the defects observed in mdf mutants, we examined whether hormones regulate MDF expression. Exogenous treatment of seedlings with auxin, cytokinin and gibberellic acid did not significantly affect transcript levels or the spatial expression pattern of MDF (Figure 4g and data not shown), suggesting that MDF is not transcriptionally regulated by these hormones. Furthermore, MDF expression is not affected in the auxin transport mutants pin1 or eir1/pin2 (Figure 4h), nor is the mdf-1 root phenotype rescued by growth in the presence of auxins (data not shown). The auxin-insensitive bodenlos (bdl) mutant fails to establish a QC during embryogenesis (Hamann et al., 1999, 2002). Although the root of bdl mutants is highly disorganized, MDF is still expressed (Figure 4i). Together, these data show that MDF expression is regulated independently of these auxin transport and signalling pathways. The establishment of an auxin peak around the QC and root cap, as well as correct auxin signalling, is required for the expression of PLT1 and PLT2 (CITATION). Interestingly, roots of mdf mutants resemble those of plt1 plt2 double mutants. It is therefore possible that MDF acts upstream of the auxin distribution pathway, and of the PLT genes. To investigate this, we examined the expression of the PLT genes, and of other transcriptional regulators required for meristem specification and positioning, in mdf-1 mutants. PLT1, PLT2 and the related AP2-like transcription factor BABY BOOM (BBM) all showed significant reductions in transcript levels in the mdf-1 mutant (Figure 5a). Similarly, the transcript levels of SCR and SHR, which are independent of the PLT genes and auxin, are reduced in mdf-1, consistent with the defective radial patterning and QC specification (Figure 5a). We also determined whether the failure to maintain the root meristem in plt1 plt2 double mutants is caused by a reduction in MDF expression. However, MDF transcript levels are not detectably affected in plt1 plt2 seedlings (Figure 5b). Furthermore, MDF expression was not dependent on SHR and SCR activity (Figure 5c), indicating that MDF acts independently of these meristem regulators. [[FIGURE]] Given the root meristem defects in mdf mutants, we asked whether MDF is also required to maintain the stem cell population of the shoot. Consistent with such a role, proMDF::GUS expression was found in the shoot apex (Figure 6a), and the mdf seedling shoot typically exhibits three cotyledons. WUS expression occurs below the stem cell population in the shoot apical meristem (SAM), and positively controls the size of the stem cell population in a non-cell autonomous manner (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION). In mdf-1 mutants, the domain of WUS expression, determined using proWUS::nlSGUS, was consistently reduced compared with that found in wild-type seedlings (Figure 6b,c), which is consistent with a role for MDF in the SAM, and with the gradual loss of meristem activity observed in mdf mutants. [[FIGURE]] WUS acts in a feedback loop with the CLAVATA genes CLV1, CLV2 and CLV3. They negatively regulate the shoot stem cell population, and a loss of WUS activity leads to an expansion of the CLV3 expression domain, which marks the stem cell niche in the shoot. Consistent with reduced WUS expression, CLV3 expression was upregulated in mdf-1 (Figure 6d). clv3-2 mdf-1 double mutants show a shoot phenotype intermediate between the two parental mutants, suggesting that MDF does not function directly in the same genetic pathway as CLV3 to regulate meristem activity (Figure S2). As mdf mutants are unable to maintain meristem activity, we investigated whether MDF expression is sufficient to promote stem cell identity or meristem activity. The approach was to overexpress ectopically the MDF cDNA under the control of the CaMV35S RNA gene promoter (Figure 7a). Seven independent pro35S::MDF lines were generated, and T1 and T2 lines of each were found to contain morphologically abnormal seedlings. Predominantly, these included seedlings that resemble those previously described following ectopic expression of the embryogenic identity gene LEC1, resulting in a turnip (tnp)-like mutant phenotype exhibiting ectopic accumulation of storage products (Figure 7b; CITATION). Similarly, we found ectopic accumulation of oils at the root–hypocotyl junction, one characteristic of embryonic tissues (CITATION; Figure 7c–f). Other lines displayed ectopic shoot formation (Figure 7g), resembled mutants defective in the CUP-SHAPED COTYLEDON genes (Figure 7h; CITATION) or completely lacked a root meristem (Figure 7i). [[FIGURE]] The phenotypes of these pro35S::MDF seedlings did not correlate with changes in the mRNA levels of the root meristem regulators PLT1, PLT2, SCR, SHR or the embryo-specific LEC1 transcription factor, nor was the expression of these genes influenced following inducible overexpression of MDF (data not shown). Furthermore, the penetrance of the phenotypes of the pro35S::MDF lines was not influenced by growth in the presence of phytohormones (data not shown), as has been demonstrated for pickle (CITATION) and tnp mutants (CITATION). Taken together, this suggests that MDF is able to confer embryonic or meristematic identity on vegetative tissue.

Light micrographs were taken using a CoolSNAP digital camera (Photometrics, http://www.photomet.com) with Openlab v3.1.1 (Improvision Ltd, http://www.improvision.com) on Leica MZ125 (Leica Microsystems, http://www.leica-microsystems.com), Olympus SZH10 (Olympus, http://www.olympus-global.com) or Zeiss Axioskop (Carl Zeiss, http://www.zeiss.com) microscopes. Root meristem and cell measurements were performed using Volocity v4.2 (Improvision). Confocal images were taken with a Bio-Rad Radiance 2000 microscope (Bio-Rad, http://www.bio-rad.com) after counterstaining tissues with 10 mg ml−1 propidium iodide. Staining of the columella root cap for the presence of starch was done by placing seedlings in Lugol’s solution (Sigma-Aldrich) for 5 min. Images were processed in Adobe Photoshop v7.0 (http://www.adobe.com). For proMDF::GFP:MDF, the MDF promoter and cDNA were inserted into the plant binary vector pGreenNtailGFP (kindly supplied by Patrick Hussey, Durham University, http://www.dur.ac.uk), and Col-0 plants were transformed. Oligonucleotides for promoter and cDNA amplification are: MDF-Prom, 5′-ACGGGCCCGAGAAACCAGATCCTTCTTC-3′ and 5′-ACGCGGCCGCGAACTTTAGTCAAGACCTAACCAC-3′; MDF-cDNA, 5′-CGGTCGACGAAGTGGAGAAGTCTAAATCAAGGC-3′ and 5′-GGGGATCCTCAAGGCTTTGGTCTCTTTGGTGG-3′. The CaMV35S promoter of pGreenNtailGFP was replaced with the MDF promoter as an Apa1–Not1 fragment, and the MDF cDNA was inserted as a Sal1–BamH1 fragment. For pro35S::MDF, the MDF cDNA was amplified using the oligonucleotides 5′-CTGTCGACGAAAATGGAAGTGGAGAAGTC-3′ and 5′-CTGTCGACCAAAGACGCAAGCAAGACC-3′. A CaMV35S promoter and terminator cassette was cloned as an EcoR1 fragment into the binary vector pCIRCE (a gift from M. Bevan, John Innes Centre, http://www.jic.ac.uk). The MDF cDNA was then cloned between the CaMV35S promoter and terminator as a Sal1 fragment. For complementation of the mdf-1 mutant, the MDF promoter and cDNA were amplified using the oligonucleotides: MDF promoter, 5′-TCGGTACCGAGAAACCAGATCCTTCTTC-3′ and 5′-ACGGGCCCGAACTTTAGTCAAGACCTAACCAC-3′; and cDNA, 5′-CGGTCGACATGGAAGTGGAGAAGTCTAAATCAAGGC-3′ and 5′-GGGGATCCTCAAGGCTTTGGTCTCTTTGGTGG-3′. The MDF promoter was inserted into the pGreen 0179 vector (http://www.pgreen.ac.uk) as a Kpn1–Apa1 fragment, and the MDF cDNA was inserted as a Sal1–BamH1 fragment. Plant transformation was performed by the floral-dip method (CITATION) using the Agrobacterium tumefaciens C58C1 (CITATION). Primary transformants were selected on growth medium supplemented with either 50 mg l−1 kanamycin (pCIRCE- and pGreenNtailGFP-based constructs) or 20 mg l−1 hygromycin B (pGreen 0179). Tissue localization of GUS enzyme activity was performed as described by CITATION. For semiquantitative RT-PCR, RNA was extracted from seedlings at 7 d.p.g. using the RNeasy Plant RNA Extraction kit (Qiagen, http://www.qiagen.com). RT-PCR was performed using the OneStep RT-PCR kit (Qiagen), as detailed in the manufacturer’s instructions. Total RNA was treated with DNase according to the method of CITATION, and 250 ng of RNA was used per reaction. The oligonucleotide pairs used for amplification were: ACT1, 5′-GATCCTAACCGAGCGTGGTTAC-3′ and 5′-GACCTGACTCGTCATACTCTGC-3′; MDF, 5′-CAGGCAGTTGCGCATCTTGTGG-3′ and 5′-GGAATTTGTGCGAGAGTAGTCG-3′; SCR, 5′-CACATTGCTGCTACAGTGTGC-3′ and 5′-CAGTAGAGTCGCTTGTGTAGC-3′; SHR, 5′-CACTACTCCCACCCAATACC-3′ and 5′-CATCCTCCTCGACCACTTCCTCG-3′. Typical reaction conditions were 50°C for 30 min, 95°C for 15 min, followed by two cycles of 94°C denaturation for 30 sec, 65°C primer annealing for 30 sec, and a 72°C extension for 60 sec. This was followed by 20–40 cycles of 94°C denaturation for 30 sec, 55°C primer annealing for 30 sec, and a 72°C extension for 60 sec, with a final extension at 72°C for 7 min. Minus RT control experiments were performed by adding enzyme after the 50°C incubation. For quantitative real-time RT-PCR, RNA was extracted from seedlings at 7 d.p.g. and was purified as described above. cDNA was synthesized using the SuperScript cDNA synthesis Kit (Invitrogen, http://www.invitrogen.com). Total RNA (5 μg) was used as the template, and oligo dT was used as the primer. The cDNA preparations were diluted 1:4 prior to using them as PCR templates. PCR reactions were carried out in a RotorGene 3000 (Corbett Research, http://www.corbettlifescience.com). Data was analysed using the Comparative Quantification program (Rotor-Gene v6.0.19). PCR reactions were set-up using the SYBER Green JumpStart Taq ReadyMix (Sigma-Aldrich), with 0.25 mm of each primer in a total volume of 20 μl. The PCR reaction conditions comprised an initial denaturation step of 95°C for 3 min followed by 40 repeats of 95°C for 20 sec, 55°C for 20 sec and 72°C for 20 sec. A melting curve protocol immediately followed the amplification cycles that comprised heating from 55 to 95°C in 1°C increments, holding for 5 s at each stage. Reactions were set-up in triplicate, and were repeated with two biological replicates. The abundance of each transcript is expressed relative to the UBIQUITIN transcript.
