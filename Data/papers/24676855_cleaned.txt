!~ABS~! The phytohormone abscisic acid (ABA) is crucial for plant growth and adaptive responses to various stress conditions. Plants continuously adjust the ABA level to meet physiological needs, but how ABA homeostasis occurs is not fully understood. This study provides evidence that UGT71B6, an ABA uridine diphosphate glucosyltransferase (UGT), and its two closely related homologs, UGT71B7 and UGT71B8, play crucial roles in ABA homeostasis and in adaptation to dehydration, osmotic stress, and high-salinity stresses in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). UGT RNA interference plants that had low levels of these three UGT transcripts displayed hypersensitivity to exogenous ABA and high-salt conditions during germination and exhibited a defect in plant growth. However, the ectopic expression of UGT71B6 in the atbg1 (for β-glucosidase) mutant background aggravated the ABA-deficient phenotype of atbg1 mutant plants. In addition, modulation of the expression of the three UGTs affects the expression of CYP707A1 to CYP707A4, which encode ABA 8′-hydroxylases; four CYP707As were expressed at higher levels in the UGT RNA interference plants but at lower levels in the UGT71B6:GFP-overexpressing plants. Based on these data, this study proposes that UGT71B6 and its two homologs play a critical role in ABA homeostasis by converting active ABA to an inactive form (abscisic acid-glucose ester) depending on intrinsic cellular and environmental conditions in plants.
!~RES~! Arabidopsis UGTs represent a superfamily containing more than 100 homologs (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION). Phylogenetic analysis reveals that the Arabidopsis UGT superfamily can be divided into 12 distinct subgroups (CITATION). UGT71B6 is located in group E. Two additional UGT homologs that are in group E with UGT71B6, At3g21790 and At3g21800, have more than 90% amino acid sequence similarity to UGT71B6 (Fig. 1A) and are located immediately upstream and downstream of UGT71B6 on chromosome 3, respectively. Thus, At3g21790 and At3g21800 were named UGT71B7 and UGT71B8, respectively. [[FIGURE]] To test whether UGT71B7 and UGT71B8 have similar functions to UGT71B6 with respect to inactivation of ABA, we examined the effect of these genes on the expression of an ABA-responsive gene using protoplasts derived from wild-type Arabidopsis (ecotype Columbia [Col-0]; CITATION). First, we established how UGT71B6 affects the expression of ABA-responsive genes in protoplasts. For this experiment, we produced a fusion construct containing the firefly luciferase (LUC) reporter driven by the ABA-responsive RD29A promoter (RD29Ap; CITATION). A second construct containing UGT71B6 tagged with GFP at the C terminus, or containing only GFP as a control, was used as an effector. The LUC and UGT71B6 constructs were cotransformed into protoplasts, or LUC and GFP control, and the transcript level of LUC was determined by quantitative real-time (qRT)-PCR. The LUC transcripts were significantly reduced when cotransformed with UGT71B6, compared with that for the cotransformation of LUC with GFP as a control effector (Fig. 1B). These results confirm that UGT71B6 reduces cellular ABA levels. Next, we examined the effect of the two UGT homologs, UGT71B7 and UGT71B8, on the expression of LUC. When GFP-tagged forms of UGT71B7 and UGT71B8 were cotransformed with RD29Ap:LUC, they suppressed the expression of LUC as was observed for cotransformation with UGT71B6. However, an unrelated UGT, UGT73B1, which belongs to group D (CITATION), did not show any noticeable effect on the expression of LUC when the GFP-tagged form of UGT73B1 was cotransformed into protoplasts with RD29Ap:LUC (Fig. 1B). These results indicate that UGT71B7 and UGT71B8 reduce the ABA levels similar to that observed for UGT71B6, thereby resulting in the suppression of RD29Ap:LUC. In addition, these results suggest that the C-terminal GFP moiety did not affect the activity of UGTs. These results prompted us to examine if these genes play a role in osmotic stress responses. Therefore, we examined their gene expression under osmotic stress conditions. The expression of UGT71B6 is induced under high osmotic stress conditions and by the application of exogenous ABA (CITATION). To test whether the expression of UGT71B7 and UGT71B8 is regulated under these conditions, 2-week-old wild-type plants were treated with 100 μm ABA, 100 mm NaCl, or 300 mm mannitol for 1 h, and total RNA from these plants was used for qRT-PCR analysis. UGT71B6 was included as a positive control. The transcript levels of these three UGT homologs were rapidly induced by ABA, NaCl, and mannitol treatments, albeit at different levels (Fig. 1C). These results indicate that UGT71B7 and UGT71B8 are involved in the osmotic stress response. Next, we examined the spatial expression patterns of these three UGT homologs. To quantify the expression level, total RNA was prepared from rosettes, cauline leaves, stems, flowers, siliques, and roots of wild-type plants and subjected to qRT-PCR analysis. UGT71B6 was expressed at high levels in rosette and cauline leaves, at low levels in stems, flowers, and siliques, and essentially no expression was detected in root tissues. UGT71B7 was expressed at high levels in rosette and cauline leaves, flowers, and siliques, at low levels in stems, and essentially no expression was detected in roots. By contrast, UGT71B8 was strongly expressed only in siliques, with a low level of expression in flowers (Supplemental Fig. S1, A–C). These results indicate that the three UGTs showed different spatial and tissue-specific expression patterns. In addition, we also examined the spatial expression patterns of three UGT homologs upon abiotic stresses using transgenic plants harboring the UGT promoter-GUS constructs. The promoter regions of three UGTs were placed upstream of the GUS coding region, and transgenic plants harboring these constructs were generated. Two-week-old UGT71B6p:GUS, UGT71B7p:GUS, and UGT71B8p:GUS seedlings were treated with 100 μm ABA or dehydration stress for 3 h. The GUS expression in rosette leaves of all three transgenic plants was higher under both ABA and dehydration stress conditions than under the no-stress condition, suggesting that all three UGTs are involved in the osmotic stress and drought responses, which is consistent with the data shown in Figure 1C (Supplemental Fig. S1D). To obtain insight into the physiological roles of UGT homologs at the cellular level, we examined their subcellular localizations. We generated transgenic plants expressing the three UGTs tagged with GFP at the C terminus under the control of the 35S promoter. The localization of UGT71B6:GFP, UGT71B7:GFP, and UGT71B8:GFP was examined in protoplasts isolated from these transgenic plants. The GFP fluorescence of all three fusion proteins was observed as a diffuse pattern (Fig. 2A), indicating that they are localized in the cytosol. To verify this result, protein extracts from transgenic plants expressing UGT71B6:GFP, UGT71B7:GFP, and UGT71B8:GFP were separated into soluble and membrane fractions by ultracentrifugation, and the fractions were analyzed by western blotting using anti-GFP antibody. All three UGTs were detected in soluble fractions (Fig. 2B), which confirms their cytosolic localization. As a control for the soluble fractionation, Arabidopsis aleurain-like protein (AALP; CITATION) was detected with anti-AALP antibody. It was specifically detected in the soluble fraction, confirming the fractionation. [[FIGURE]] A previous work showed that UGT71B6 loss-of-function mutant plants did not display any noticeable phenotype (CITATION). When we examined single knockout mutants of UGT71B7 or UGT71B8, they did not show any noticeable phenotype (Supplemental Fig. S2). One possible explanation is a functional redundancy among these three UGTs. It may be necessary to generate double or triple UGT mutants to observe any noticeable phenotype. However, the tandem localization of the three genes on chromosome 3 makes it difficult to generate the double or triple knockout mutant plants. As an alternative approach, we generated inducible UGT RNA interference (RNAi) transgenic plants using a 450-bp fragment of the highly conserved region (shared among the three UGTs) under the control of the dexamethasone (Dex)-inducible promoter (Supplemental Fig. S3A). UGT RNAi transgenic plants were generated in the wild-type background; we obtained 23 independent lines at the F4 generation. In UGT RNAi line 31 (RNAi-31) and UGT RNAi line 42 (RNAi-42), the transcript levels of UGT71B6, UGT71B7, and UGT71B8, but not UGT73B1 used as a control, were greatly reduced when detected by qRT-PCR (Supplemental Fig. S3B). When continuously exposed to 30 μm Dex, UGT RNAi transgenic plants showed multiple phenotypes, such as smaller rosette leaves, shorter roots, and pale green leaves (Fig. 3A; Supplemental Fig. S3C). These phenotypes were observed only in UGT RNAi plants but not in pTA control plants, confirming that these phenotypes are caused by the suppression of the three UGTs. [[FIGURE]] Glc conjugation to the carboxyl group of (+)-ABA is one of the two catabolic pathways that lower ABA levels (CITATION; CITATION). We determined whether knockdown of UGT71B6, UGT71B7, and UGT71B8 affects ABA responses. In these experiments, vector control (VC), RNAi-31, and RNAi-42 seeds were planted on one-half-strength Murashige and Skoog (1/2 MS) plates supplemented with 30 μm Dex, and the germination rate was determined at varying time points. At 4 d after planting, the germination rate of VC seeds was more than 90%, whereas the germination rate of the two independent RNAi seeds was less than 35% (Fig. 3, B and C). When the germination rate was examined on a plate supplemented with 1 μm ABA or 100 mm NaCl in the presence of Dex, the seed germination rate was reduced further; at 4 d after planting, RNAi seeds treated with 100 mm NaCl barely produced any green cotyledons compared with the control seeds, which showed 30% cotyledon greening (Fig. 3D; Supplemental Fig. S4). One possible explanation is that the cellular ABA levels are higher in RNAi seeds than in VC seeds. Next, we examined the ABA-related developmental phenotype of RNAi plants at postgermination stages under different abiotic stress conditions. Transgenic plants of two independent RNAi and VC lines grown on 1/2 MS plates for 5 d were transplanted onto 1/2 MS plates containing 30 μm Dex together with 10 μm ABA or 200 mm mannitol. At 2 weeks after transplantation, plant growth was measured by the primary root length and fresh weight. The growth rate of RNAi transgenic plants was greatly reduced in the presence of exogenous ABA compared with that of the VC plants. Moreover, RNAi transgenic plants showed higher resistance to mannitol than VC plants (Fig. 3, E and F). These results indicate that UGT RNAi transgenic plants are hypersensitive to exogenous ABA and display enhanced resistance to osmotic stress. Next, to assess whether the suppression of all three UGTs has any effect on the dehydration stress response, we measured the relative water loss. The aerial parts of VC and RNAi plants were excised, and the rate of water loss was examined under dehydration conditions. RNAi plants lost water more slowly than VC plants, confirming that RNAi plants are more resistant to dehydration stress (Fig. 3G). To gain insight into the underlying cause of the ABA-hypersensitive phenotype, we examined whether the mode of ABA signaling was affected in RNAi transgenic plants. Total RNA was isolated from 10-d-old RNAi-42 transgenic plants grown in the presence or absence of 30 μm Dex for 10 h, and the expression of the ABA-responsive genes Responsive to Dessication29A (RD29A), RD29B, Cold Regulated47 (COR47), and Responsive to ABA18 (RAB18) and the cytokinin-responsive genes Type-A Responsive Regulator6(ARR6) and ARR15 as negative controls was examined by qRT-PCR. The Dex treatment increased the transcript levels of RD29A, RD29B, COR47, and RAB18 by more than 2-fold, whereas the expression of ARR6 and ARR15 was not altered (Fig. 3H). These results confirm that ABA-mediated signaling is specifically activated in UGT RNAi plants. UGT71B6:GFP-overexpressing transgenic plants (UGT71B6:GFP) cause no noticeable ABA-deficient phenotype or only a weakly deficient phenotype (Supplemental Fig. S5; CITATION), despite the fact that UGT71B6 can lower the cellular ABA level by converting ABA to ABA-GE. Similar to UGT71B6:GFP transgenic plants, both UGT71B7:GFP and UGT71B8:GFP transgenic plants did not display any noticeable alteration in osmotic and dehydration stress responses compared with wild-type plants except an increase in cotyledon greening in the presence of 6% Glc (Supplemental Fig. S5), indicating that overexpression of UGTs has a minor effect on ABA levels. Recent work shows that two β-glucosidases, AtBG1 and AtBG2, which localize to the ER and the vacuole, respectively, can hydrolyze ABA-GE to ABA (CITATION; CITATION). We questioned if AtBG1 and/or AtBG2 were involved in the lack of an apparent ABA-deficient phenotype in the UGT71B6-overexpressing transgenic plants. One possible scenario is that hydrolysis of ABA-GE to ABA by these two β-glucosidases may compensate for the UGT71B6-mediated reduction in ABA levels. To test this, we introduced UGT71B6:GFP into atbg1 mutant plants and examined their phenotype. Under normal growth conditions, transgenic plants of two independent lines, 4-3 (UGT71B6:GFP/atbg1-4.3) and 8-4 (UGT71B6:GFP/atbg1-8.4), showed a significantly higher germination rate than atbg1 or wild-type plants (Fig. 4A). The higher germination rate of UGT71B6:GFP/atbg1 transgenic plants was more prominent in the presence of 125 or 150 mm NaCl (Fig. 4, B and C). Similarly, UGT71B6:GFP/atbg1-4.3 and UGT71B6:GFP/atbg1-8.4 plants had significantly higher germination rates than atbg1 and wild-type plants in the presence of 0.5 μm ABA (Supplemental Fig. S6), indicating that the transgenic plants have lower levels of ABA. One possible explanation is that UGT71B6 overexpression causes a reduction of the cellular ABA level. These results also support the hypothesis that two opposing pathways, conjugation of Glc to ABA by UGT71B6 and hydrolysis of ABA-GE to ABA by AtBG1 and/or AtBG2, contribute to the homeostasis of cellular ABA levels. [[FIGURE]] To gain further insight into the physiological roles of UGT71B6, the aerial parts of wild-type, UGT71B6:GFP, atbg1, and UGT71B6:GFP/atbg1-4.3 plants were excised, and the rate of water loss was examined under dehydration conditions. As observed previously (CITATION), atbg1 plants displayed an increased rate of water loss compared with wild-type and UGT71B6:GFP plants (Fig. 4D). The rate of water loss in UGT71B6:GFP/atbg1-4.3 mutant plants was higher than that in UGT71B6:GFP or atbg1 plants and appeared to be equivalent to the additive effects of both UGT71B6:GFP and atbg1 plants. This indicates that UGT71B6 overexpression causes an additional reduction of ABA levels in the atbg1 background. To confirm this result, we grew wild-type, UGT71B6:GFP, atbg1, and UGT71B6:GFP/atbg1-4.3 plants for 3 weeks on soil under normal growth conditions, kept the plants in a greenhouse without watering for 10 d, and then started watering again. The survival rate was determined at 2 d after the start of rewatering (Fig. 4, E and F). UGT71B6:GFP/atbg1-4.3 plants were the most sensitive to dehydration stress, followed by atbg1 plants, indicating that UGT71B6 plays an important role in the cellular response to dehydration stress. To gain further insight into the function of UGT71B6 in osmotic stress responses, the expression of osmotic stress-inducible genes was examined in the UGT71B6:GFP/atbg1-4.3 plant. Total RNA from wild-type, atbg1, and UGT71B6:GFP/atbg1-4.3 plants that had been treated with or without 300 mm mannitol for 1 h was used for qRT-PCR analysis. aba3 mutant plants were included as a positive control. In UGT71B6:GFP/atbg1-4.3 plants, the induction of RD29A, RAB18, and COR47 by 300 mm mannitol was delayed compared with that in the atbg1 plants, which, in turn, was delayed compared with the expression in wild-type plants (Fig. 5). These results indicate that overexpression of UGT71B6 inhibits the expression of osmotic stress-inducible genes under high osmotic stress conditions. This occurs through a UGT71B6-mediated reduction of the cellular ABA levels. [[FIGURE]] To examine the effect of UGT71B6 overexpression on ABA levels in plants, the ABA content was measured by ELISA using an anti-ABA antibody (CITATION). Wild-type, atbg1, UGT71B6:GFP/atbg1-4.3, VC, and RNAi-42 plants were grown on 1/2 MS plates supplemented with or without 30 μm Dex (depending on the induction conditions of the transgenes). aba3 mutant plants were included as a control. Consistent with the published results (CITATION), ABA contents in the wild-type and aba3 seedlings were essentially the same under the no-stress condition. However, the ABA content of Dex-treated RNAi-42 plants was 200% that of the Dex-treated VC plants, whereas the ABA contents of atbg1 and UGT71B6:GFP/atbg1-4.3 plants were only 40% and 25% that of the wild type, respectively (Fig. 6). These results indicate that UGT71B6, UGT71B7, and UGT71B8 play important roles to reduce the cellular ABA level. These results are consistent with the phenotypes of these plants (CITATION). [[FIGURE]] The cellular ABA levels in plants are also reduced by the hydroxylation pathway. To gain insight into possible interactions between hydroxylation and conjugation catabolic pathways, we examined whether modulation of the expression of UGT71B6, UGT71B7, and UGT71B8 affects the expression of four genes, CYP707A1 to CYP707A4, which are involved in the hydroxylation of ABA. VC and RNAi-31 plants grown on 1/2 MS plates supplemented with 30 μm Dex were treated for 1 h with or without dehydration stress, and total RNA from these plants was used for qRT-PCR analysis of the four CYP70As. The transcript levels of all four CYP707As were significantly higher in RNAi-31 compared with VC plants, both with and without dehydration stress (Fig. 7A). Similarly, upon treatment with salt (100 mm NaCl) and osmotic stress (300 mm mannitol), the transcript levels of all four CYP707As were remarkably higher in RNAi-31 than in VC plants, both with or without stress treatment (Fig. 7, B and C). These results indicate that suppression of UGT expression induces the expression of CYP707A1 to CYP707A4, which functions to compensate for the loss of the UGT-mediated catabolic pathway. Next, we examined the transcript levels of the four CYP707As in UGT71B6:GFP plants after treatment for 1 h with or without dehydration stress. The transcript levels of the four CYP707As were strongly reduced in UGT71B6:GFP plants (Fig. 8A). Similar results were obtained with salt and osmotic stress treatments (Fig. 8, B and C), indicating that strong expression of UGT71B6 suppresses CYP707As. These results raised the possibility that a regulatory circuit exists to coordinate the opposing expression of genes involved in the two ABA catabolic pathways (Supplemental Figs. S7 and S8).

!~MM~! Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) plants (ecotype Col-0) were grown either on 1/2 MS plates at 20°C in a culture room or in a greenhouse with 70% relative humidity and a 16-h/8-h light/dark cycle at 20°C to 23°C. For NaCl, ABA, or mannitol treatment, plants grown in 1/2 MS liquid medium for 10 d were treated with 100 mm NaCl, 100 μm ABA, or 300 mm mannitol, respectively, for the indicated times as described previously (CITATION). To measure the growth of UGT RNAi plants, 5-d-old seedlings grown on 1/2 MS plates containing 1% (w/v) Suc and 0.8% (w/v) agar, pH 5.7, were transferred to 1/2 MS plates supplemented with 30 μm Dex and 10 μm ABA or 200 mm mannitol. Primary root length and fresh weight were measured 2 weeks after transplantation. For growth measurements of transgenic plants overexpressing three UGTs, seeds were sown on 1/2 MS plates supplemented with 6% (w/v) Glc or 200 mm mannitol. Cotyledon greening or primary root length was examined after 10 d. For growth measurements of three UGT mutant plants, seeds were sown on 1/2 MS plates supplemented with 125 mm NaCl, and the primary root length was examined after 10 d. To measure relative water loss, the aerial part of plants grown on 1/2 MS plates for 2 weeks was excised and exposed to the dehydration condition for different periods of time. The weight of plant tissues was measured at different time points. For the dehydration stress experiments, 3-week-old plants grown on soil under normal watering conditions were kept in a greenhouse without watering for 10 d. Survival rates were quantified 2 d after rewatering. For the cold stress experiments, 3-week-old plants grown on 1/2 MS plates were incubated at 4°C for different periods of time. To generate the UGT71B6:GFP, UGT71B7:GFP, UGT71B8:GFP, and UGT73B1:GFP constructs, the complementary DNAs (cDNAs) of UGT71B6, UGT71B7, UGT71B8, and UGT73B1 were amplified from a Col-0 flower cDNA library by PCR using the gene-specific primers 71B6-5 and 71B6-3, 71B7-5 and 71B7-3, 71B8-5 and 71B8-3, and 73B1-5 and 73B1-3, respectively (for nucleotide sequences of the primers, see Supplemental Table S1), and fused to GFP of the 326-GFP vector driven by the 35S promoter (CITATION). These constructs were transferred to the binary vector pCsV1300 (Invitrogen) containing the strong cassava vein mosaic virus promoter. The nucleotide sequences of all PCR products were confirmed by sequencing. To generate the UGT RNAi construct, a 450-bp highly conserved region of the three UGTs was used. Fragments I and II were amplified by PCR using primers UGT RNAi-5 and UGT RNAi-3 and UGT RNAi-5′ and UGT RNAi-3′, respectively, and the products were inserted into the RNAi vector pHANNIBAL using BamHI and ClaI sites for fragment I and XhoI and KpnI sites for fragment II (CITATION). To generate Dex-inducible transgenic plants, the fragment was inserted into the binary vector pTA7002 using XhoI and SpeI sites. To generate UGT71B6p:GUS, UGT71B7p:GUS, and UGT71B8p:GUS constructs, the 441-, 1,833-, and 2,744-bp fragments of the UGT71B6, UGT71B7, and UGT71B8 promoter regions were amplified from Col-0 genomic DNA by PCR using the gene-specific primers 71B6-p5 and 71B6-p3, 71B7-p5 and 71B7-p3, and 71B8-p5 and 71B8-p3, respectively, and placed in front of the GUS coding region of the binary vector pCAMBIA3301-Bar. Genomic DNA was prepared from the transfer DNA insertion lines of ugt71b6 (SALK_001713C), ugt71b7 (SALK_027837C), and ugt71b8 (SAIL_75_A08), which were obtained from the Arabidopsis Biological Resource Center. Genotyping was performed using primers UGT71B6-LP and UGT71B6-RP for ugt71b6, UGT71B7-LP and UGT71B7-RP for ugt71b7, and UGT71B8-LP and UGT71B8-RP for ugt71b8. Total RNA was isolated from leaf tissues of the three ugt mutant plants, and the transcript levels of UGT71B6, UGT71B7, and UGT71B8 were determined by reverse transcription-PCR using the gene-specific primers 71B6-t5 and 71B6-t3 for UGT71B6, 71B7-t5 and 71B7-t3 for UGT71B7, and 71B8-t5 and 71B8-t3 for UGT71B8. As a control, 18S ribosomal RNA levels were determined using primers 18S-5 and 18S-3. To generate UGT71B6-, UGT71B7-, and UGT71B8-overexpressing transgenic plants, the UGT71B6:GFP, UGT71B7:GFP, and UGT71B8:GFP binary vector constructs were introduced into wild-type plants according to a published protocol (CITATION). To generate transgenic atbg1 plants that harbored UGT71B6:GFP, the UGT71B6:GFP binary vector construct was introduced into atbg1 mutants. To generate UGT RNAi plants, the RNAi binary vector construct was introduced into wild-type plants. pTA7002, the empty vector, was introduced into wild-type plants as a control. These transgenic plants were screened on 1/2 MS plates supplemented with 25 mg L−1 hygromycin. To generate UGT71B6p:GUS, UGT71B7p:GUS, and UGT71B8p:GUS transgenic plants, UGT71B6p:GUS, UGT71B7p:GUS, and UGT71B8p:GUS binary vector constructs were introduced into wild-type plants. Transgenic plants were screened on 1/2 MS plates supplemented with 25 mg L−1 dl-phosphinothricin. A suitable amount of plasmids expressing effectors, reporter, and normalizer were cotransformed into protoplasts derived from wild-type plants using the polyethylene glycol transformation method (CITATION) and incubated for 20 h at room temperature, and total RNA was extracted from the transformed protoplasts. The transcript levels of LUC were detected by qRT-PCR. GUS was used as an internal control. Primers were as follows: LUC-5 and LUC-3 for LUC and GUS-5 and GUS-3 for GUS. To measure the germination rate, seeds were harvested and stored under identical conditions. Seeds were surface sterilized, stored at 4°C in the dark for 48 h, planted on 1/2 MS plates containing 1% (w/v) Suc and 0.8% (w/v) agar, and germinated at 22°C in a 16-h/8-h light/dark condition. For ABA or NaCl treatments, the appropriate amounts of ABA or NaCl were supplemented to the 1/2 MS medium. Total RNA was extracted from plants using the Qiagen RNeasy Plant Mini Kit and digested with TURBO DNase (Ambion). Extracted RNA was reverse transcribed to cDNA using the High Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit (Applied Biosystems). qRT-PCR was performed using the SYBR Green Kit (Applied Biosystems) to detect transcript levels of genes. ACTIN2 (ACT2) was used as an internal control. Primers used were as follows: 71B6-q5 and 71B6-q3 for UGT71B6, 71B7-q5 and 71B7-q3 for UGT71B7, 71B8-q5 and 71B8-q3 for UGT71B8, 73B1-q5 and 73B1-q3 for UGT73B1, ACT2-5 and ACT2-3 for ACT2, RD29A-5 and RD29A-3 for RD29A, RD29B-5 and RD29B-3 for RD29B, COR47-5 and COR47-3 for COR47, RAB18-5 and RAB18-3 for RAB18, CYP707A1-5 and CYP707A1-3 for CYP707A1, CYP707A2-5 and CYP707A2-3 for CYP707A2, CYP707A3-5 and CYP707A3-3 for CYP707A3, CYP707A4-5 and CYP707A4-3 for CYP707A4, BG1-5 and BG1-3 for AtBG1, BG2-5 and BG2-3 for AtBG2, ARR6-5 and ARR6-3 for ARR6, and ARR15-5 and ARR15-3 for ARR15. To investigate the subcellular localization of the three UGTs, protoplasts were isolated from transgenic plants expressing UGT71B6:GFP, UGT71B7:GFP, and UGT71B8:GFP. The localization was examined by fluorescence microscopy (CITATION). Images were processed using Adobe Photoshop and presented in pseudocolor. Protoplasts were isolated from transgenic plants expressing UGT71B6:GFP, UGT71B7:GFP, and UGT71B8:GFP and suspended in sonication buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm EGTA, 1 mm EDTA, and 160 mm NaCl). Protoplasts were disrupted by sonication. After discarding debris, the soluble fractions were subjected to ultracentrifugation at 100,000g for 1 h. Proteins from soluble and pellet fractions were collected separately and analyzed by immunoblotting using anti-GFP antibody. Total protein extracts from protoplasts were included. As a control for the fractionation, AALP was detected using anti-AALP antibody. Whole-plant tissues (50 mg) were extracted with 80% (v/v) methanol at 4°C for 3 h. The methanol extracts were centrifuged at 3,000g for 10 min to remove debris and dried under vacuum. The powder was dissolved in 50 μL of 1× Tris-buffered saline buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, 100 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm MgCl2, and 0.3% [w/v] NaN3). The ABA content was determined by competitive ELISA using an anti-ABA antibody according to the protocol of the Phytodetek ABA Test Kit (Agdia). Chlorophyll was extracted from leaf tissues of 2-week-old plants using 50 volumes of 95% (v/v) ethanol for 20 min at 80°C. The amount of chlorophyll was calculated as described previously (CITATION). Two-week-old UGT71B6p:GUS, UGT71B7p:GUS, and UGT71B8p:GUS seedlings were treated with or without 100 μm ABA or dehydration stress for 3 h. Histochemical assay of the GUS activity was conducted as follows. Plant materials were incubated in the staining buffer [100 mm NaPO4, pH 7.0, 5 mm K3Fe(CN)6, 5 mm K4Fe(CN)6, 10 mm EDTA, 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100, and 1 mg mL−1 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-D-galactopyranoside] at 37°C in the dark for 6 h. The tissue was then rinsed several times with 70% (v/v) ethanol. The samples were examined with an anatomical microscope.
