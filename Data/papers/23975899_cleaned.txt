!~ABS~! Clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME) regulates many aspects of plant development, including hormone signaling and responses to environmental stresses. Despite the importance of this process, the machinery that regulates CME in plants is largely unknown. In mammals, the heterotetrameric ADAPTOR PROTEIN COMPLEX-2 (AP-2) is required for the formation of clathrin-coated vesicles at the plasma membrane (PM). Although the existence of AP-2 has been predicted in Arabidopsis thaliana, the biochemistry and functionality of the complex is still uncharacterized. Here, we identified all the subunits of the Arabidopsis AP-2 by tandem affinity purification and found that one of the large AP-2 subunits, AP2A1, localized at the PM and interacted with clathrin. Furthermore, endocytosis of the leucine-rich repeat receptor kinase, BRASSINOSTEROID INSENSITIVE1 (BRI1), was shown to depend on AP-2. Knockdown of the two Arabidopsis AP2A genes or overexpression of a dominant-negative version of the medium AP-2 subunit, AP2M, impaired BRI1 endocytosis and enhanced the brassinosteroid signaling. Our data reveal that the CME machinery in Arabidopsis is evolutionarily conserved and that AP-2 functions in receptor-mediated endocytosis.
!~RES~! Previously, we had shown that a clathrin function was required for the internalization of the BR receptor BRI1 (CITATION). To corroborate this observation, we performed colocalization experiments in epidermal cells of the Arabidopsis root meristem that coexpressed the fusion proteins BRI1–green fluorescent protein (GFP) (CITATION) and CLATHRIN LIGHT CHAIN2 (CLC2)–mCherry (CITATION). In agreement with the reported CME of the receptor (CITATION), BRI1 colocalized with CLC2 at the PM and in CLC2-mCherry–positive endosomes (Figure 1A) that had been found previously to be mainly trans-Golgi network (TGN)/early endosome compartments (CITATION). Additionally, coimmunoprecipitation experiments with Arabidopsis seedlings expressing BRI1-GFP probed with anti–clathrin heavy chain (CHC) antibodies (Figure 1B) revealed that clathrin and BRI1 interacted. The occurrence of BRI1 and clathrin together in the endomembrane system supports the CME model for BRI1 internalization (CITATION). [[FIGURE]] Despite the evidence that BRI1 undergoes CME, studies of this mechanism are limited by the poor knowledge of the CME machinery in plants. As clathrin does not bind PM cargos directly, we speculate that, similar to the mammalian CME model (CITATION; CITATION), the AP-2 complex might mediate this interaction. In support of this hypothesis, AP2A1 (At5g22770), one of the two putative Arabidopsis AP-2 large subunits (CITATION), was used to isolate the AP-2 complex from PSB-D Arabidopsis cell suspension cultures. In TAP experiments, AP2A1 was fused to a G protein and a streptavidin-binding peptide (GS) tag at its C or N terminus (CITATION; CITATION) and was produced under a cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV) 35S promoter in Arabidopsis cell cultures. A complex comprising AP2A1 and five additional proteins was isolated repeatedly and independently of the tag position (Table 1; see Supplemental Figure 1 and Supplemental Table 1 online). Four of the identified proteins, namely, AP1/2B1 (At4g11380), AP1/2B2 (At4g23460), AP2M (At4g46630), and AP2S (At1g47830), had been predicted to be part of the AP-2 complex in Arabidopsis inferred from homology to their mammalian counterparts (CITATION). Additionally, in two of the four purifications, a putative AP2A1 binding protein (At5g65960) was identified as well (Table 1; see Supplemental Figure 1 and Supplemental Table 1 online). The interactions found via the TAP technology were reconfirmed by bimolecular fluorescent complementation (BiFC). The AP-2 subunits were fused to the C-terminal or N-terminal fragments of the GFP (designated cGFP and nGFP, respectively) and produced transiently in the leaf epidermis of Nicotiana benthamiana. The combined transformation of AP1/2B1-nGFP and cGFP-AP2A1, AP1/2B1-cGFP and nGFP-AP2S, or AP1/2B1-cGFP and nGFP-AP2M resulted in fluorescent signals at the PM (Figure 2A), indicating that the two proteins interacted, whereas no interaction was found between AP2A1 and AP2S or between AP2A1 and AP2M in any of the combinations tested (see Supplemental Table 2 and Supplemental Figure 2 online). [[FIGURE]] In mammals, AP-2 functions in conjunction with clathrin (CITATION). As none of the clathrin isoforms were retrieved in the TAP experiments, we tested whether AP-2 interacted with clathrin in vivo by performing coimmunoprecipitation experiments in Arabidopsis seedlings expressing CLC2-GFP (CITATION). Protein gel blot analysis with an antibody directed against the two AP2A proteins (CITATION) revealed that AP2A coimmunoprecipitated with CLC2-GFP (Figure 2B). Additional BiFC experiments validated that AP2A1 and clathrin (CLC2 and CHC) interacted with a GFP signal localized at the PM, in agreement with the coimmunoprecipitation data (Figure 2C; see Supplemental Table 2 and Supplemental Figure 2 online). In summary, the biochemical experiments confirm the predicted composition of the AP-2 core complex (Figure 2D; CITATION) in Arabidopsis and directly link this complex with clathrin, reinforcing the hypothesis that AP-2 is part of the CME machinery in plants. In mammals, AP-2 mediates endocytosis from the PM (CITATION). To assess where AP-2 functions in the cell, we studied the AP-2 localization in Arabidopsis plants stably transformed with the large subunit AP2A1 fused to GFP under the control of the CaMV 35S promoter. Confocal microscopy imaging of epidermal cells of the Arabidopsis root meristem revealed that, besides a faint cytoplasmic distribution, both the C- and N-terminal AP2A1-GFP fusions mostly localized at the PM in a discontinuous fashion (Figure 3A; see Supplemental Figure 3 online). To exclude the possibility that the cellular localization of AP2A1-GFP was influenced by the fusion protein levels, we selected two independent transgenic lines (2-1 and 4-1) and analyzed the transcription of the transgene by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). In both lines, the AP2A1-GFP expression was slightly higher or comparable to that of the endogenous AP2A1 gene, namely, 0.75- and 0.42-fold for lines 2-1 and 4-1, respectively (see Supplemental Figure 3 online). The intact AP2A1-GFP fusion protein was also detected in both lines via protein gel blot analysis after immunoprecipitation with anti-GFP antibodies (see Supplemental Figure 3 online). Only the AP2A1-GFP line 2-1 was used hereafter. AP2A1-GFP colocalized with the lypophilic dye N-(3-triethylammoniumpropyl)-4-(6-(4-(diethylamino) phenyl) hexatrienyl) pyridinium dibromide (FM4-64) and CLC2-mCherry (Figures 3A and 3B) at the PM, but AP2A1 was found neither in CLC2-positive endosomes nor in FM4-64–stained endosomal compartments (Figures 3A and 3B). [[FIGURE]] Next, we investigated the possible role of AP-2 in endocytosis by interfering with several of its subunits through both pharmacological and genetic approaches. Pharmacological inhibitors of endocytosis (CITATION; CITATION), such as Wortmannin, Tyrphostin A23, and, to a minor extent, Brefeldin A (BFA), dislodged AP2A1-GFP from the PM in epidermal cells of Arabidopsis roots (Figure 3C; see Supplemental Figure 3 online), implying that the AP2A1-GFP localization at this compartment is required for endocytosis. Washout experiments restored the recruitment of AP2A1-GFP, indicating that the treatments did not interfere with the cell viability (Figure 3C). To assess whether AP-2 functions in endocytosis, we generated a genetic knockdown of AP2A by constitutively expressing an RNA interference (RNAi) construct (AP2A-RNAi) that targeted the two Arabidopsis tandem-duplicated genes encoding AP2A, AP2A1 (At5g22770), and AP2A2 (At5g22780) (CITATION) (see Supplemental Figure 4 online). Additionally, a dominant-negative version of the medium AP2M subunit, designated AP2MΔC, was generated by deleting the C-terminal region responsible for the cargo binding (CITATION). The AP2MΔC construct was expressed in Arabidopsis under an inducible promoter. In 7-d-old Arabidopsis seedlings that constitutively or conditionally expressed the AP2A-RNAi or the AP2MΔC, respectively, the main root was shorter than that of the wild type (see Supplemental Figure 4 online). Both AP-2 knockdown lines had a decreased uptake of the endocytic tracer FM4-64 in root epidermal cells analyzed by the number of FM4-64–labeled endosomes (Figures 4A and 4B). The dominant-negative effect of AP2MΔC expression was not limited to FM4-64 because the clathrin-dependent accumulation of another PM cargo, the auxin transporter PIN-FORMED2 (PIN2), in BFA bodies was also reduced in the AP2MΔC lines (see Supplemental Figure 5 online). In summary, the endocytic defects observed after targeting of the functionality of different AP-2 subunits strongly suggests that this complex plays a general role in endocytic events in plants. [[FIGURE]] Given the role played by AP-2 in the CME of PM receptor cargos in mammals (CITATION) and the similarities between the Arabidopsis AP-2 and its mammalian counterpart, we evaluated whether AP-2 mediated the endocytosis of BRI1. BRI1-GFP colocalized with AP2A1-mTagRFP (see Supplemental Figure 3 online) at the PM (Figure 5A) in agreement with the reported receptor CME (CITATION). Interaction between AP2A and BRI1 was also detected by coimmunoprecipitation in Arabidopsis seedlings expressing BRI1-GFP, as revealed by protein gel blot analysis with an anti-AP2A antibody (CITATION) (Figure 5B). Similarly, BRI1 and AP2A were coimmunoprecipitated in the presence of either brassinolide (BL) (100 nM, 1 h) or after incubation of the BRI1-GFP–expressing plants with the BR synthesis inhibitor brassinazole (2 µM, 24 h) to deplete the endogenous ligand (see Supplemental Figure 6 online). Pretreatment with brassinazole (2 µM, 24 h) followed by application of BL (100 nM, 1 h) to activate the PM pool of BRI1 only led to similar results (see Supplemental Figure 6 online). Likewise, the interaction between BRI1 and CHC was not influenced by the availability of BRs (see Supplemental Figure 6 online). Thus, the recruitment of BRI1 into AP-2/clathrin-mediated endocytic processes is independent of its activation status. [[FIGURE]] The interaction between BRI1 and AP2A strongly implied an AP-2–dependent internalization of BRI1. As the BRI1 endocytosis can be followed by the internalization of fluorescently labeled BR Alexa Fluor castasterone (AFCS) (CITATION), we analyzed the uptake of AFCS in root epidermal cells of Arabidopsis seedlings that expressed either the AP2MΔC or the AP2A-RNAi constructs, by quantifying the vacuolar accumulation of the dye after a chase of 20 min (CITATION; Figure 5C; see Supplemental Figure 7 online). AFCS endocytosis was 45% lower in AP2MΔC-expressing cells than that in the control (Figure 5C). Similarly, the constitutive expression of AP2A-RNAi decreased the uptake of AFCS to 50% of the wild-type levels (Figure 5D), suggesting that a functional AP-2 is required for the BRI1 CME. These results were corroborated by introducing the dominant-negative AP2MΔC construct into BRI1-GFP–expressing Arabidopsis plants and monitoring the BRI1 endocytosis in the presence of the recycling inhibitor BFA. Inducible expression of AP2MΔC partially decreased the endosomal pool of BRI1-GFP in epidermal cells of Arabidopsis roots (Figure 5E) and significantly reduced the size of the BRI1-GFP–labeled BFA bodies, denoting an impaired protein trafficking from the PM (Figure 5F). In plants, endocytosis of PM receptors has been linked to the regulation of their signaling activity (CITATION). Previously, inhibition of BRI1 endocytosis at the PM had been shown to enhance BR signaling, monitored by the phosphorylation status of the key BR transcription factor BRI1-EMS-SUPPRESSOR1 (BES1)/BRASSINAZOLE RESISTANT2 (BZR2) (CITATION). Protein gel blot analysis of total protein extracts of excised Arabidopsis roots after induction of AP2MΔC expression revealed that BES1/BZR2 was dephosphorylated (Figure 5G), hinting at an enhanced BR signaling. This result was validated by a qRT-PCR analysis of the expression of the BR-regulated genes DWARF4 (DWF4) and EXPANSINA8 (EXPA8), both identified as direct targets of the transcription factors BZR1 and/or BES1/BZR2 (CITATION; CITATION). As expected, upon BR signaling activation, DWF4 and EXPA8 were downregulated and upregulated, respectively, after induction of AP2MΔC (see Supplemental Figure 8 online). Taken together, our data show that AP-2 associates with BRI1 and regulates its endocytosis, consequently regulating the signaling output of the receptor.
!~MM~! Arabidopsis thaliana (accession Columbia-0 [Col-0]) seedlings were stratified for 2 d at 4°C and germinated on vertical agar plates with half-strength Murashige and Skoog (1/2MS) medium with 1% (w/v) Suc at 22°C in a 16-h/8-h light/dark cycle for 4 d. Liquid 1/2MS medium was used for all assays and treatments. BRI1-GFP (CITATION) and CLC2-GFP (CITATION) were described previously. BRI1-GFP/AP2MΔC and BRI1-GFP/AP2A1-mTagRFP plants were generated by floral dip (CITATION) in a BRI1-GFP background (CITATION). BRI1-GFP/CLC2-mCherry and AP2A1-GFP/CLC2-mCherry lines were generated by crossing CLC2-mCherry into BRI1-GFP and into AP2A1-GFP, respectively, and selected by antibiotic resistance and fluorescent signals. For induction of estradiol-inducible constructs, seedlings were germinated on 1/2MS plates and transferred to 1/2MS plates containing 5 µM estradiol (Sigma-Aldrich) 4 d after germination. Expression of dominant-negative AP2M was checked by qRT-PCR with primers listed in Supplemental Table 3 online. For AP2A-RNAi–expressing lines, the effective blocking of AP2A1 and AP2A2 expression was monitored by qRT-PCR using primers directed against both transcripts. The expression levels were normalized to the expression of the elongation factor EEF1α4 (At5g60390) (see Supplemental Table 3 online). The AP2A1 (At5g22770), AP1/2B1 (At4g11380), AP2M (At4g46630), and AP2S (At1g47830) subunits were amplified from cDNA clones obtained from the ABRC by PCR with KaPaHIFI polymerase (Sopachem) and added to the Gateway system–compatible attB sites (Invitrogen). To generate transgenic plants with both AP2A1 (At5g22770) and AP2A2 (At5g22780) genes suppressed simultaneously, an RNAi construct was designed using a DNA fragment with the nucleotide positions 150 to 699 of AP2A1 that shows an identical sequence to the corresponding regions of the two AP2A genes. The DNA fragment was isolated by PCR with primers aRNAi-5′ and aRNAi-3′ and inserted into the pENTER vector with the XhoI and Acc65I restriction sites and subsequently transferred to pHellgate8 via LR clonase (Invitrogen) to generate the pHellsgate-a-RNAi construction. The AP2MΔC was cloned into pMDC7 (CITATION). AP2A1 was cloned into pKCTAP and pKNTAP as described previously (CITATION) and in pKFGW2 or pKGWF2 (CITATION) to generate the 35Spro:AP2A1-GFP and 35Spro:GFP-AP2A1 constructs, respectively. The RPS5Apro:AP2A1-mTagRFP construct was generated by recombining pENL1-L2AP2A1, pENL4-L1r-pRPS5A, pENRp2rp2-mTagRFP, and pB7m34GW (CITATION). Gateway technology (Invitrogen) was used for cloning. The BiFC constructs of AP2A1, AP1/2B1, AP2M, AP2S, CHC, and CLC2 were generated as described by CITATION and CITATION. cGFP or nGFP (CITATION) were amplified from pKFGW2 by PCR with KaPaHIFI polymerase (Sopachem) added to the Gateway system–compatible attB sites (Invitrogen) and recombined into pDONR221. Expression clones were generated in the pH2GW7 and pK2GW7 destination vectors (CITATION). Cloning of transgenes encoding tag fusions under the control of the constitutive CaMV 35S promoter and transformation of Arabidopsis cell suspension cultures were performed as previously described (CITATION). TAP experiments of protein complexes were done with the GS tag (CITATION), followed by protein precipitation and separation, according to CITATION. For the protocols of proteolysis and peptide isolation, acquisition of mass spectra by a 4800 Proteomics Analyzer (Applied Biosystems), and mass spectrometry–based protein homology identification from the genomic database of The Arabidopsis Information Resource, we refer to CITATION. Experimental background proteins were subtracted based on ∼40 TAP experiments on wild-type cultures and cultures expressing the TAP-tagged mock proteins β-glucuronidase, red fluorescent protein (RFP), and GFP (CITATION) (see Supplemental Methods 1 online). Agrobacterium tumefaciens–mediated transient transformation of Nicotiana benthamiana leaves and imaging for BiFC experiments were done as described (CITATION) with minor modifications. In brief, Agrobacterium strains transformed with the BiFC constructs were grown for 2 d in yeast extract broth medium, resuspended in infiltration buffer (0.5 mM MES, 1 mM MgCl2, and 100 μM acetosyringone) at the final optical density at 600 nm (OD600) value of 1. Prior to the leaf infiltration, 300 mL of each bacterial culture was mixed for a total volume of 900 mL and infiltrated into leaves of 4-week-old N. benthamiana plants. Leaves were imaged and processed for qRT-PCR 4 d after infiltration. The background levels of autofluorescence used to set the GFP signal threshold level were acquired in N. benthamiana leaves coexpressing the nontagged cGFP and nGFP constructs. Look-up table and laser power were set to exclude fluorescent signals equal or lower than the threshold. Combinations were scored as positive interactions when the GFP signal was above the threshold. Ten-day-old plants expressing BRI1-GFP or CLC2-GFP were treated for 1 h with 100 nM BL in liquid 1/2MS medium. Seedlings were homogenized in liquid nitrogen and extracted in a subcellular extraction buffer (SEB; 250 mM Suc, 20 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 10 mM KCl, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM EGTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% Na-deoxycholate, 100 mM DTT, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, EDTA-free protease inhibitor cocktail complete [Roche], and phosphatase inhibitors [Phospho-STOP; Roche]; adapted from http://www.abcam.com/index.html?pageconfig=resource&rid=11385). Proteins were quantified by the Bradford method (Bio-Rad) of which 3 mg at a concentration of 5 mg/mL was incubated with 5 μL of washed, SEB-equilibrated GFP-Trap beads (ChromoTek) for 4 h at 4°C. Beads were washed four times in SEB, resuspended, and boiled in loading buffer. Half the beads and 15 μL of the input fraction, equivalent to 20% of the protein incubated with the beads, were separated on 7% NuPAGE gels (Invitrogen), blotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, blocked (with 3% skimmed milk powder in Tris-buffered saline), and detected with rabbit polyclonal anti-AP2A antibodies (1:1000) (CITATION), horseradish peroxidase (HRP)–conjugated anti-rabbit secondary antibodies (1:10,000; GE-Healthcare), and HRP-conjugated mouse anti-GFP antibodies (1:40,000; Miltenyi Biotec) via enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL plus; GE-Healthcare). Blots were stripped with 50 mM Gly-HCl, pH 2.5, and 5% SDS for 2 min and reprobed for clathrin with anti-CHC antibodies (1:500; Santa Cruz Biotechnologies) and anti-mouse polyclonal antibodies (NA931V; GE Healthcare). Full scans of the immunoblots are presented (see Supplemental Figure 9 online). Treatments were 100 nM BL (Fuji Chemical Industries), 30 µM Wortmannin, 75 µM Tyrphostin A23, 75 µM Tyrphostin A51, 50 µM BFA, or 2 µM Concanamycin A (Sigma-Aldrich) on 5-d-old seedlings in liquid 1/2MS medium for 1 h before imaging or protein extraction. For expression of estradiol-inducible constructs, 3-d-old seedlings were transferred to agar plates with 1/2MS medium containing 10 µM β-estradiol (Sigma-Aldrich) and analyzed after 2 d. For BES1 dephosphorylation studies, roots from 7-d-old Arabidopsis seedlings were homogenized in liquid nitrogen. Total proteins were extracted (20 mM Tris-HCl, 150 mM NaCl, 1% SDS, 100 mM DTT, and EDTA-free protease inhibitor cocktail complete [Roche]) and quantified with the Quick start Bradford protein assay (1× Bradford dye reagent) (Bio-Rad). Proteins (35 μg) were separated on 10% SDS-PAGE gels and blotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes using the iBlot system (Invitrogen). For blocking and antibody dilutions, 3% skimmed milk powder in Tris-buffered saline was used. BES1 was detected with rabbit polyclonal anti-BES1 antibodies10 (1:1000) and HRP-conjugated anti-rabbit antibodies (1:10,000; GE Healthcare). Signals were detected with ECL plus (GE-Healthcare). Full scans of the immunoblots are presented (see Supplemental Figure 7 online). N. benthamiana leaves and Arabidopsis seedlings were imaged on a confocal laser scanning microscope (FluoView 1000; Olympus) with a 60× water immersion lens (numerical aperture of 1.2) at digital zoom 3. AFCS was taken up as described previously (CITATION). In brief, five 4-d-old seedlings were dipped in a 200-μL droplet of ligand. Seedlings were pulsed for 30 min and washed three times for 10 s and chased for 10 or 20 additional min. Washing and chasing steps were done with 1/2MS medium. To measure the fluorescence signals in vacuoles, stacks of a minimum of four 2.5-μm slices were obtained covering more than 10 μm of the epidermal cells. Four slices covering the epidermal cell layer were merged with maximum projection. The signal intensity of the elliptical region of interest was quantified with ImageJ (http://rsbweb.nih.gov/ij/) and normalized to the area. Immunodetection was done as described (CITATION) with the antibodies anti-PIN2 (1:1000) (CITATION) and anti-rabbit-Cy3 (1:600; Sigma-Aldrich). Full-size confocal pictures are presented (see Supplemental Figure 10 online). Total RNA was extracted from 20 5-d-old Arabidopsis seedlings or from N. benthamiana leaves transiently expressing different BiFC constructs with the RNeasy kit (Qiagen). Total RNA (1 µg) was used for preparation of cDNA (iScript cDNA synthesis kit) according to the manufacturer's protocol (Bio-Rad) and diluted 10 times. qRT-PCR analysis of GFP, DWF4, EXPA8, AP2M, AP2A1, and AP2A2 genes was done with SYBR® Green I Master kit (Roche Diagnostics) on a LightCycler 480 (Roche Diagnostics) with the primers listed in Supplemental Table 3 online. Normalization was done against the average cycle threshold value of the housekeeping gene EF1BB (At1G30230). “Ct” refers to the number of cycles at which SYBR® Green fluorescence reaches an arbitrary value during the exponential phase of the cDNA amplification. Each run contained three technical repeats per sample, and experiments were repeated in two biological replicates, except for the tobacco infiltration experiment where three technical repeats were used. Graphs in figures represent one biological repeat.
