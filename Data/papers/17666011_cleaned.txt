!~ABS~! Arginine methylation of histone H3 and H4 plays important roles in transcriptional regulation in eukaryotes such as yeasts, fruitflies, nematode worms, fish and mammals; however, less is known in plants. In the present paper, we report the identification and characterization of two Arabidopsis thaliana protein arginine N-methyltransferases, AtPRMT1a and AtPRMT1b, which exhibit high homology with human PRMT1. Both AtPRMT1a and AtPRMT1b methylated histone H4, H2A, and myelin basic protein in vitro. Site-directed mutagenesis of the third arginine (R3) on the N-terminus of histone H4 to lysine (H4R3N) completely abolished the methylation of histone H4. When fused to GFP (green fluorescent protein), both methyltransferases localized to the cytoplasm as well as to the nucleus. Consistent with their subcellular distribution, GST (glutathione transferase) pull-down assays revealed an interaction between the two methyltransferases, suggesting that both proteins may act together in a functional unit. In addition, we demonstrated that AtFib2 (Arabidopsis thaliana fibrillarin 2), an RNA methyltransferase, is a potential substrate for AtPRMT1a and AtPRMT1b, and, furthermore, uncovered a direct interaction between the protein methyltransferase and the RNA methyltransferase. Taken together, our findings implicate AtPRMT1a and AtPRMT1b as H4-R3 protein arginine N-methyltransferases in Arabidopsis and may be involved in diverse biological processes inside and outside the nucleus.
!~RES~! Using BLAST searches, with the amino acid sequence of the hPRMT1 variant 2 (PRMT1-v2) as a query, we identified two proteins, AtPRMT1a and AtPRMT1b, with the closest sequence homology with human PRMT1-v2. These two proteins bear 58 and 56% sequence identity with human PRMT1-v2 respectively, and share 78% identity with and 87% similarity to each other. Amino acid sequences of PRMT1s from Arabidopsis (AtPRMT1a and AtPRMT1b), yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae HMT1), Drosophila [DART1 (Drosophila arginine methyltransferase 1)] and human (hPRMT1) were aligned for comparison (Figure 1). Strong conservation was observed particularly within the characteristic SAM-dependent methyltransferase motifs I, post-I, II and III, as well as the ‘double E’ loop and THW (Thr-His-Trp) loop throughout the PRMT family. Major variations were presented in the N-terminus, which may reflect their unique substrate specificities. [[FIGURE]] Results from bioinformatics analysis prompted us to examine whether AtPRMT1a and AtPRMT1b contain intrinsic PRMT activities. GST–AtPRMT1a and GST–AtPRMT1b fusion proteins were expressed in E. coli and were affinity-purified using glutathione–Sepharose beads. GST was affinity-purified as a negative control. The matrix-bound GST, and GST–AtPRMT1a and GST–AtPRMT1b fusion proteins were then subjected to a methyltransferase assay in the presence of the methyl donor [3H]SAM and the indicated substrates: core histones from calf thymus, oligonucleosomes purified from HeLa cells and myelin basic protein, which was widely used as substrate in arginine methyltransferase assays. After enzymatic reactions, the mixtures were separated by SDS/PAGE (Figures 2A and 2B, upper panels) and visualized by fluorography (Figures 2A and 2B, lower panels). Histone H4 and myelin basic protein were radioactively labelled by GST–AtPRMT1a and GST–AtPRMT1b only, but not by the GST control. In addition, histone H2A was also methylated, albeit to a lower extent compared with histone H4, as reported previously [CITATION] (Figures 2A and 2B, lower panels). Oligonucleosomes were not methylated in this assay, indicating that other cofactors or a proper conformation may be necessary. Next, we sought to map which sites were subjected to methylation by AtPRMT1a and AtPRMT1b. There are nine arginine residues in the N-terminus of histone H4 (amino acids 1–54, H4N1–54) and R3 is, so far, the only residue on histone H4 reported to be methylated by PRMT1. In this regard, two forms of recombinant substrates were generated: GST fused to the N-terminal peptide covering amino acids 1–54 of histone H4 (GST–H4R3N1–54) and its derivative bearing a mutation at the third arginine to lysine (GST–H4K3N1–54) respectively. Recombinant GST–AtPRMT1a and GST–AtPRMT1b were then incubated with GST–H4R3N1–54 and the mutated form of GST–H4K3N1–54 in the presence of [3H]SAM. Fluorography results showed that GST–H4R3N1–54 was methylated by GST–AtPRMT1a (Figure 2C) and GST–AtPRMT1b (Figure 2D), whereas GST–H4K3N1–54 completely lost its ability to be methylated (Figures 2C and 2D). This result indicated that R3 is the only arginine residue in the N-terminus of histone H4 methylated by AtPRMT1a and AtPRMT1b in vitro. [[FIGURE]] To determine whether endogenous histone H4 is methylated at R3, total histones from Arabidopsis were isolated, and the methylation status of H4-R3 was analysed by Western blotting using anti-(asymmetric dimethyl-H4R3) (anti-H4R3ame2) antibodies. The antibody recognized histone H4 isolated from Arabidopsis well (Figure 3, lane 4, upper panel), but did not recognize recombinant histone H4 expressed in E. coli, which was free from any post-translational modifications (Figure 3, lane 1, upper panel), demonstrating the in vivo occurrence of H4-R3 methylation. As positive controls, calf thymus histone H4 (Figure 3, lane 2, upper panel) and AtPRMT1a-methylated calf thymus histone H4 (Figure 3, lane 3, upper panel) were used, and their levels of methylation were also captured by the anti-H4R3ame2 antibody. The same membrane was re-probed with anti-H4 antibody to demonstrate equal levels of loading (Figure 3, lower panel). [[FIGURE]] The substrates of AtPRMT1a and AtPRMT1b varied from nuclear proteins (e.g. histones) to cellular membrane proteins (e.g. myelin basic protein), indicating that AtPRMT1a and AtPRMT1b may function in the both nucleus and cytoplasm. To test this, AtPRMT1a and AtPRMT1b cDNAs were fused in-frame to the 5′-end of GFP under the control of the 35S promoter, and the distribution of these fusion proteins in plant cells was determined by a transient transfection system using onion epidermal cells with particle bombardment. As observed by confocal fluorescence microscopy, GFP-fusion proteins of AtPRMT1a and AtPRMT1b displayed a strong nuclear localization, although lacking the nuclear localization signal. As we had expected, both proteins were also dispersed in the cytoplasm (Figures 4C and 4E), similarly to the pattern observed in onion cells expressing GFP alone (Figure 4A).This result was compatible with recent findings from hPRMT1 [CITATION], suggesting that AtPRMT1a and AtPRMT1b may be involved in multiple cellular processes. [[FIGURE]] The similar biochemical properties and subcellular distribution between AtPRMT1a and AtPRMT1b suggested that both proteins may be involved in similar physiological progresses. Starting from this premise, a GST pull-down experiment was performed using GST–AtPRMT1a as the ‘bait’ to pull-down MBP–AtPRMT1b. A direct interaction was demonstrated between AtPRMT1a and AtPRMT1b, as no other signal was detected by an anti-MBP monoclonal antibody in any of the control lanes (Figure 5). It was reported that dimerization of hPRMT1 was essential for SAM binding and enzymatic activity, and the dimers further formed an extended oligomer as validated by gel-filtration chromatography [CITATION,CITATION]. In this regard, our result suggested that hetero-oligomers consisting of AtPRMT1a and AtPRMT1b might be formed as the functional unit in regulating plant development. [[FIGURE]] A previous study has revealed components of the ribonucleoprotein complex such as the human RNA methyltransferase Fib (fibrillarin) as the in vitro substrate of PRMT1 [CITATION]. In the genome of Arabidopsis, there are two genes that encode nearly identical proteins, AtFib1 and AtFib2, which function as homologues with human Fib [CITATION]. Both AtFib1 and AtFib2 share the conserved GAR (glycine- and arginine-rich) domain, RBD (RNA-binding domain) and the α-helix domain in analogy to their human counterpart (Figure 6A). To determine whether AtFib2 was a substrate of AtPRMT1a and AtPRMT1b, AtFib2 and its N-terminal region containing the GAR domain (AtFib2N1–150, corresponding to amino acids 1–150 of AtFib2) were cloned and expressed as GST-fusion proteins in E. coli. Purified GST–AtFib2 and GST–AtFib2N1–150 were incubated with GST–AtPRMT1a or GST–AtPRMT1b in the presence of [3H]SAM as previously described. The reaction products were separated by SDS/PAGE and visualized by fluorography. As shown in Figure 6(B), both AtFib2 and its N-terminal region AtFib2N1–150 were methylated by AtPRMT1a and AtPRMT1b in vitro, indicating that AtFib2 may be the potential substrate of AtPRMT1. Since GST–AtFib2 fusion protein (approx. 60 kDa) is very sensitive to proteolysis during expression and purification, and is less competitive to acquire [3H]SAM, the level of methylation of full-length GST–AtFib2 is minimal, the major methylated product (degraded fragments of GST–AtFib2) electrophorese as a broad band ranging from 28 to 36 kDa, as reported previously [CITATION]. Other groups' work has also demonstrated the GST–GAR fusion protein or fusion protein containing the GAR domain such as GST–rpS2 (ribosomal protein S2) are very susceptible to degradation [CITATION,CITATION]. These fragments are much more competitive to acquire [3H]SAM than full-length GST–AtFib2, which ultimately results in the minimal level of methylation of full-length GST–AtFib2 (Figure 6B). [[FIGURE]] To determine the type of activity that AtPRMT1a and AtPRMT1b catalyse, GST–AtFib2N1–150 was subjected to Western blotting after a methyltransferase activity assay: the samples were separated by SDS/15% PAGE and transferred on to nitrocellulose membrane and probed with an antibody specific for asymmetrically dimethylated arginine residues (ASYM24, Upstate). The result demonstrated the presence of asymmetric dimethylation on GST–AtFib2N1–150, suggesting AtPRMT1a and AtPRMT1b are Type I arginine methyltransferases (Figure 6C). Since human Fib was reported to associate with a subcomplex containing PRMT5, PRMT1, SF2A-p32 (splicing factor SF2-associated protein p32), tubulin α3 and tubulin β1 [CITATION], we determined to assess whether there existed a direct interaction between AtFib2 and AtPRMT1a/AtPRMT1b. To this end, GST–AtPRMT1a and GST–AtPRMT1b proteins were immobilized on glutathione–Sepharose beads as the ‘bait’, and the MBP–AtFib2 was expressed as the ‘prey’ in GST pull-down assays. As detected by Western blotting using monoclonal antibodies against the MBP tag, MBP–AtFib2 was shown to be captured by GST–AtPRMT1a or GST–AtPRMT1b, but not by the GST control (Figure 6D), indicating that AtFib2 interacted directly with GST–AtPRMT1a and GST–AtPRMT1b in vitro.
!~MM~! Database searching was performed using TBLASTN at NCBI (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST/). Multiple alignments of protein sequences were performed with ClustalX and were manually edited with the GeneDoc program. Full-length coding sequences of AtPRMT1a, AtPRMT1b, AtFib2, the N-terminal region of AtFib2 (AtFib2N1–150, corresponding to nucleotides 1–450 of AtFib2), the N-terminal region of histone H4 (H4R3N1–54, corresponding to nucleotides 1–162 of histone H4) and H4K3N1–54 (R3 mutated into lysine) were amplified by PCR. Primer pairs are listed as follows: CX0127 (5′-CGCGGATCCATGACTAGTACGGAGAACAACAACAAC-3′) and CX0128 (5′-CTCGAATTCTTAGCGCATCTTATAGAAGTGG-3′) for AtPRMT1a; CX0135 (5′-CGCGGATCCATGACTAAGAACAGTAACCACGACGAGAAT-3′) and CX0136 (5′-CTCGAATTCCTTCTGAAGTTCTGCTTCTTATG-3′) for AtPRMT1b; CX0364 (5′-CGCGGATCCATGAGACCTCCTCTAACTGGAAGTGGT-3′) and CX0365 (5′-CTCGAATTCACTTCTAAGCAGCAGTAGCAGC-3′) for AtFib2; CX0364 (5′-CGCGGATCCATGAGACCTCCTCTAACTGGAAGTGGT-3′) and CX0765 (5′-CTCGAATTCAGATGTTATCAACACCACCAAGA-3′) for AtFib2N1–150; CX0348 (5′-CGCGGATCCATGTCTGGGCGAGGTAAAGGTGGCAAG-3′) and CX0171 (5′-CTCGAATTCTCACTCCTCGTAGATGAGACCA-3′) for H4R3N1–54; and CX0170 (5′-CGCGGATCCATGTCTGGGAAAGGTAAAGGTGGCA-3′) and CX0171 (5′-CTCGAATTCTCACTCCTCGTAGATGAGACCA-3′) for H4K3N1–54. These PCR fragments were digested further and cloned in-frame into the BamHI (GGATCC, underlined) and EcoRI (GAATTC, underlined) sites of pGEX-4T-2 vector (Amersham Biosciences) to generate the GST–AtPRMT1a, GST–AtPRMT1b, GST–AtFib2, GST–AtFib2N1–150, GST–H4R3N1–54 and GST–H4K3N1–54 GST (glutathione transferase) fusion constructs. To generate the GFP–AtPRMT1a and GFP–AtPRMT1b GFP (green fluorescent protein) expression constructs, the GST–AtPRMT1a and GST–AtPRMT1b fusion constructs were digested with EcoRI and the cohesive ends were filled-in using Klenow fragment (NEB), then digested with BamHI. The resulting fragments of AtPRMT1a and AtPRMT1b were subcloned into the pAVA321 vector, which was digested using the same strategy, except for the last step, using BglII digestion instead of BamHI. To generate an MBP (maltose-binding protein)-tagged AtFib2 fusion construct (MBP–AtFib2), fragments of AtFib2 were digested with BamHI and EcoRI from the GST–AtFib2 fusion construct and subcloned into pMal-2×His-TEV vector. To generate the MBP–AtPRMT1b fusion construct, fragments of AtPRMT1b were digested with SmaI and BamHI and reinserted into pMal-2×His-TEV vector. All of the constructs generated above were verified by DNA sequencing. The fusion proteins GST–AtPRMT1a, GST–AtPRMT1b, GST–H4R3N1–54, GST–H4K3N1–54, GST–AtFib2, GST–AtFib2N1–150, and MBP–AtPRMT1a were expressed in Escherichia coli strain BL21(RIL) cells, and MBP–AtFib2 was expressed in E. coli strain BL21(DE3) cells, and all were affinity-purified with glutathione–Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences). In vitro histone methyltransferase assays were performed as described previously [CITATION]. Labelled proteins were separated by SDS/15% PAGE and visualized by autofluorography for 48 h. Approx. 3 g of leaves from 2-week-old Arabidopsis were homogenized in histone extraction buffer [0.25 M sucrose, 60 mM KCl, 15 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM CaCl2, 15 mM Pipes, pH 6.8, 0.8% Triton X-100 and protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche)]. After centrifugation at 10000 g for 20 min, the pellet was resuspended with 0.4 M H2SO4, then centrifuged at 22000 g for 5 min. Then, 12 vol. of acetone were added to the supernatant and left at −20 °C overnight to precipitated proteins. The proteins were then centrifuged at 8000 g for 15 min and resuspended with 4 M urea to a final volume of 100 μl. All steps were carried out at 4 °C unless specified. Recombinant histone H4, calf thymus histones, calf thymus histones methylated by AtPRMT1a and total histones isolated from Arabidopsis were separated by SDS/15% PAGE, transferred on to a PVDF membrane (Millipore) and probed with anti-(asymmetric dimethyl-H4R3) (anti-H4R3ame2) antibodies (Upstate) [1:1000 dilution in TBST (0.1% Tween 20, 150 mM NaCl and 50 mM Tris/HCl, pH 7.5)]. GFP–AtPRMT1a- and GFP–AtPRMT1b-expressing plasmids were transiently expressed in onion epidermal cells as described previously [CITATION]. The inner epidermal layers from fresh onions (obtained from a local market) were placed on MS (Murashige and Shoog) basal medium. A 5 μg amount of plasmids containing the GFP–AtPRMT1a or GFP–AtPRMT1b fusion constructs was precipitated on to gold particles and then bombarded on to the onion epidermal cells. The samples were incubated at 23 °C for 24 h in the dark after bombardment. GFP fluorescence was observed and captured using a confocal microscope (Olympus). Matrix-bound GST-fusion proteins (GST–AtPRMT1a and GST–AtPRMT1b) were incubated with E. coli extracts containing either MBP–AtFib2 or MBP–AtPRMT1b at 4 °C for 2 h with constant gentle mixing. The mixtures were centrifuged at 10000 g for 1 min, and the pellet was washed extensively with modified RIPA buffer (20 mM Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM EDTA, 1% Nonidet P40 and 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, with 1 mM PMSF and 0.5 mM dithiothreitol added immediately before use). After the final wash, the pellet was resuspended in an equal volume of 2× SDS loading buffer and separated by SDS/10% PAGE. Proteins were transferred on to a nitrocellulose membrane (Amersham Biosciences) and were immunodetected by monoclonal antibodies against MBP.
