!~ABS~! The plant hormone jasmonate (JA) activates gene expression by promoting ubiquitin-dependent degradation of jasmonate ZIM domain (JAZ) transcriptional repressor proteins. A key feature of all JAZ proteins is the highly conserved Jas motif, which mediates both JAZ degradation and JAZ binding to the transcription factor MYC2. Rapid expression of JAZ genes in response to JA is thought to attenuate JA responses, but little is known about the mechanisms by which newly synthesized JAZ proteins exert repression in the presence of the hormone. Here, we show in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) that desensitization to JA is mediated by an alternative splice variant (JAZ10.4) of JAZ10 that lacks the Jas motif. Unbiased protein-protein interaction screens identified three related basic helix-loop-helix transcription factors (MYC2, MYC3, and MYC4) and the corepressor NINJA as JAZ10.4-binding partners. We show that the amino-terminal region of JAZ10.4 contains a cryptic MYC2-binding site that resembles the Jas motif and that the ZIM motif of JAZ10.4 functions as a transferable repressor domain whose activity is associated with the recruitment of NINJA. Functional studies showed that the expression of JAZ10.4 from the native JAZ10 promoter complemented the JA-hypersensitive phenotype of a jaz10 mutant. Moreover, treatment of these complemented lines with JA resulted in the rapid accumulation of JAZ10.4 protein. Our results provide an explanation for how the unique domain architecture of JAZ10.4 links transcription factors to a corepressor complex and suggest how JA-induced transcription and alternative splicing of JAZ10 premessenger RNA creates a regulatory circuit to attenuate JA responses.
!~RES~! As an unbiased approach to identify binding partners of JAZ10.4, we performed a high-throughput yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) screen for Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) proteins that interact with JAZ10.4. Sequence information obtained from 295 positive clones (among 3.2 × 107 clones screened) produced a list of putative interacting proteins. Based on calculated confidence scores (CITATION), five proteins were categorized as high-confidence interactors: MYC2, MYC3, MYC4, NINJA, and GENERAL REGULATING FACTOR6 (GRF6, also known as 14-3-3λ/GF14λ; Table I). GRF6 was not identified as a JAZ10.4-interacting protein in planta (see below) and thus was not characterized further. Sequencing of positive clones provided information on the minimal interaction domain of each prey protein (CITATION). The results suggested that JAZ10.4 interacts with the N-terminal region of MYC2, MYC3, and MYC4 and the C-terminal region of NINJA (Table I). These findings are in agreement with previous studies showing that most full-length JAZs (including JAZ10.1) interact with the N terminus of MYC TFs (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION) and that JAZ1 interacts with the C-terminal region of NINJA (CITATION). As an alternative approach to identify JAZ10.4 interacting partners, we used mass spectrometry (MS) to identify proteins that copurify with JAZ10.4 expressed in cultured Arabidopsis T87 cells. The utility of this system for studying JAZ proteins was assessed by an analysis of cell lines expressing yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) fusions of each JAZ10 splice variant. Confocal microscopy and western-blot analysis showed that JAZ10.3-YFP and JAZ10.4-YFP accumulate to higher levels than JAZ10.1-YFP in both control and JA-treated T87 cells (Supplemental Fig. S1). This finding is consistent with previous studies showing that JAZ10.3 and JAZ10.4 are more stable than JAZ10.1 in JA-treated seedlings (CITATION). MS-based analysis of coimmunoprecipitated JAZ10.4-YFP complexes (four independent replicates) identified NINJA as a major copurifying protein (Table II). MYC2, MYC3, and MYC4 were also identified as JAZ10.4-interacting partners in at least two of the four replicate experiments. We also identified JAZ12 and PEAPOD2 (PPD2) as components of the JAZ10.4 complex, which is in agreement with studies showing that JAZs form heteromeric complexes with other ZIM domain-containing proteins (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION). These collective findings show that JAZ10.4 interacts in vivo with NINJA and the basic helix-loop-helix TFs MYC2, MYC3, and MYC4. nd, Not detected. The ability of JAZ10.4 to interact with MYC2 was unexpected, because previous studies have shown that the Jas motif, which is not present in JAZ10.4, is necessary and sufficient for interaction with MYC2 (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION). We used Y2H assays to map the MYC2-interacting domain of JAZ10.4. The strength of the JAZ10.4 interaction with MYC2 in this assay was comparable to that of the Jas motif-containing full-length splice variant, JAZ10.1 (Fig. 1A). Deletion of the ZIM domain abolished JAZ10.4 dimerization but did not affect JAZ10.4 interaction with MYC2, as reported previously (CITATION). However, constructs lacking the N-terminal 47 amino acids (JAZ10.4Δ1-47) or lacking only amino acid residues 16 to 47 (JAZ10.4Δ16-47) failed to bind MYC2. Systematic deletion analysis identified a 43-amino acid fragment (JAZ10.416-58) that is sufficient for MYC2 interaction (Fig. 1B). Interestingly, this cryptic MYC2-interacting domain (CMID) contains a nine-amino acid sequence (FQKFLDRRR) that strongly resembles the core of the Jas motif of JAZ10 and other JAZ proteins, including a tribasic cluster of residues (Fig. 1C). In the Jas motif of JAZ9, the central R residue within the tribasic cluster (Fig. 1C) is essential for interaction with MYC2 (CITATION). [[FIGURE]] To assess whether the tribasic cluster (RRR32-34) in the JAZ10.4 CMID plays a role in MYC2 binding, we mutated each Arg residue, individually and in combination, to an Ala and tested the resulting constructs for interaction with MYC2. Single and double R→A substitutions had no effect on MYC2 binding in yeast. However, substitution of all three residues (RRR→AAA) abolished MYC2 binding but did not affect JAZ10.4 dimerization (Fig. 2A). We also expressed wild-type and mutant (JAZ10.4RRR→AAA) versions of JAZ10.4 in Escherichia coli as maltose-binding protein-JAZ-6xHis fusions and tested these proteins in pull-down assays for their ability to bind a cMyc-tagged derivative of MYC2 expressed in Arabidopsis. The results verified that the RRR32-34 motif of JAZ10.4 is required for MYC2 binding (Fig. 2B). To determine whether the CMID of JAZ10.4 is sufficient for MYC2 binding, we fused the N-terminal 78 amino acids of JAZ10.4 (JAZ101-78) to the C terminus of a JAZ3 derivative (JAZ3∆Jas) that lacks the entire Jas motif and thus does not interact with MYC2 (CITATION). Pull-down assays showed that fusion of JAZ101-78 to the C terminus of JAZ3∆Jas partially restores interaction with MYC2 (Fig. 2C). Introduction of the RRR32-34→AAA mutation into the full-length JAZ10.1 isoform had no effect on MYC2 binding, presumably because JAZ10.1RRR→AAA contains an intact Jas motif (Supplemental Fig. S2). [[FIGURE]] To determine whether the CMID is required for JAZ10.4 function in vivo, we compared JA responses in transgenic lines (35S:JAZ10.4-YFP and 35S:JAZ10.4RRR→AAA-YFP) that overexpress YFP fusions of JAZ10.4 and JAZ10.4RRR→AAA. In agreement with previous studies (CITATION), 24% of all 35S:JAZ10.4-YFP plants tested (n = 73 independent T1 lines) exhibited hallmark characteristics of JA-associated male sterility, including short anther filaments and reduced anther dehiscence (Fig. 3A). Root growth inhibition assays also showed that 35S:JAZ10.4-YFP seedlings were strongly insensitive to JA (Fig. 3B). All 35S:JAZ10.4RRR→AAA-YFP lines (n = 50 independent T1 lines) were fully fertile and showed no signs of JA-associated male sterility. Experiments performed with T3 seedlings that are homozygous for the transgene further showed that the sensitivity of 35S:JAZ10.4RRR→AAA-YFP seedlings to JA is comparable to that of wild-type seedlings (Fig. 3, B and C). Confocal microscopy analysis showed that both JAZ10.4-YFP and JAZ10.4RRR→AAA-YFP localize to the nucleus of trichome cells (Supplemental Fig. S3). JAZ10.4RRR→AAA-YFP also showed nuclear localization in roots, although the signal was more diffuse (presumably cytosolic) than that of JAZ10.4-YFP. This suggests that the inability of JAZ10.4RRR→AAA-YFP to repress JA responses does not result from mislocalization of the JAZ fusion protein. Taken together, the results indicate that the N-terminal region of JAZ10.4 contains a cryptic MYC2-binding site that is required for JAZ10.4-mediated repression of JA responses. [[FIGURE]] The identification of NINJA as a JAZ10.4-interacting protein (Tables I and II) suggests that repression of JA responses by JAZ10.4 involves recruitment of the NINJA-TPL corepressor complex to the ZIM domain of JAZ10.4 (CITATION). To address this question, we tested whether the ZIM domain (residues 104–130) of JAZ10 is capable of conferring repressive activity on a JAZ that binds MYC2 but fails to associate with the NINJA-TPL corepressor complex. We took advantage of the fact that repression of JA responses by JAZ8 does not depend on its ZIM domain but rather relies on an EAR motif at the N terminus of JAZ8 that directly binds TPL. A mutant (JAZ8ΔEAR) of JAZ8 lacking the EAR motif does not interact with TPL and is unable to repress JA responses (Fig. 4A; CITATION). A chimeric protein (JAZ8ΔEAR-ZIM10) in which the ZIM domain of JAZ8ΔEAR was replaced with the ZIM domain of JAZ10 exhibited strong interaction with NINJA in yeast (Fig. 4A). In root growth assays, transgenic lines that express JAZ8ΔEAR-ZIM10 from the 35S promoter exhibited a JA-insensitive phenotype identical to that of JAZ8-overexpressing lines (Fig. 4B). Thus, the ZIM domain of JAZ10 restores repression activity to a JAZ variant (JAZ8ΔEAR) that binds MYC2 but is unable to recruit the corepressor complex. [[FIGURE]] The highly conserved Ile residue (Ile-107 in the TIFY motif) of the ZIM domain is required both for JAZ10.4 dimerization and the repression of JA responses by JAZ10.4 (CITATION). Given that NINJA represses JA responses through its interaction with the ZIM domain of JAZ (CITATION), we tested whether Ile-107 of JAZ10.4 may also be important for interaction with NINJA. Y2H assays showed that, whereas substitution of Ile-107 to Ala eliminates JAZ10.4 dimerization, this mutation reduced but did not abolish JAZ10.4 interaction with NINJA (Fig. 5A). A T106A mutation had no effect on JAZ10.4 binding to either JAZ10.4 or NINJA, suggesting that the effect is specific for Ile-107. In vitro pull-down assays confirmed that I107A eliminates JAZ10.4 dimerization and reduces the extent to which JAZ10.4 interacts with NINJA (Fig. 5, B and C). MS analysis of protein complexes immunopurified from T87 cells provided additional evidence that I107A disrupts the ability of NINJA to copurify with JAZ10.4 (Table II). Based on the number of assigned mass spectra corresponding to NINJA and JAZ10.4, we estimated that the amount of NINJA copurifying with JAZ10.4I107A was less than 20% of that copurifying with wild-type JAZ10.4 (Table II). These findings show that Ile-107 is not only critical for JAZ10.4 dimerization but also suggest a key role for this residue in stabilizing the JAZ10.4-NINJA interaction. [[FIGURE]] To further test the hypothesis that JAZ10.4 participates in a negative feedback loop to restrain JA responses, we tested whether expression of this splice variant from the native JAZ10 promoter is sufficient to attenuate JA responses. For these experiments, we used a 2.0-kb JAZ10 promoter fragment that confers JA-inducible expression of a GUS reporter gene (CITATION). A hemagglutinin (HA) epitope tag was added to the N terminus of JAZ10.4 to facilitate protein detection in plant tissues. The resulting pJAZ10:HA-JAZ10.4 transgene was introduced into the jaz10-1 mutant that is hypersensitive to JA-induced root growth inhibition (CITATION). Of eight lines that were confirmed to contain a single segregating copy of the transgene, all were significantly less sensitive to exogenous methyl jasmonate (MeJA; 20 μm) than jaz10-1 seedlings. Further analysis of five representative pJAZ10:HA-JAZ10.4 lines showed that all but one line (4.1) were also less sensitive than jaz10-1 to 10 μm MeJA (Fig. 6A). On medium containing 20 μm MeJA, root growth of some lines (e.g. 14.4) was significantly less sensitive than that of wild-type seedlings (Fig. 6A). This finding suggests that differences in the expression level of JAZ10.4 between transgenic lines may modulate sensitivity to JA. [[FIGURE]] We used immunoblot analysis to test whether the level of JA-induced accumulation of JAZ10.4 in specific transgenic lines correlates with observed differences in root growth sensitivity to JA. Lines that exhibited either wild-type-like (line 4.1) or reduced (line 14.4) sensitivity to the hormone were grown in liquid Murashige and Skoog medium and treated with 50 μm MeJA. At various times after treatment, seedlings were harvested for western-blot analysis with an anti-HA antibody (Fig. 6B). We detected the accumulation of JAZ10.4 protein in both lines within 1 h of treatment. In the case of line 4.1, JAZ10.4 protein levels steadily increased during the 8-h time course. In the moderately JA-insensitive 14.4 line, however, JA treatment resulted in a much stronger accumulation of JAZ10.4, with protein levels peaking at 2 h and then declining slowly at later time points. These results show that JAZ10.4, when expressed from the native JAZ10 promoter, rapidly accumulates in response to JA treatment and that the strength of JAZ10.4 expression inversely correlates with the level of sensitivity to JA.
!~MM~! Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) plants were grown at 21°C under long-day conditions as described by CITATION. The Columbia ecotype was used as the wild-type genetic background for all experiments. The jaz10-1 mutant (SAIL_92_D08) was obtained from the Arabidopsis Biological Resource Center. The 35S:JAZ8ΔEAR line was described previously by CITATION. JA-mediated root growth inhibition assays were performed as described previously (CITATION; CITATION). JAZ10.4 was used as the bait in a Y2H screen performed by Hybrigenics. A cDNA encoding JAZ10.4 was cloned into pB27 as a C-terminal fusion to LexA (N-LexA-JAZ10.4-C) and subsequently used to screen a random-primed cDNA library prepared from 1-week-old Arabidopsis seedlings. Thirty-two million clones (3.2-fold coverage of the library) were screened using a mating approach with yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) strains HGX13 and L40ΔGal4 as described previously (CITATION). His+ colonies (295 total) were selected on a medium lacking Trp, Leu, and His and supplemented with 0.5 mm 3-aminotriazole to reduce autoactivation by the “bait” protein. cDNA fragments corresponding to positive “prey” clones were amplified by PCR and sequenced at their 5′ and 3′ junctions. The resulting sequences were searched against GenBank and assigned a quality score indicative of the confidence of interaction (CITATION). Only those interactions with the highest confidence values are reported in this paper. All other Y2H assays were performed with the Matchmaker LexA system (Clontech) as described previously (CITATION; CITATION). JAZ10.4 constructs were subcloned into the pGILDA vector to generate translational fusions with the LexA DNA-binding domain. Full-length cDNAs encoding MYC2 and NINJA were subcloned into the pB42AD vector to generate fusions with the B42 activation domain. Various bait-prey pairs were cotransformed into yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) strain EGY48 using the Frozen-EZ Yeast Transformation II kit (Zymo Research). Photographic images of Y2H plates were taken after 1 or 2 d of incubation at 30°C (CITATION). Y2H assays were replicated at least three times. A complete list of primers and constructs used for cloning into pGILDA and pB42AD are described in Supplemental Table S1. All PCRs were performed with KAPA HIFI Polymerase (Kapa Biosystems) following the manufacturer’s instructions. All primer sets used for PCR are listed in Supplemental Table S1. For cloning with Gateway vectors (Invitrogen), PCR amplicons were purified and cloned into pEntr-D-Topo using the pENTR Directional TOPO Cloning Kit (Invitrogen). Sequence-verified clones were transferred to the corresponding destination vector (Supplemental Table S1) using the Gateway LR Clonase II Enzyme Mix (Invitrogen). JAZ10.4 and JAZ10.4RRR→AAA constructs were cloned by Gateway reaction into the pEarley101 destination vector to generate a C-terminal fusion protein with YFP (CITATION). We followed a two-step selection process to obtain lines that express these fusion proteins at relatively high levels. First, transgenic seedlings were screened on Murashige and Skoog agar plates for resistance to kanamycin (50 μg mL−1). Second, a Leica M165FC Fluorescence Stereomicroscope was used to screen the resulting kanamycin-resistant lines for seedlings that accumulate the JAZ-YFP fusion protein in the nucleus. Expression of the N-terminal HA-tagged JAZ10.4 protein from the native JAZ10 promoter was achieved as follows. A 2.0-kb JAZ10 promoter sequence, similar to that described by CITATION, was amplified by PCR using XhoI-predigested T31B5 bacterial artificial chromosome DNA as a template. The JAZ10 promoter was cloned directionally into pEntr-D-Topo (to generate pEntr-JAZ10promoter) using forward and reverse primers carrying NotI restriction sites (Supplemental Table S1). JAZ10.4 cDNA was amplified with a primer set designed to add an HA epitope tag to the N terminus of the protein, and the resulting amplicon was cloned into pEntr-D-Topo (to give pEntr-HA-JAZ10.4). The JAZ10 promoter was released from pEntr-JAZ10promoter using the NotI restriction enzyme and ligated to the NotI-linearized pEntr-HA-JAZ10.4 using the Rapid Ligation Kit (Roche). An LR Clonase (Invitrogen) reaction was used to transfer this construct into the final destination vector, pGWB401 (CITATION). The final construct was confirmed by sequencing and transformed into Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain C58C1 for the generation of transgenic Arabidopsis plants (CITATION). Kanamycin-resistant T1 seedlings were selected on agar plates containing 50 μg mL−1 antibiotic. T2 seedlings were used to select lines containing a single transfer DNA insertion based on a 3:1 segregation ratio of the antibiotic resistance marker. T3 seedlings were used to screen for lines that were homozygous for the transgene. The MYC2 cDNA was PCR amplified using cDNA synthesized from total RNA isolated from rosette leaves of 5-week-old Arabidopsis plants. Oligonucleotide primer sequences are described in Supplemental Table S1. The resulting MYC2 amplicon was cloned into pENTR/D-TOPO (Invitrogen) and transferred into the pJYP006 binary vector to create a vector (35S:Myc-MYC2) in which the N terminus of MYC2 is fused to nine repeats of the c-Myc epitope. This vector was introduced into A. tumefaciens strain GV3100 for transformation of the jin1-9 mutant. T1 plants were grown on soil for 7 d and sprayed with a solution containing 0.3 µm glufosinate (Finale; AgrEvo Environmental Health). T2 plants containing a single transfer DNA insertion (as determined by 3:1 segregation of glufosinate resistance) were used for western-blot analysis to confirm the expression of Myc-MYC2. A homozygous T3 line was used as a source of leaf extracts for in vitro pull-down assays. We used four PCRs to generate the JAZ8ΔEAR-ZIM10 construct. In one reaction, JAZ8ΔEAR cDNA was used as a template with primer set JAZ8-pENTR-FP and JAZ8-ZIM10-N-RP to amplify cDNA encoding the first 44 amino acids of JAZ8ΔEAR. Another reaction also used JAZ8ΔEAR as a template with primer set JAZ8-ZIM10-C-FP and JAZ8-pENTR-RP to amplify cDNA encoding the last 59 amino acids of JAZ8ΔEAR (amino acids 73–131). In the third PCR, the amplicon from the first PCR (JAZ8ΔEAR N-terminal 44 amino acids) and JAZ10.1 cDNA were both used as templates with primer set JAZ8-pENTR-FP and JAZ10-KpnI-RP to generate a JAZ8ΔEAR-JAZ10 chimera. Finally, the JAZ8ΔEAR-JAZ10 chimera and cDNA encoding the last 59 amino acids of JAZ8ΔEAR (amplicon from the second PCR) were used as templates with primer set JAZ8-pENTR-FP and JAZ8-pENTR-RP to generate the final JAZ8ΔEAR-ZIM10 construct. JAZ8ΔEAR-ZIM10 was cloned into vector pENTR-TOPO for sequencing and subcloning. Following A. tumefaciens-mediated transformation, 32 independent T1 plants were transferred to soil and RNA was extracted from leaf tissue. JAZ8ΔEAR-ZIM10 gene-specific primers (JAZ8-pENTR-FP and JAZ8-pENTR-RP) were used in reverse transcription-PCR to confirm expression of the transgene. Ten lines were selected and further propagated for the identification of homozygous T3 lines. Single and multiple amino acid residues within JAZ proteins were substituted to Ala with the Quick-Change II site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene), as described previously (CITATION; CITATION). PCR was performed with Pfu Turbo DNA Polymerase to generate the constructs listed in Supplemental Table S1. pGEM-T vector harboring the wild-type JAZ cDNA was used as a template for mutagenesis. All constructs were sequenced to confirm the corresponding mutation. Cloning, expression, and purification of recombinant JAZ proteins as maltose-binding protein- and hexa-His-tagged fusions (referred to as JAZ-His) were done as described previously (CITATION; CITATION). Primers used for cloning are described in Supplemental Table S1. JAZ-MYC2 interactions were analyzed in pull-down assays employing purified JAZ-His proteins and an epitope-tagged (9× c-Myc) derivative of MYC2, which was expressed under the control of the cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter in the jin1-9 mutant background of Arabidopsis as described above. Leaf tissue from this transgenic line (35S:Myc-MYC2) was ground to a fine powder in liquid nitrogen and extracted in 2 mL of homogenization buffer (CITATION) per gram of ground tissue with the addition of Complete Mini protease inhibitor tablet-EDTA free (Roche) and 50 µm MG132 (Sigma-Aldrich). The extract was centrifuged at 20,200g for 15 min at 4°C, and the resulting supernatant was subjected to a second centrifugation round under the same conditions. In vitro pull-down assays were done as described previously (CITATION) using 25 µg of recombinant JAZ-His and 0.5 mg of protein of 35S:Myc-MYC2 leaf extract. MYC2 binding was assessed by western-blot analysis using an anti-cMyc antibody (Covance). All in vitro pull-down assays were repeated at least three times. Arabidopsis T87 cells (CITATION) were obtained from the RIKEN BioResource Center. Cells were transformed with A. tumefaciens strain EHA105 as described by CITATION. All transgenic Arabidopsis cell lines were generated by transformation with vector pVKgw-N-YFP, which fuses YFP to the N terminus of JAZ10 isoforms (CITATION). The expression of YFP-JAZ10 proteins in T87 cells was assessed by western-blot analysis using an anti-GFP antibody (Molecular Probes). Selected T87 cell lines were inoculated into 50 mL of fresh medium and grown for 4 d to exponential phase (CITATION). For experiments involving JA treatment, a solution of MeJA (Sigma-Aldrich) was added to a final concentration of 50 µm to exponentially growing cells. Cells were harvested 2 h later on Whatman filter paper using a vacuum trap connected to a ceramic funnel. The fresh cell mass was immediately estimated and frozen in liquid nitrogen. A small aliquot of cells in the original flask was set aside for imaging by confocal microscopy (Olympus FluoView 1000 Laser Scanning Confocal Microscope). Frozen cells were ground with a mortar and pestle to a fine powder in liquid nitrogen. Protein was extracted by the addition of 2 mL of lysis buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 15 mm MgCl, 150 mm NaCl, 0.01% Tween 20, 50 µm MG132, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 14.6 µm β-mercaptoethanol, and one tablet of MiniProtean cocktail [Roche] per 10 mL of lysis buffer) per gram of liquid nitrogen-ground cell powder. The resulting mixture was thawed with gentle rocking at 4°C for 30 min and then centrifuged at 26,890g at 4°C for 30 min. The supernatant was decanted to a prechilled tube, and GFP-Trap_A resin (ChromoTek) was added (10 µL of prewashed resin per 10 g of cell powder). Prior to this step, GFP-Trap resin was washed three times with 500 µL of dilution buffer (identical to lysis buffer but lacking Tween 20). The crude cell extract/GFP-Trap resin mixture was incubated for 2 h at 4°C with gentle rocking and then centrifuged at 900g for 5 min in a swinging-bucket centrifuge (GS-6R; Beckman) at 4°C. The resulting supernatant was transferred to a prechilled tube for a second round of affinity purification using the conditions described above. Protein-bound resin from both rounds of purification was pooled and washed three times with 500 µL of ice-cold dilution buffer. Antibody-bound proteins were digested on bead by incubation for 6 h at 37°C in 10 µL of a solution containing trypsin (5 ng µL−1) and 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate. The solution was acidified by the addition of 5% formic acid and then centrifuged at 14,000g. Peptide-containing supernatant was removed and concentrated by solid-phase extraction with OMIX tips (www.varian.com). Purified peptides were then resuspended in 20 µL of a solution containing 2% acetonitrile and 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. An aliquot (10 µL) of this fraction was injected by a Waters nanoAcquity Sample Manager (www.waters.com) and loaded for 5 min onto a Waters Symmetry C18 peptide trap (5 µm, 180 µm × 20 mm) at 4 µL min−1 in 5% acetonitrile/0.1% formic acid. The bound peptides were eluted onto a Waters BEH C18 nanoAcquity column (1.7 µm, 100 µm × 100 mm) over 35 min with a gradient of 5% B to 30% B in 21 min, ramped up to 90% B at 23 min and held for 1 min, then dropped back to 5% B at 24.1 min using a Waters nanoAcquity ultra-performance liquid chromatography device (buffer A = 99.9% water/0.1% formic acid, buffer B = 99.9% acetonitrile/0.1% formic acid) with an initial flow rate of 0.8 µL min−1. Eluted peptides were sprayed into a ThermoFisher LTQ Linear Ion Trap mass spectrometer outfitted with a MICHROM Bioresources ADVANCE nano-spray source. The top five ions in each survey scan were then subjected to data-dependent zoom scans followed by low-energy collision-induced dissociation, and the resulting MS/MS spectra were converted to peptide lists with BioWorks Browser version 3.3.1 (ThermoFisher) using the default LTQ instrument parameters to filter out nonpeptide signals recorded during data acquisition. Peptide lists were searched against a custom protein sequence database consisting of Arabidopsis (The Arabidopsis Information Resource 10; www.arabidopsis.org) combined with common laboratory contaminants (downloaded from www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov) using the Mascot searching algorithm, version 2.4 (www.matrixscience.com). The Mascot output was then analyzed with Scaffold version 3.6.0 (www.proteomesoftware.com) to probabilistically validate protein identifications using the ProteinProphet computer algorithm (CITATION). Only those peptides satisfying the Scaffold 95% confidence filter were reported. The following materials are available in the online version of this article. Supplemental Figure S1.
