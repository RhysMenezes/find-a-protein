!~ABS~! When FORKED1 (FKD1) is mutated, asymmetric localization of PINFORMED1 (PIN1), particularly to the apical side of cells, fails to occur properly in developing veins, resulting in an open vein pattern. FKD1 encodes a protein with a Pleckstrin homology-like (PL) domain, suggesting interaction with phosphoinositides. FKD1 has been previously found to interact with an ADP ribosylation factor GTPase-activating protein (ARF-GAP) important for vein patterning, SCARFACE/VAN3 (SFC). We find that FKD1–green fluorescent protein (GFP) localizes to the plasma membrane and to punctae labeled by SFC–yellow fluorescent protein (YFP). Supporting the idea that the FKD1 PL domain recognizes phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate [PtdIns(4)P], FKD1–GFP co-localizes with PtdIns(4)P markers, and is more cytosolic when in a background mutant for the PtdIns(4,5)P2 hydrolases CVP2 and CVL1. Both FKD1 and SFC partially co-localize with markers for the trans-Golgi network (TGN), at which endocytic and secretory pathways merge. FKD1-labeled punctae rarely co-localize with the endocytic marker FM4-64, suggesting that FKD1 is not involved primarily in the endocytic pathway. FKD1 and SFC co-localize with members of the RABA group of RAB-GTPases, which are proposed to act in the post-Golgi secretory pathway. The compartments labeled by FKD1 and SFC do not localize to membrane compartments induced by the fungal toxin brefeldin A (BFA). Collectively, our data suggest that FKD1 and SFC act in a BFA-insensitive secretory pathway.
!~RES~! FKD1 is essential for the auxin response that directs vascular differentiation in developing cotyledons and leaves (CITATION), and is important in localizing PIN1–GFP within developing leaf vein cells (CITATION). Introduction of 35S:FKD1–GFP into fkd1 mutants results in a wild-type leaf vein phenotype (see Supplementary Fig. S1C at JXB online), suggesting that transcription driven by the 35S promoter provides adequate spatial and temporal expression, and the fusion protein is functional. In 2 DAG cotyledons, punctae of 35S:FKD1–GFP are visible in developing vascular cells (Fig. 1A), but expression is too weak to provide sufficient samples for reliable comparison. Thus, cotyledon epidermal cells were used for further analysis. We noticed that 35S:FKD1–GFP localization in cotyledon epidermal cells is different in cotyledons at different ages. At 2 DAG, when pavement cells are more or less circular in shape (see brightfield image Fig. 1G), 35S:FKD1–GFP is cytosolic in most cells (73%, n=113 cells), but is associated with the plasma membrane and/or in punctae in ~27% of cells (Fig. 1B). At 2.5 DAG, when cells are expanding and initiating lobes and indentations (Fig. 1H), more cells have 35S:FKD1–GFP associated with punctae (Fig. 1C; 20%, n=109 cells) or with punctae and the plasma membrane (Fig. 1D; 17%, n=109 cells). Lobe initiation is complete by 3 DAG (CITATION), and 35S:FKD1–GFP localization is again more cytosolic at both 3 DAG (79%, n=81 cells) and 4 DAG (Fig. 1E; 88%, n=56 cells). Because 2.5 DAG pavement cells have the highest association of 35S:FKD1–GFP with punctae and the plasma membrane, all subsequent analyses were done at this stage. [[FIGURE]] [[FIGURE]] VAN3/SFC and FKD1 form a complex which has been proposed, through their respective PH or PL domains, to bind to PtdIns(4)P, a product generated by inositol polyphosphate 5' phosphatases (5PTases) such as CVP2 and CVL1 (CITATION, CITATION). When both CVP2 and CVL1 are mutated, VAN3 is mislocalized from the TGN to the cytosol (CITATION). To investigate whether 35S:FKD1–GFP localization is similarly altered in cvp2cvl1 mutants, 35S:FKD1–GFP was introduced into the cvp2cvl1 mutant background. cvp2cvl1 mutants develop more slowly than the wild type (CITATION). To determine if cotyledon epidermal cells of 2.5 DAG cvp2cvl1 mutants expressing FKD1–GFP were at a similar stage to those in the FKD1–GFP line, we measured area (A) and perimeter (P), then calculated the UI according to the formula UI=P/[2π√(A/π)] (CITATION). We found no significant differences in these characters (Supplementary Table S1), suggesting that epidermal pavement cells in the two genotypes are at a similar stage of development at 2.5 DAG. Observation of 35S:FKD1–GFP in cotyledons of both genotypes at 2.5 DAG indicates that 35S:FKD1–GFP localization is significantly more cytosolic in cvp2cvl1 mutants (89%, n=507 cells) than in fkd1 mutants (63%, n=232 cells) (Fig. 1K–O). The phospholipid signaling pathway of Arabidopsis includes three families of phosphoinositide kinases, of which PI4Ks can yield PI4(P). In Arabidopsis, two PI4KIIIβ (PI4KIIIβ1 and PI4KIIIβ2) genes have been identified (CITATION). We asked whether FKD1 localization and expression is altered in plants mutant for both genes (CITATION). 35S:FKD1–GFP was introduced into PI4Kβ1β2 mutants, and 2.5 DAG cotyledons were analyzed for 35S:FKD1–GFP localization. No difference was observed in 35S:FKD1–GFP localization in PI4Kβ1β2 mutants compared with the original 35S:FKD1–GFP line (Fig. 1O). To assess which phosphoinositides FKD1 associates with in vivo, we created lines expressing 35S:FKD1–GFP and markers for different phosphoinositides (PIPlines; CITATION): PtdIns(3)P [UBQ10:CITRINE–2×FYVE(HRS)], PtdIns(4)P [UBQ10:CITRINE–2×PH(FAPP1)], or PtdIns(4,5)P2 [UBQ10:CITRINE–2×PH(PLCD1)]. The PIPlines are not all expressed in cotyledon pavement epidermal cells, thus we focused on co-localization within the root protoderm (Fig. 1P–R). In root protoderm cells, as in cotyledon pavement cells, FKD1–GFP is localized to the plasma membrane and to punctae in some cells, and to the cytosol in other cells. While localization to the punctae was visible when FKD1–GFP was excited with the 473 nm laser (Fig. 5; Supplementary Fig. S2A), only plasma membrane localization was visible when FKD1–GFP was excited with the 458 nm laser with a reduced emission spectrum (470–496 nm), as when co-localization with YFP/CITRINE was carried out (Fig. 1P–R). FKD1–GFP did not co-localize with the PtdIns(3)P marker UBQ10:CITRINE–2×FYVE(HRS) (PCC=0.07 ± 0.08, n=29 cell files; Fig. 1P), but co-localized very strongly with the PtdIns(4)P marker UBQ10:CITRINE–2×PH(FAPP1) (PCC=0.91 ± 0.04, n=22 cell files; Fig. 1Q) and co-localized moderately with the PtdIns(4,5)P2 marker UBQ10:CITRINE–2×PH(PLCD1) (PCC=0.69 ± 0.16, n=25 cell files; Fig. 1R). The co-localization of FKD1–GFP with PtdIns(4)P and PtdIns(4,5)P2, both of which localize to the plasma membrane (CITATION), indicates that in root protodermal cells, FKD1 is strongly associated with the plasma membrane. To establish that FKD1 is localized at the plasma membrane and to understand the nature of the punctae, we determined the co-localization of FKD1 with a set of markers specific for the plant endomembrane system in both stable (Arabidopsis cotyledon epidermal cells) and transient expression (N. tabaccum or N. benthamiana leaf epidermal cells) systems. In cotyledon epidermal cells, 35S:FKD1–GFP associated moderately with both plasma membrane markers: UBQ10:YFP–NPSN12 (average PCC 0.33 ± 0.14, n=43 cells; Fig. 2A–D; Table 1) and UBQ10:YFP–PIP1;4 (average PCC 0.22 ± 0.15, n=32 cells; Supplementary Fig. S3A–D; Table 1). Following plasmolysis of Arabidopsis seedlings expressing 35S:FKD1–GFP and UBQ10:YFP–NPSN12 or UBQ10:YFP–PIP1;4, 35S:FKD1–GFP signal remains similarly associated with the plasma membrane label (average PCC 0.39 ± 0.15, n=28 cells and 0.32 ± 0.15, n=38 cells, respectively), providing further evidence that FKD1 is associated with the plasma membrane (Fig. 2E–H; Supplementary Fig. S3E–H; Table 1). Interestingly, whereas a proportion of FKD1–GFP is, like UBQ10:YFP–NPSN12 and UBQ10:YFP–PIP1;4, uniformly distributed throughout the membrane, FKD1–GFP is also localized to bright, plasma membrane-associated foci (arrows, Fig. 2A, C, E, G). [[FIGURE]] [[FIGURE]] We next set out to better define the nature of the punctae to which 35S:FKD1–GFP localizes. In N. tabacum epidermal cells, as in Arabidopsis cotyledon epidermal cells, 35S:FKD1–GFP is frequently cytosolic but does show clear localization to punctae in a proportion of cells. We focused our analysis on those cells in which FKD1–GFP was localized to punctae. In these cells, 35S:FKD1–GFP does not co-localize with ST–RFP (average PCC= –0.30 ± 0.12, n=22 cells; Table 1; Fig. 2I–L), a marker of the Golgi apparatus (CITATION). Partial localization to the TGN/early endosome (EE) (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION) was indicated by 35S:FKD1–GFP moderately co-localizing with markers 35S:SYP61–YFP (PCC=0.37 ± 0.10, n=38 cells; Fig. 2M–P) in N. tabacum epidermal cells and UBQ10:YFP–VTI12 (PCC=0.39 ± 0.10, n=39 cells; Fig. 2Q–T) in Arabidopsis pavement cells. Taken together, our results suggest that FKD1 is localized to the plasma membrane, as well as to a subset of the TGN. Previous experiments using transient expression in a heterologous system (the leaf epidermis of N. bethamiana) showed that VAB–YFP (FKD1–YFP) and VAN3–GFP co-localized to dot-like structures (CITATION). To confirm that FKD1 and SFC co-localize in Arabidopsis and to understand further the localization of SFC, we introduced 35S:SFC–YFP into the fkd2 mutant, an allele of SFC (CITATION; CITATION). Reversion of the fkd2 leaf vein phenotype to wild type (Supplementary Fig. S1E) indicated that the fusion protein was functional and the 35S promoter sufficient for transcription. We next created stable transgenic lines expressing 35S:FKD1–GFP and 35S:SFC–YFP, and analyzed their localization patterns. 35S:FKD1–GFP co-localizes strongly with 35S:SFC–YFP in cotyledon epidermal cells (PCC=0.90 ± 0.08, n=56 cells; Fig. 3A–D; Table 1) and in root cells (PCC=0.73 ± 0.15, n=32 cells; Supplementary Fig. S2C–F; Table 1). In cotyledon cells, FKD1–GFP-labeled punctae are almost always also labeled by SFC–YFP, whereas a subset of SFC–YFP-labeled punctae are consistently not labeled by FKD1–GFP (arrow in Fig. 3C). Interestingly, we noticed that 35S:FKD1–GFP localizes more consistently to punctae in the presence of SFC than in its absence. Whereas only 37% of 2.5 DAG cotyledon cells (n=109) expressing 35S:FKD1–GFP alone had FKD1–GFP localized to punctae, all of 2.5 DAG cotyledon cells (n=56) co-expressing 35S:FKD1–GFP and 35S:SFC–YFP have FKD1–GFP localized to punctae. Like 35S:FKD1–GFP, 35S:SFC–YFP shows moderate co-localization with SYP61Pro:SYP61–CFP (average PCC=0.22 ± 0.12, n=23 cells; Fig. 4A–D) and does not associate with ST–RFP (average PCC= –0.26 ± 0.14, n=18 cells; Fig. 4E–H). [[FIGURE]] [[FIGURE]] [[FIGURE]] [[FIGURE]] While the ARF substrate of SFC is unknown, likely candidates are the ARFA1 proteins, which have been proposed as the potential substrates of SFC based on sequence similarity to their mammalian counterparts (CITATION). Six highly similar ARFA1 proteins exist in Arabidopsis (ARFA1a–ARFA1f) (CITATION). Cellular localization of only ARFA1c has been established, and it has been found to localize to the Golgi apparatus and TGN (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION, CITATION). We performed transient expression in N. tabaccum of 35S:FKD1–GFP with four members of the ARF gene family (ARFA1a, ARFA1c, ARFA1d, and ARFA1e) fused to YFP. Consistent with their localization to the TGN, 35S:FKD1–GFP shows strong co-localization with UBQ10:YFP–ARFA1c (average PCC=0.63 ± 0.13, n=23 cells; Fig. 3E–H). Supporting functional redundancy among the ARFA1 family, FKD1–GFP co-localized to a similar extent with all of UBQ10:YFP–ARFA1a, UBQ10:YFP–ARFA1d, and UBQ10:YFP-ARFA1e (average PCC=0.66 ± 0.25, n=34 cells; 0.76 ± 0.15, n=30 cells; and 0.43 ± 0.29, n=36 cells respectively; Supplementary Fig. S4). The endocytic and secretory pathways merge within the TGN (CITATION); thus, we sought to understand with which pathway FKD1 is associated. First, we determined that FKD1–GFP co-localized strongly with UBQ10:YFP–RabA1e (average PCC=0.54 ± 0.16, n=35 cells; Fig. 3I–L; Table 1), which is considered a marker of the early and recycling endosomes (CITATION). In contrast, we found that FKD1 co-localizes weakly with UBQ10:YFP–RabF2b/ARA7 (PCC=0.13 ± 0.14, n=42 cells; Fig. 3M–P; Table 1), a marker of the late endosome/pre-vacuolar complex (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION). To confirm the localization of FKD1–GFP within the EE, we treated 35S:FKD1–GFP-expressing seedlings with the fluorescent endocytic tracer FM4-64. FM4-64 labels the plasma membrane, and is taken into the cell interior by endocytosis, after which it gradually labels the entire endocytic pathway (CITATION; CITATION). Seedlings were treated with FM4-64 for 15 min, rinsed, and vesicles co-localizing with FM4-64 were observed after 15, 30, and 45 min. FM4-64 co-localized with 35S:FKD1–GFP at the plasma membrane, as indicated by a PCC of ~0.27 at all time points (Fig. 5A–L; Table 2). Surprisingly, when only punctae were considered, FM4-64 co-localized with very few 35S:FKD1–GFP-expressing punctae at all time points (15 min, 2%, n=963 punctae; 30 min, 5%, n=909 punctae; 45 min, 6%, n=966 punctae; arrows in Fig. 5A–L; Table 2). The small proportion of 35S:FKD1–GFP punctae localizing with FM4-64 suggests that FKD1 is not acting predominantly in the endocytic pathway. While our data indicate very strong co-localization of FKD1 with SFC, SFC/VAN3 has been suggested to have a role in clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CITATION). To explore this paradox, we assessed co-localization of FM4-64 with 35S:SFC–YFP. Association of SFC–YFP-expressing punctae with FM4-64 label was slightly higher than that of FKD1–GFP at the 15 min time point (7%, n=1837 punctae; Table 2; Fig. 5M–P), and increased to 21% (n=1711 punctae) at 30 min (Table 2; Fig. 5Q–T) and 23% (n=1761 punctae) at 45 min (Table 2; Fig. 5U–X). While the co-localization of SFC–YFP with FM4–64 supports the idea that a proportion of SFC/VAN3 may be acting in endocytosis, the low level of FKD1–GFP and SFC–YFP association with FM4-64 suggests that the proteins do not act primarily in the endocytic pathway. [[FIGURE]] [[FIGURE]] We asked if FKD1 and SFC might be acting in the secretory pathway by assessing their co-localization with several RAB-GTPases of the RABA group (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION). In tobacco epidermal cells, 35S:FKD1–GFP co-localized strongly with 35S:eYFP–RABA4b (average PCC=0.65 ± 0.25, n=22 cells; Fig. 3Q–T; Table 1) which is involved in secretion in both root hairs and pollen tubes (CITATION; CITATION). We attempted to assess co-localization of both SFC–YFP and FKD1–GFP with RFP–RABA1b in N. tabacum; however, in our hands, RFP–RABA1b was almost entirely cytosolic in this system. We next expressed the fusion proteins in N. benthamiana, as had been previously reported, and saw frequent localization of RFP–RABA1b to the punctae. In this system, FKD1–GFP was entirely cytosolic, but SFC–YFP was localized to discrete punctae that frequently co-localized with RFP–RABA1b (average PCC=0.84 ± 0.05, n=46 cells; Fig. 4I–L; Table 1). We also assessed co-localization of SFC–YFP with GFP–RABA1c in cotyledon pavement cells of stably transformed Arabidopsis, and found a very similar, strong co-localization (PCC=0.82 ± 0.12, n=44 cells; Fig. 4M–P; Table 1). The strong association of FKD1–GFP and SFC–YFP with RAB-GTPases acting in the secretory pathway, combined with their weak association with the endocytic marker FM4-64, suggests that a significant proportion of the proteins act in the secretory pathway. As described above, FKD1 associates with SFC/VAN3, an ARF-GAP, and also with members of the ARF1 family, raising the possibility that FKD1 might associate with an ARF-GEF. Since ARF-GEFs can be categorized based on their sensitivity to the fungal toxin BFA, we sought to eliminate possible ARF-GEF associations by assessing the BFA sensitivity of FKD1 and SFC. Comparison of 35S:FKD1–GFP localization in BFA-untreated and BFA-treated roots revealed no differences, indicating that FKD1 compartments are insensitive to BFA treatment in root tissues (compare Supplementary Fig. S2A and S2B). To compare the behavior of FKD1 compartments with BFA-induced compartments, we exposed seedlings expressing both 35S:FKD1–GFP and UBQ10:YFP–RabF2b/ARA7 to BFA. Following exposure, the UBQ10:YFP–RabF2b/ARA7 marker localized to BFA compartments in root epidermal cells, whereas 35S:FKD1–GFP remained localized to the plasma membrane and not BFA compartments (compare Fig. 6A–C with 6D–F). We next asked whether SFC was similarly insensitive to BFA by treating seedlings expressing both 35S:SFC–YFP and SYP61Pro:SYP61–CFP or 35S:GFP-RABA1c with BFA. Again, whereas SYP61Pro:SYP61–CFP and 35S:GFP–RABA1c localized to BFA compartments, 35S:SFC–YFP remained localized to small, discrete punctae in root cells (compare Fig. 6G–I with 6J–L and Fig. 6M–O with P–R). Interestingly, SYP61–CFP almost entirely localized to BFA compartments, while a proportion of GFP–RABA1c did not become incorporated into the BFA compartments. We observed a similar proportion of vesicles labeled by both SFC–YFP and GFP–RABA1c in BFA-untreated and BFA-treated root cells (arrows in Fig. 6M–R), implying that the BFA-insensitive compartment is not homogenous. To determine further whether the FKD1–SFC complex is sensitive to BFA, seedlings expressing 35S:FKD1–GFP and 35S:SFC–YFP were treated with BFA and compared with untreated seedlings. No difference was observed either in the morphology of FKD1 and SFC vesicles or in their co-localization patterns (Supplementary Fig. S2; Table 1). The insensitivity of FKD1 and SFC compartments to BFA suggests that, if they are associated with an ARF-GEF, it is likely to be a BFA-resistant member. [[FIGURE]] [[FIGURE]]
!~MM~! As described previously, (CITATION), Arabidopsis thaliana was sown on soil or plates with AT growth medium (CITATION), left at 4 °C for 3 d, and transferred to a growth chamber. The date of transfer was considered 0 days after germination (DAG). Nicotiana tabacum and Nicotiana benthamiana were grown on soil. The PIPlines (CITATION) UBQ10:CITRINE–2×FYVE(HRS), UBQ10:CITRINE–2×PH(FAPP1), and UBQ10:CITRINE–2×PH(PLCD1), and the Wave lines (CITATION) Wave 13Y [UBQ10:YFP (yellow fluorescent protein)–VTI12], Wave34Y (UBQ10:YFP–RabA1e), Wave2Y (UBQ10:YFP–RabF2b/ARA7), Wave131Y (UBQ10:YFP–NPSN12), and Wave138Y (UBQ10:YFP–PIP1;4) were obtained from the Arabidopsis Biological Resource Centre (ABRC) at Ohio State University, USA. Syp61pro:syp61–CFP (cyan fluorescent protein) seeds (CITATION) were donated by Dr Marisa Otegui, University of Wisconsin, USA. 35S:GFP–RABA1c seeds (CITATION) were donated by Dr Hugo Zheng, McGill University, Canada. pi4kβ1β2 seeds (CITATION) were obtained from Dr Erik Nielsen, University of Michigan, USA. The Columbia (Col-0) ecotype was used as a wild-type control in all experiments. Vectors containing full-length cDNA for FKD1 (U16276), members of the ARF gene family (U09053, ARF1A1a-At1g23490; U21558, ARF1A1c-At2g47170; U09461, ARFA1d-At1g70490; and U12397, ARFA1e-At3g62290) and the pnigel 7 (UBQ10:YFP) vector (CITATION) were obtained from the ABRC. pVKH18–GFPC (CITATION) and 35S:GFP–RABA1c (CITATION) were obtained from Hugo Zheng (McGill University, QC, Canada), 35S:RFP–RABA1b (CITATION) from Dr. Takashi Ueda, University of Tokyo, Japan, and 35S:YFP–RABA4b (CITATION) from Dr Erik Nielsen, University of Michigan, USA. 35S:SYP61–YFP (CITATION) and 35S:ST–RFP (red fluorescent protein) (CITATION) were obtained from Dr Federica Brandizzi, Michigan State University, USA. To generate the 35S:FKD1–GFP construct, FKD1 cDNA was amplified from U16276 using primers BAM1FKDcDNA (GGA TCCATGGAGAGAGAACTCAGACG) and FKDcDNASalI (GGTCGACTTAAGGTGCCATCCATTTG), and ligated into binary vector pVKH18-GFPC at BamHI and SalI restriction sites. To isolate SFC cDNA, RNA was isolated from 7 DAG Col-0 seedlings using the TRIzol extraction method (Ambion), treated with DNase (Turbo; Applied Biosystems), and further purified with RNeasy MinElute Cleanup (Qiagen). cDNA was generated using Retroscript primed with oligo(dT) for first-strand synthesis according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Amersham). Primers SFC-7 (GCTGTTTGTGTCGAAGAAGAG) and SFC-9 (CCGCAAGCCTATGCATCT) were used to amplify SFC cDNA which was subsequently cloned into the pCR2.1 TOPO vector (Invitrogen), sequenced to confirm fidelity, and recombined into the pEARLEYGATE101 vector (CITATION) using LR Clonase (Invitrogen Cat. No. 11791020), according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Integration of ARF1 genes into UBQ10::YFP was done by recombining their cDNAs with the pnigel7 vector and the products sequenced as described in CITATION. Transgenes 35S:FKD1–GFP and 35S:SFC–YFP were transformed via Agrobacterium tumefaciens into Arabidopsis lines fkd1 and fkd2-1, an allele of SFC (CITATION; CITATION), using the floral spray method. Transformed plants were selected for hygromycin resistance (35S:FKD1–GFP) or Basta resistance (35S:SFC–YFP). Several independent lines were screened for vein phenotype, transgene expression and protein localization, and a representative line chosen. To analyze the co-localization of FKD1 or SFC with other proteins, stable transgenic lines were made by crossing plants homozygous for 35S:FKD1–GFP with plants homozygous for UBQ10:YFP–VTI12, UBQ10:YFP–RabA1e, UBQ10:YFP–RaF2b/ARA7, UBQ10:YFP–NPSN12, UBQ10:YFP–PIP1;4, UBQ10:CITRINE–2×FYVE(HRS), UBQ10:CITRINE–2×PH(FAPP1), UBQ10:CITRINE–2×PH(PLCD1), or 35S:SFC–YFP, or by crossing plants homozygous for 35S:SFC–YFP with plants homozygous for Syp61pro:syp61:CFP or 35S: GFP–RABA1c. The localization of 35S:FKD1–GFP with the organelle marker UBQ10:YFP–VTI12 was done in the F1 generation. Homozygous lines of 35S:FKD1–GFP with UBQ10:YFP–NPSN12, UBQ10:YFP–PIP1;4, UBQ10:YFP–RabF2b/ARA7, UBQ10:YFP–RabA1e, UBQ10:CITRINE–2×FYVE(HRS), UBQ10:CITRINE–2×PH(FAPP1), UBQ10:CITRINE–2×PH(PLCD1), or 35S:SFC –YFP, and 35S:SFC–YFP with 35S:GFP–RABA1c or SYP61Pro: SYP61–CFP were identified in the F3 or subsequent generation based on resistance to hygromycin (35S:FKD1–GFP and 35S:GFP–RABA1c), Basta [35S:SFC–YFP, UBQ10:YFP–NPSN12, UBQ10:YFP–PIP1;4, UBQ10:YFP–RabF2b/ARA7, UBQ10:YFP–RabA1e, UBQ10:CITRINE–2×FYVE(HRS), UBQ10:CITRINE–2×PH(FAPP1), UBQ10:CITRINE–2×PH(PLCD1)] or kanamycin (SYP61Pro:Syp61–CFP). For transient expression in N. tabacum or N. benthamiana, the abaxial leaf epidermis was injected with Agrobacterium strains harboring appropriate binary vectors following a previous protocol (CITATION). In order to analyze the localization of FKD1 in mutants defective in phosphoinositide production, a line homozygous for 35S:FKD1–GFP was crossed to cvp2cvl1 and pi4kβ1β2, and the F1 was backcrossed to the double mutant. Homozygous plants for 35S:FKD1–GFP with cvp2cvl1 and 35S:FKD1–GFP with pi4kβ1β2 were obtained in the F3 generation by screening for the double mutant phenotype, resistance to hygromycin (35S:FKD1–GFP), and fluorescence by confocal microscopy. Because cvp2cvl1 develops slowly, we assessed characteristics of 2.5 DAG cotyledon pavement cells in the 35S:FKD1–GFP line and in cvp2cvl1 expressing 35S:FKD1–GFP. Cell perimeter (P) and area (A) were measured using NIH image on cells viewed using differential interference contrast on a Olympus Fluoview FV1000 confocal microscope, and the undulation index (UI) was calculated using the formula UI=P/[2π√(A/π)] (CITATION). Means were compared for statistical differences by the Student’s t-test. The localization of 35S:FKD1–GFP was assessed in the epidermal pavement cells of cotyledon cells at 2.5 DAG for all genotypes. An ANOVA was carried out using the PROC MIXED procedure of SAS (SAS Institute), followed by a Fisher’s test to determine statistical differences between means. Nicotiana tabacum or N. benthamiana leaves 48 h post-injection or Arabidopsis roots or cotyledons at 2.5 DAG were mounted in water and viewed using a Olympus Fluoview FV1000 confocal microscope. For BFA treatment, 2.5 DAG seedlings were incubated in 50 μM BFA for 3 h before viewing the seedlings; control seedlings were incubated in solution without BFA, but with DMSO at the same concentration as the BFA-treated seedlings. For FM4-64 treatment, 2.5 DAG seedlings were incubated in 16 mM FM4-64 for 15 min, rinsed in water, and then viewed after a further 15, 30, and 45 min. For plasmolysis experiments, 2.5 DAG seedlings were incubated in 800 mM mannitol for 3 h followed by a 2 min water rinse. For comparison of 35S:FKD1–GFP localization at different stages of development, GFP was excited with laser 473 nm (emission filters 485–585 nm). For co-localization experiments involving GFP or YFP and RFP/FM4-64, GFP/YFP and RFP/FM4-64 were excited with a 473 nm laser (emission filters 485–545 nm) and a 559 nm laser (emission filters 570–670 nm), respectively. For co-localization experiments involving YFP and CFP, YFP and CFP were excited sequentially with 405 nm and 515 nm lasers, respectively. For co-localization experiments involving GFP with YFP, GFP was excited with a 458 nm laser (emission filters 470-496 nm) and YFP with a 515 nm laser (emission filters 530–600 nm). Imaging was carried out using the line-sequential scanning mode, and all images used in comparisons were taken at the same confocal settings. To assess the co-localization of proteins, Pearson’s coefficient of correlation (PCC) values were obtained within single cells (cotyledons and leaves) or files of cells (roots) using the PSC co-localization plugin in NIH Image J software (developed at the US National Institutes of Health and available at http://rsb.info.nih.gov/nih-image/). For all co-localization analyses, at least 15 samples were analyzed for each experiment. Images shown in the figures are representative of average co-localization patterns for the samples whenever possible. Images were processed with Adobe Photoshop Elements version 5.0 software (Adobe Systems).
