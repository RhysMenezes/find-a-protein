!~ABS~! In plant cells, how integral plasma membrane (PM) proteins are degraded in a cargo ubiquitination‐independent manner remains elusive. Here, we studied the degradative pathway of two plant PM proteins: AtLRR84A, a type I integral membrane protein belonging to the leucine‐rich repeat receptor‐like kinase protein family, and OsSCAMP1 (rice secretory carrier membrane protein 1), a tetraspan transmembrane protein located on the PM and trans‐Golgi network (TGN) or early endosome (EE). Using wortmannin and ARA7(Q69L) mutant that could enlarge the multivesicular body (MVB) or prevacuolar compartment (PVC) as tools, we demonstrated that, when expressed as green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusions in tobacco BY‐2 or Arabidopsis protoplasts, both AtLRR84A and OsSCAMP1 were degraded in the lytic vacuole via the internal vesicles of MVB/PVC in a cargo ubiquitination‐independent manner. Such MVB/PVC‐mediated vacuolar degradation of PM proteins was further supported by immunocytochemical electron microscopy (immunoEM) study showing the labeling of the fusions on the internal vesicles of the PVC/MVB. Thus, cargo ubiquitination‐independent and PVC‐mediated degradation of PM proteins in the vacuole is functionally operated in plant cells.
!~RES~! We first cloned a type I integral membrane protein AtLRR84A (Figure S1) which encodes a LRR‐RLKs of 84‐kDa and generated the AtLRR84A‐GFP fusion (Figure 1A, left panel). When transiently expressed in tobacco BY‐2 protoplast, AtLRR84A‐GFP was found on the PM and small punctate structures (Figure 1A, right panel). To find out whether AtLRR84A reaches the PM via a classical endoplasmic reticulum (ER)‐Golgi‐TGN pathway as other PM proteins, we next tested the effects of two vesicle trafficking inhibitors: ARF1 (Q71L) and concanamycin A (ConcA). ARF1 (Q71L) can disrupt the transport between the ER and the Golgi while ConcA can trap the newly synthesized PM proteins in the TGN CITATION, CITATION, CITATION, CITATION-CITATION. In protoplasts co‐expressing AtLRR84A‐GFP and the PM/TGN marker RFP‐OsSCAMP1, ARF1 (Q71L) trapped both proteins in ER, whereas ConcA treatment retained these two proteins within TGN‐derived aggregates (Figures 1B,C and S2). These results indicate that AtLRR84A likely follows a similar biosynthetic ER‐Golgi‐TGN‐PM pathway as that of OsSCAMP1 CITATION. However, we cannot exclude the possibility that AtLRR84A may reach the PM first and then undergo endocytosis from the PM to reach the TGN for recycling or degradation.  [[FIGURE]] In addition to PM localization, AtLRR84A‐GFP also reached some cytosolic organelles as punctate green dots were detected inside the cells (Figure 1A, right panel). To find out the nature of these GFP positive organelles, AtLRR84A‐GFP was transiently co‐expressed with either the TGN marker RFP‐SYP61 CITATION, CITATION, CITATION or the PVC marker RFP‐AtVSR2 CITATION, CITATION, followed by confocal imaging at different time points after transformation. Eight or 16 h after transient expression, AtLRR84A‐GFP was found to partially colocalize with both markers, respectively (Figures 1D,E and S3A,B), indicating that AtLRR84A‐GFP reached both the TGN and PVC.  Interestingly, 16 h after transient expression of AtLRR84A‐GFP, weak GFP signal was detected in the vacuole (Figure 1E) and thi signal increased substantially at 32 h after expression (Figure 1F). The GFP signal was presented in the lumen rather than in the tonoplast, indicating that AtLRR84A‐GFP is internalized and subjected to degradation inside the vacuole. However, since the C‐terminus‐fused GFP faces to the cytosolic side of the membrane, it is not known how the GFP signal is internalized into the lumen of the vacuole (Figure 2A). To find out the possible mechanisms, two vacuolar markers were used in the following study. Aleurain‐GFP is a soluble vacuolar cargo reporter that trafficks to the lumen of the LV CITATION, whereas GFP‐AtVIT1 is a tonoplast marker with multiple transmembrane domains (TMDs) CITATION, CITATION. When co‐expressed with the PVC marker RFP‐AtVSR2 in tobacco BY‐2 protoplasts, similar to AtLRR84A‐GFP, both Aleurain‐GFP and GFP‐AtVIT1 reached the vacuole via the same RFP‐AtVSR2‐positive PVC (Figure 2B,D). However, when the cells were treated with wortmannin (Wort), a drug that enlarges the PVC in planta CITATION, CITATION, CITATION, CITATION, these two markers showed different localizations on the enlarged PVC: while aleurain‐GFP concentrated in the lumen to form a ball‐like structure within the enlarged PVC, GFP‐AtVIT1 stayed on the outer membrane of the enlarged PVC (Figure 2C,E). When similar experiments were performed with AtLRR84A‐GFP, the GFP signal was found primarily in the lumen of the enlarged PVC, a result similar to that of the soluble cargo aleurain‐GFP but distinct from the membrane protein GFP‐AtVIT1 (Figure 2F). These results indicate that AtLRR84A‐GFP must have internalized into the lumen of the PVC before reaching the vacuole; however, whether further processing of AtLRR84A‐GFP initiates at this compartment or LV remains unclear. Thus, the PVC may act as an intermediate compartment mediating the degradation of AtLRR84A‐GFP in the vacuole.  [[FIGURE]] To find out whether the internalization and degradation of AtLRR84A‐GFP in the vacuole depends on its ubiquitination, we removed all the potential ubiquitination cytosolic lysine residues (Figure S1) by truncating the whole C‐terminus of AtLRR84A and generated the AtLRR84A(ΔCT)‐GFP fusion (Figure 3A, left panel). When expressed in BY‐2 protoplasts, the AtLRR84A(ΔCT)‐GFP fusion showed a similar PM pattern as the full length AtLRR84A‐GFP (Figure 3A, right panel). In addition, in cells co‐expressing AtLRR84A(ΔCT)‐GFP and the PVC marker RFP‐AtVSR2, similar to AtLRR84A‐GFP, AtLRR84A(ΔCT)‐GFP was also found to reach the PVC at earlier stages (8 and 16 h) and the LV at later stage (32 h) (Figure 3B–D). These results indicate that the C‐terminus of AtLRR84A is not important for either the biosynthetic or degradative pathways of this protein.  [[FIGURE]] We next performed a similar experiment for OsSCAMP1, a tetraspan PM protein (Figure 4A). Upon transient expression in tobacco BY‐2 protoplasts, OsSCAMP1‐GFP colocalized with the TGN marker RFP‐SYP61 (Figure S3C) but separated from the PVC marker RFP‐AtVSR2 (Figure 4B) at 8 h after transformation. However, at a later stage (16 or 32 h after transformation), OsSCAMP1‐GFP gradually reached the PVC and LV, respectively (Figure 4C,D). Therefore, OsSCAMP1‐GFP follows the same PVC‐LV degradative pathway as that of AtLRR84A‐GFP, even though OsSCAMP1‐GFP reaches the PVC and vacuole more slowly (Figures 1 and 4).  [[FIGURE]] To find out whether the vacuolar internalization and degradation of OsSCAMP1 is dependent on its ubiquitination, we first studied the fate of an OsSCAMP1 mutant missing its potential sites for ubiquitination at the N‐terminus. N119‐GFP, an OsSCAMP1 mutant lacking most of its N‐terminus, remained on the PM CITATION. When expressed in BY‐2 protoplast, N119‐GFP was found to follow the identical degradative pathway as that of the full length OsSCAMP1 because it reached the vacuole via the PVC (Figure 5B,C). To exclude the potential ubiquitination of the two lysine residues at the C‐terminus of N119‐GFP, these two lysine residues were mutated, and the N119(K289A,K294A)‐GFP fusion was generated (Figures 5A and S4). Similarly, when expressed in BY‐2 protoplast, the N119(K289A,K294A)‐GFP fusion reached the vacuole via the same PVC (Figure 5D,E). When the remaining lysine residues are analyzed, a lysine residue is predicted to locate within the third TMD but is found to be very close to the cytosolic flanking region (Figure 6A). To exclude the possibility that this lysine residue may locate in the cytosol and cause ubiquitination of the fusion protein, we also mutated it into alanine for analysis. As shown in Figure 6B,C, N119(K208A,K289A,K294A)‐GFP was found to reach the vacuole in an identical way as that of OsSCAMP1‐GFP, N119‐GFP and N119(K289A,K294A)‐GFP.  [[FIGURE]] [[FIGURE]] GFP fusions have been widely used to study the vacuolar degradation mechanisms of model marker proteins in various organisms including EGFR in mammals CITATION, CPS in yeast CITATION and FLS2 in plants CITATION. In these studies, GFP was fused to the cytosolic side of the membrane proteins, but GFP alone did not induce either vacuolar degradation or ubiquitination of these fusion proteins. To rule out the possibility that internalization of the PM proteins is induced by the GFP fluorescent tag in our experiments, we next analyzed the topology of the membrane proteins using a previously established method CITATION. As shown in Figure S5, the GFP tag was shown to be present at the cytosolic side of the membrane in AtLRR84A‐GFP, SCAMP1‐GFP and GFP‐AtVIT1 fusion proteins. As both AtLRR84A‐GFP and SCAMP1‐GFP but not GFP‐AtVIT1 were detected in the lumen of the PVC and vacuole (Figures 1, 2 and 4), we therefore conclude that the GFP tag alone does not induce vacuolar degradation of the fusion proteins in our study, which is consistent with previous studies on FLS2 and CLAVATA 1 CITATION, CITATION.  The possible effect of GFP fusion to the N‐terminus of either OsSCAMP1 or AtLRR84A was also tested. As shown in Figure S6, similar to OsSCAMP1‐GFP, GFP‐OsSCAMP1 gradually reached the PVC and vacuole at 16 and 32 h after transient expression, indicating that the position of GFP fusion to OsSCAMP1 did not change their fate. However, N‐terminal GFP fusions to AtLRR84A prevented them from leaving the ER upon transient expression in protoplasts (Figure S7), indicating that such fusion is not proper for reflecting the untagged protein. Indeed, studies on PM receptors including BRI1 CITATION, BRI1‐associated receptor kinase 1 CITATION, CLAVATA 1 CITATION, TOO MANY MOUTHS CITATION and FLS2 CITATION have been carried out using GFP fusions at their cytosolic C‐terminus.  To further confirm the results obtained from the above experiments using tobacco BY‐2 protoplasts, we next generated transgenic tobacco BY‐2 cells overexpressing AtLRR84A‐GFP or OsSCAMP1‐YFP CITATION. As shown in Figure 7A,B, both AtLRR84A‐GFP and OsSCAMP1‐YFP are localized to the PM and some punctate cytosolic organelles. However, the GFP signal in the vacuole was also observed in cells expressing AtLRR84A‐GFP (Figure 7A) but not OsSCAMP1‐YFP (Figure 7B). To characterize these GFP‐positive organelles, transgenic BY‐2 cells were subjected to high‐pressure freezing/frozen substitution, followed by ultrathin sectioning and immunogold EM studies with GFP antibodies. As shown in Figure 7C–H, both AtLRR84A‐GFP and OsSCAMP1‐YFP were found to localize to the PM (Figure 7C,F), TGN (Figure 7D,G) and internal vesicles of MVB/PVC (Figure 7E,H). When statistical analysis was carried out, the relative abundance of AtLRR84A‐GFP and OsSCAMP1‐YFP on TGN or MVB/PVC was different: while OsSCAMP1‐YFP was mainly located in the TGN, and early endosomes that may be involved in the recycling of PM proteins CITATION, CITATION, CITATION, CITATION, CITATION, CITATION, AtLRR84A‐GFP showed a much higher percentage of labeling on the internal vesicles of MVB (Table S1).  [[FIGURE]] To further find out if the above results obtained in BY‐2 cells are also valid in Arabidopsis cells, we performed identical experiments using Arabidopsis protoplasts. As shown in Figure 8, all the previously tested four GFP fusions, AtLRR84A‐GFP, AtLRR84A(ΔCT)‐GFP, OsSCAMP1‐GFP and N119(K208,K289A,K294A)‐GFP showed similar PVC to vacuole patterns, a result identical to those observed in BY‐2 protoplasts (Figures 1-6). To further study the fate of these PM proteins on the MVB/PVC, we co‐expressed RFP‐ARA7(Q69L), a GTP binding form of the small GTPase ARA7, causing the enlargement of plant PVC/MVB CITATION, CITATION. As shown in Figure 9, all four GFP fusions, AtLRR84A‐GFP, AtLRR84A(ΔCT)‐GFP, OsSCAMP1‐GFP and N119(K208,K289A,K294A)‐GFP were found in the lumen of the enlarged PVC caused by RFP‐ARA7(Q69L) co‐expression (Figure 9A–D), which is similar to that of the soluble cargo reporter aleurain‐GFP (Figure 9F), whereas GFP‐AtVIT1 remained on the limiting membrane (Figure 9E).  [[FIGURE]] [[FIGURE]] To further verify the above confocal data, we next carried out western blot analysis to follow the fate of these fusions upon transient expression in Arabidopsis protoplasts. As shown in Figure 10, in cells expressing either the full length or lysine truncated/mutated fusions of AtLRR84A and OsSCAMP1, a 25 kDa protein band, which represents the classical vacuolar degradative products of the GFP fusions CITATION, CITATION-CITATION, was detected in the CS (cell soluble) fraction by GFP antibodies. In addition, in cells expressing AtLRR84A or its CT truncation, the relative amount of their full‐length fusions were estimated to be similar, accounting for about 34–40% of the total protein detected by anti‐GFP (Figure 10A). Similarly, in cells expressing OsSCAMP1 or its truncated/mutated fusions, the relative amount of their full‐length fusions were also estimated to be similar, but accounting for about 56–59% of the total protein detected by anti‐GFP (Figure 10B).  [[FIGURE]] To further find out whether AtLRR84A and OsSCAMP1 are ubiquitinated upon their expression in plant cells, we also performed pull down analysis following a similar strategy described previously CITATION, CITATION, using the MLO‐1‐GFP fusion as the positive control for ubiquitination CITATION. Thus, total proteins isolated from protoplasts expressing various constructs were first subjected to pull down experiments with GFP‐TRAP, followed by protein separation via SDS‐PAGE and subsequent western blot detection using either GFP or ubiquitin (UBQ) antibodies. As shown in Figure 11, all expressed fusions were successfully affinity‐purified and detected by GFP antibodies (Figure 11A). However, while the positive control MLO‐1‐GFP fusion was recognized as protein smears (typical for polyubiquitinated proteins) by UBQ antibodies CITATION, no signal was detected in cells expressing the two PM proteins AtLRR84A‐GFP and OsSCAMP1‐GFP (Figure 11B). Taken together, all these results demonstrate the existence of a conserved PVC‐mediated and cargo ubiquitination‐independent vacuolar degradative pathway for PM proteins in both tobacco BY‐2 and Arabidopsis cells.

!~MM~! General methods for construction and characterization of recombinant plasmids, maintenance of suspension cultured tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) BY‐2 cells have been described previously CITATION, CITATION, CITATION.  The construction of OsSCAMP1‐GFP and N119‐GFP transient expression cassette has been described previously CITATION. For the construction of N119(K289A,K294A)‐GFP, two primers (forward primer, P1: 5′‐GGGGGATCCATGCCTCCATTTCTGCCACTCATCCATCA‐3′; reverse primer, P2: 5′‐GGGCTCGAGAAAAGCTGCCCGCATAGCACCCCTAGTTGCATCACGAGCCATCTCAGCAGCTGCTCCACTTCCTCGGAAGTACATGTACACTT‐3′) were used to amplify the N119(K289A,K294A) cDNA. To make the N119(K208A,K289A,K294A)‐GFP construct, two new primers (P3: AGGACTGATAGTGCCTTGGCATTTGGATTGTT; P4: AACAATCCAAATGCCAAGGCACTATCAGTCCT) which carry the designed mutation in the middle were used together with P1 and P2 to introduce the mutation. The PCR amplified fragments were double digested with BamHI/XhoI and cloned into N119‐GFP transient expression cassette CITATION via the same restriction sites.  For the construction of AtLRR84A‐GFP, two primers (forward primer, P5: 5′‐GGGGGATCCATGAAAACACAATCAGCTTCACCG‐3′; reverse primer, P6: 5′‐GGGACTAGTATAGTGTCCGTAATGGTACGATGG‐3′) were used to amplify AtLRR84A cDNA. For the construction of AtLRR84A(ΔCT)‐GFP, two primers (forward primer, P5; reverse primer, P7: 5′‐GGGACTAGTGCAGCAGCAGCAGCAATAAACGTAGAAGAAGATAAGAGCG‐3′) were used to amplify AtLRR84A(ΔCT) cDNA. The PCR amplified fragments were double digested with BamHI/SpeI, then cloned into pBI221 transient expression cassette or pBI121 binary vector via the same restriction sites.  Generating of tobacco BY‐2 cell lines overexpressing OsSCAMP1‐YFP has been described previously CITATION. For BY‐2 cell lines overexpressing AtLRR84A‐GFP, pBI121 vector with AtLRR84A‐GFP expression cassette was introduced into Agrobacterium (strain LBA4404) to transfect the wild type tobacco BY‐2 cells as described previously CITATION. Transfected BY‐2 cells were transferred onto MS medium (Sigma‐Aldrich) containing kanamycin (50 mg/mL) and cefotaxin (300 mg/mL) and incubated at room temperature for 3–4 weeks until transformed colonies were visible. Resistant cell colonies (50–100) were subjected to preliminary screening for GFP signals and patterns via fluorescent microscopy. Selected transgenic cell lines were then transferred into MS liquid medium containing kanamycin (50 mg/mL) to initiate the suspension culture and used for further analysis. Transgenic BY‐2 cell lines were maintained in both liquid and solid culture via subculturing (twice per week for suspension cultures and twice per month for calli on agar plates).  For drug treatment experiments, aliquots of Wort [(Sigma‐Aldrich; stock at 1.65 mm in dimethyl sulphoxide (DMSO)] or ConcA (Sigma‐Aldrich; C‐9705; stock at 1mm in DMSO) solution were added to tobacco BY‐2 protoplasts to give the final concentration of 16.5 μm (Wort) or 2 μm (ConcA).  Transient expression with tobacco BY‐2 and Arabidopsis PSBD protoplasts was carried out essentially as previously described CITATION. Confocal fluorescence images were collected at about 16 h or specific time points after transformation using an Olympus FV1000 system (http://www.olympusconfocal.com). Images were processed using Adobe Photoshop software (http://www.adobe.com) as previously described CITATION.  GFP antibodies were purchased from Molecular Probes (catalog No. A‐11122) or generated using recombinant GFP purchased from Roche Applied Science http://www.roche‐applied‐science.com; (catalog no. 1,814,524) as antigens to inject rabbits at the CUHK and then affinity‐purified using a CnBr‐activated Sepharose (Sigma‐Aldrich) column conjugated with recombinant GFP. For western blot analysis, GFP antibodies were used at 4 µg/mL. UBQ antibodies were purchased from ABcam (catalog No. ab7780) and used at a dilution of 1:500.  Arabidopsis protoplasts were lysed by passing through a 255/8‐gauge needle for 20 times in the lysis buffer: 10 mm Tris/Cl pH7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm EDTA with protease inhibitors. Pellet was collected (20,000× g, 2 min, 4°C) and resuspended in the lysis buffer with 1% (v/v) Triton X‐100. Supernatant was incubated with GFP‐TRAP agarose beads (ChromoTek, Germany) for 6 h at 4 °C. Samples were washed twice (2600× g, 2 min, 4°C) in the wash buffer: 10 mm Tris/Cl pH7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm EDTA with protease inhibitors and resuspended in the lysis buffer.  The general procedures for transmission electron microscopy sample preparation and thin sectioning of samples of BY‐2 cells were carried out as described previously CITATION, CITATION. For high‐pressure freezing, BY‐2 cells collected on a filter paper were immediately frozen in a high‐pressure freezing apparatus (EM Part2, Leica, http://www.leica‐microsystems.com). For immunolabeling, standard procedures were performed as described previously CITATION, with Anti‐GFP at 100 µg/mL and gold‐coupled secondary antibodies at 1:50, following the poststaining procedures by aqueous uranyl acetate/lead citrate. Sections were examined using a Hitachi H‐7650 transmission electron microscope with a CCD camera operating at 80 kV (Hitachi High‐Technologies Corporation, http://www.hitachi‐hitec.com/).  All procedures were performed essentially as previously described with minor modifications CITATION. ARF1 (T31N) was co‐expressed with YFP/GFP‐tagged fusion proteins in tobacco BY‐2 protoplasts to trap the fusions within the ER. 13 hours after transformation, protoplasts (approximately 107) were diluted with 250 mm NaCl for at least threefolds, followed by centrifugation at 100× g for 10 min. Packed protoplasts were lysed by passing through a 255/8‐gauge needle for 20 times. Cell lysate was centrifuged at 500× g for 5 min to remove the unbroken cells and cell debris. The supernatant was divided into two parts with equal volume (for either trypsin+ or trypsin‐ treatment) and centrifuged at 100,000× g for 15 min to pellet the microsomes. Microsomes were washed once with 250 mm NaCl and resuspended with 50 μL 25 mm NH4HCO3 with or without 40 µg/mL trypsin. After 1 h incubation at 37°C, 5 μL of the homogenate was used for direct confocal imaging. Ten representative images of different areas were taken and merged into a single image using ImagJ software.
