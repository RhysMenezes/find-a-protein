!~ABS~! Following prenylation, the proteins are subject to two prenyl-dependent modifications at their C-terminal end, which are required for their subcellular targeting. First, the three C-terminal residues of the CAAX box prenylation signaling motif are removed, which is followed by methylation of the free carboxyl group of the prenyl cysteine moiety. AnArabidopsis homologue of the yeast CAAXprotease STE24 (AFC1) was cloned and expressed in rce1Δ ste24Δ mutant yeast to demonstrate functional complementation. The petunia calmodulin CaM53 is a prenylated protein terminating in a CTIL CAAX box. Coupled methylation proteolysis assays demonstrated the processing of CaM53 by AtSTE24. In addition, AtSTE24 promoted plasma membrane association of the GFP-RacU88402fusion protein, which terminates with a CLLM CAAX box. Interestingly, a plant homologue of the second and major CAAX protease in yeast and animal cells, RCE1, was not identified despite the availability of vast amounts of sequence data. Taken together, these data suggest that AtSTE24 may process several prenylated proteins in plant cells, unlike its yeast homologue, which processes only a-mating factor, and its mammalian homologue, for which prenyl-CAAX substrates have not been established. Transient expression of GFPAtSTE24 in leaf epidermal cells ofNicotiana benthamiana showed that AtSTE24 is exclusively localized in the endoplasmic reticulum, suggesting that prenylated proteins in plants are first targeted to the endoplasmic reticulum following their prenylation. 
!~RES~! Yeast and human STE24 amino acid sequences were used to search theArabidopsis data base. A genomic sequence of 3097 bp from chromosome 4 (GenBankTM accession number AF007269) with a deduced 939-bp cDNA showing high homology to both yeast and human STE24 was identified. We termed this gene AtSTE24. AtSTE24 cDNA was cloned from a flower cDNA library using a PCR-based approach with oligonucleotide primers, designed according to the genomic sequence. The PCR amplification yielded a 1275-bp fragment, which was 336 bp longer than the sequence predicted by the Arabidopsis Genome Initiative. Using the same primers in an RT-PCR reaction, a 1257-bp fragment was also amplified from a Col-0 poly(A)+ RNA (see Fig. 3). Sequence analysis showed that the discrepancy between our results and the ArabidopsisGenome Initiative predictions were caused by two exons that had previously been misinterpreted as introns (Fig.2 A) and also by a short sequence of 30 bp, which had been misinterpreted as an exon (Fig.2 A).  [[FIGURE]] [[FIGURE]]  AtSTE24 cDNA (GenBankTM accession numberAF353722) encodes a protein consisting of 424 amino acid residues with a calculated molecular mass of 48.455 kDa. The amino acid sequence showed 51 and 49% identity with yeast and human STE24 proteins, respectively (Fig. 2 A). Hydropathy plot analysis showed that AtSTE24 is predicted to have seven membrane-spanning domains (Fig.2 B). AtSTE24 possesses two conserved sequence motifs: 1) HEXXH, which is a signature of zinc metalloproteases and 2) a C-terminal KKXX, the ER membrane retention signal (Fig.2). The apparent sequence similarity between AtSTE24 and its yeast and mammalian homologues suggests that it could function as a CAAX protease. This prediction, although likely to be confirmed, required further functional analysis.  Real time RT-PCR was used to determine the expression pattern of AtSTE24 and prove that it is an Arabidopsis gene. Total RNA was isolated from the leaf stem and flower tissues and used to make cDNA by means of reverse transcriptase. Real time PCR with gene-specific primers was used to determine the relative levels of RNA in each tissue (Fig. 3 A). AtSTE24 expression levels were normalized against the level of ubiquitin, which was amplified from the same RNAs. The results showed that AtSTE24 is expressed ubiquitously throughout the plant (Fig.3 A), with expression levels slightly higher in flowers. The melting curves of the real time PCR reaction (Fig. 3 B) showed that a single product was amplified in all of the reactions. This conclusion is further supported by the gel electrophoresis of the total reaction products (Fig. 3 C), where only a single band was detected in each of the reactions. The real time PCR reaction product migrated as ∼1.3-kb products, close to the calculated size of AtSTE24.  AtSTE24 was transiently expressed as a fusion protein with either GFP or CFP (cyan fluorescent protein) to determine its subcellular localization in plants (Fig. 4). GFP-AtSTE24 was exclusively localized in polygonal net-like structures when expressed in the epidermal cells of N. benthamiana (Fig. 4 A). This subcellular localization of GFP-AtSTE24 is very similar to that of the plant ER marker protein ACA2p-GFP (CITATION) (Fig. 4 B). To prove that AtSTE24 and ACA2p localize to the same subcellular fraction, CFP-AtSTE24 and GFP-ACA2p were coexpressed in the same cells. The colocalization data (Fig. 4, C–E) show that the two fusion proteins localized to the same fraction. The localization of both fusion proteins differs markedly from the localization of nonfused GFP, which can be detected dispersed throughout the cytosol and nucleus (Fig. 4 F). This distribution of free GFP is typical of plant cells. Because of its size, GFP diffuses through the nuclear pores and enters the nucleus unspecifically. In addition, plant cells have large vacuoles that encompass most of the cell volume. Because of the vacuoles, in fluorescence and confocal microscope imaging, the cytoplasm often appears as a diffuse line with invaginations circumventing cells and as strands crossing the cell. These combined data suggest that, like its yeast homologue, AtSTE24 is localized in the ER (CITATION).  [[FIGURE]] To determine whether AtSTE24 is a functional homologue of the yeast STE24 protease, it was expressed in mutant ste24Δ rce1Δ S. cerevisiae cells. Complementation was tested by evaluating the relative levels of biologically activea-factor produced by MATa strains in pheromone diffusion halo assays (“Experimental Procedures”).a-Factor produces a growth inhibition zone known as a halo when applied to a mat of sst2 MATa cells, because of the growth arrest of the latter at the G1 phase of the cell cycle. The size of the halo corresponds to the concentration ofa-factor and hence to the amount of active pheromone produced by the MATa cells (CITATION). For it to be exported and functional, the 36-amino acid a-factor precursor undergoes farnesylation proteolytic trimming of the AAX (VIA) moiety by either STE24 or RCE1 carboxymethylation and two N-terminal proteolytic cleavage events, the first of which is catalyzed by STE24 (Fig. 1). Thus, the amount of active a-factor and the corresponding halo size depend directly on the STE24 activity.  The halos formed around the ste24Δ rce1Δ mutants that expressed AtSTE24 from a 2μ high copy number plasmid (Fig.5 B) were somewhat smaller than those formed around the wild type cells (Fig. 5 A). The halos were even smaller when AtSTE24 was expressed from a low copyCEN plasmid (Fig. 5 C). No halos were formed around untransformed ste24Δ rce1Δ cells (Fig.5 D), around cells transformed with vectors alone (Fig. 5,E and F), and following plasmid loss (Fig.5 G). These results show that AtSTE24 is a functional homologue of the yeast STE24.  [[FIGURE]] AtSTE24 contains a conserved HEXXH Zn2+metalloprotease signature. To determine whether this motif is required for enzymatic activity, we mutated His284 to alanine to obtain a mutated protein with an AEXXH motif. The mutant Atste24mA284 was expressed in rce1Δ ste24Δyeast cells to examine complementation by pheromone diffusion halo assay (Fig. 6). Mutant cells that expressed Atste24mA284 failed to induce halos (Fig.6 C). Control experiments showed that halos were formed around either wt or mutant rce1Δ ste24Δ cells that expressed AtSTE24 (Fig. 6, A and B, respectively) and that no halos were formed around untransformed rce1Δ ste24Δ mutant cells (Fig. 6 D).  [[FIGURE]] Yeast and human STE24 proteases do not process Ras proteins in vivo (CITATION, CITATION). However, mutated a-factor harboring the Ras2 CIIS CAAX box can be processed by yeast STE24 (CITATION). These data suggest that a conserved mechanism prevents Ras proteins from being processed by STE24. Moreover, attempts to identify RCE1 homologues in plants have so far been unsuccessful,2 implying that AtSTE24 may be the only prenyl-CAAX protease in plants. It was therefore crucial to determine whether AtSTE24 could process Ras proteins. To do so, we tested the ability of AtSTE24 to support yeast Ras function in vivo. Activated alleles of Ras induce a heat shock sensitivity phenotype in yeast that is dependent upon post-translational processing of the Ras C terminus. AtSTE24 failed to confer heat shock sensitivity when expressed in ste24Δ rce1Δ cells that express an activated allele of Ras2 (Val19), indicating that AtSTE24 cannot substitute functionally for Rce1p, the yeast Ras CAAX protease (data not shown).  Can AtSTE24 process different prenylated proteins, or is it similar to its yeast and mammalian homologues that only process a-factor? To answer this question, we examined whether AtSTE24 could process two prenylated proteins (Figs. 7 and8). One protein is a prenylated Ca2+ calmodulin from petunia called CaM53 (CITATION, CITATION). The other protein is a Rac-like GTPase called RACU88402 (GenBankTM accession number U88402).  [[FIGURE]] [[FIGURE]] The processing of CaM53 by AtSTE24 was examined by coupled methylation proteolysis assays. In these assays, prenylated unprocessed CaM53 was incubated with protein extracts containing both AtSTE24 and STE14, together with [3H]AdoMet as a methyl group donor. Carboxylmethylation of prenylated CaM53 could only occur after processing by a CAAX protease. Indeed, CaM53 methylation was detected following incubation with yeast protein extracts containing either RCE1 or AtSTE24 (Fig. 7). Counts obtained with protein extracts prepared from mutant rce1 ste24 cells were 3–15% (30–150 cpm) of the counts obtained with extracts prepared from wt RCE1 STE24 cells (Fig. 7). The reactions with extracts prepared fromste14Δ strain that lacks carboxymethyltransferase (CMT) gave similar counts to reactions with extracts prepared from rce1 ste24 cells (data not shown). Taken together, these results show that AtSTE24 could process CaM53.  To further examine the substrate specificity of AtSTE24, a Rac-like GTPase termed U88402, which terminates with a CLLM CAAX box, was expressed in yeast fused to GFP (Fig. 8). In wild type STE24 RCE1 cells (SYY508), GFP-U88402 fluorescence was detected in the endomembranes and plasma membranes (Fig. 8 A). A GFP-U88402 expressed in ste24Δ rce1Δ double mutant cells (SYY 509) was localized almost exclusively in the endomembranes (Fig.8 B). Expression of AtSTE24 in the double mutant cells (SYY 510) promoted plasma membrane association of the fusion protein (Fig.8 C) similar to its distribution in STE24 RCE1wild type cells. GFP-U88402 was localized mainly in the endomembranes when expressed in SYY518, an rce1Δ strain containing the yeast STE24 (Fig. 8 D). As with wt cells, the fusion protein was detected both in endomembrane and in plasma membrane when expressed in SYY519 ste24Δ cells that contain RCE1 (Fig.8 E). A nonprenylatable GFP-u88402mS mutant, in which the prenyl acceptor cysteine had been changed into serine, was dispersed throughout the cytoplasm (Fig. 8 F).  Collectively, these results suggest that the yeast STE24 and AtSTE24 differ in their substrate specificities. Whereas STE24 can only processa-factor, AtSTE24 is able to process different prenylated proteins both in vitro and in vivo (Figs. 7 and8). 
!~MM~! All of the plasmids used in this study are listed in Table I.  [[TABLE]] The protein data base was searched for a plant homologue of STE24 using the yeast and human STE24 amino acid sequences. A genomic sequence from Arabidopsis thaliana(GenBankTM accession number AF007269), encoding for a putative protein showing 50% homology to both yeast and human STE24 proteins, was identified. A 1275-bp fragment was amplified from a flower cDNA library using oligonucleotide primers P1 (5′-TAGAGGATCCAGATGGCGATTCCTTTCATGGAAACC-3′) and P2 (5′-ACCGCTCGAGTCTAGATTAATCTGTCTTCTTGTCTTCTC-3′). The amplified fragment was subcloned into pGEM (Table I) to create pSY16. pSY16 was then used to fully sequence AtSTE24 cDNA.  To express the GFP-AtSTE24 fusion protein in plants, aBamHI-XbaI fragment containing a full-lengthAtSTE24 cDNA sequence was cloned into pGFP-MRC (Table I) in frame with the C terminus of GFP to create pSY26. Subsequently, pSY26 was digested with SphI to isolate a 3.5-kb fragment containing the cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV35S) promoter, GFP-AtSTE24, and NOS 3′-end, which was subcloned into the plant binary vector, pCAMBIA2300, to create pSY27 (Table I). To express AtSTE24 inS. cerevisiae, a BamHI-SalI fragment of AtSTE24 was subcloned into the yeast plasmids, pJR1133 and pJR1131 (Table I), to create plasmids pSY24 and pSY25, respectively.  An expressed sequence tag of the Rac-like U88402cDNA (GenBankTM accession number U88402) was identified by data base searches for CAAX motif plant proteins. Clone number D20T7, containing RacU88402, was obtained from theArabidopsis Biology Resource Center. Two oligonucleotide primers were designed to place appropriate restriction sites on the 5′- and 3′-ends: P129 (5′-CATATGGAGCTCGCAGATGCAAACGAAGTAGTG-3′) and P124 (5′-CCGCTCGAGTCTAGATTACATCAACAAGCAGCGACG-3′). An 806-bp fragment was amplified by PCR and cloned into pGEM to create pSY106. A racU88402mS mutant in which the prenyl acceptor cysteine residue had been changed to serine was created by PCR using P129 and p125 (5′-CCGCTCGAGTCTAGATTACATCAACAAGCTGCGACGCTC-3′) oligonucleotide primers. The resulting fragment was cloned into pGEM to create pSY107. To express RacU88402 and racU88402mS fused to GFP,SacI-XbaI fragments of U88402 and u88402mS cDNAs were cloned into pGFP-MRC (Table I) in frame with the C terminus of GFP to create pSY110 and pSY99, respectively. To express GFP-U88402 and GFP-u88402mS in S. cerevisiae, pSY99 and pSY110 were digested with XhoI and XbaI to isolate GFP-U88402 and GFP-u88402mS fragments, which were subsequently blunt-ended with Klenow DNA polymerase and subcloned into pJR1138 (Table II).  [[TABLE]] Although Rac88402 was obtained from the Arabidopsis Biology Resource Center as an expressed sequence tag clone, no genomic homologue could be identified in the Arabidopsis data base. All our attempts to amplify RacU88402, either directly fromArabidopsis cDNA libraries or by RT-PCR, proved fruitless. Rac88402 shows the highest homology to a Rac2 protein ofDictyostelium discoideum, and curators at theArabidopsis data base have suggested that its likely origin is contamination of the expressed sequence tag library with foreign RNA. All of the clones were fully sequenced to confirm that no PCR and cloning-generated errors had been introduced.  All of the yeast strains used in this study are listed in Table II. Yeast transformation was carried out with a standard lithium acetate transformation protocol (CITATION).  The assays were carried out essentially as described previously (CITATION) with the following modifications. Three μl of MATa cell slurry (∼107 cells) were spotted onto a solid, rich medium (YPD) plate containing 0.01% Triton X-100 that had been spread with a lawn (∼2 × 106 cells) of the MATα sst2cells (JRY3443). After 1 day of growth at 28 °C, the relative amounts of α-factor produced by each MATa strain were evident from the size of the growth inhibition zone (halo) surrounding the MATa cells. The relative halo sizes were directly proportional to the amount of α-factor exported from theMATa cells (CITATION).   Nicotiana benthamiana plants were grown in 10-cm pots. The seeds were sown on a mix of 70% soil with vermiculite (Avi Saddeh mix, Pecka Hipper Gan) and 30% sea sand and were irrigated from below. The plants were grown in an environmental growth chamber under long days (16 h light/8 h dark cycles) at 27 °C. Light intensity was 100 μE m−2s−1.  Young leaves from N. benthamianawere injected with Agrobacterium tumefaciensGV3101/mp90 strains harboring plasmids pSY27 and pSY59. Ten-ml cultures were grown overnight at 28 °C in LB liquid medium with kanamycin (50 μg/ml). The next day, cultures were harvested by centrifugation and resuspended in 4 volumes of induction medium (50.78 mm MES, 0.5% glucose, 1.734 mm NaH2PO4, 0.2 mm acetosyringone, and 5% 20X-AB mix (20X-AB mix comprised 373.9 mm NH4Cl, 24.34 mmMgSO4, 40.23 mm KCl, 1.36 mmCaCl2, 0.18 mmFeSO4-7H2O)). The cells were grown for an additional 6 h until A 600 = 0.2–0.8. The cultures were then diluted with induction medium to A600 = 0.2 and injected into the abaxial leaf side using a 1-ml syringe (without a needle). To inject, the syringe was held against the surface of a leaf while applying counter-pressure with a finger to the opposite (adaxial) surface. The leaves were observed for GFP fluorescence at 12–24 h post-injection.  Wide field fluorescence imaging was carried out on a Zeiss Axioplan-2 Imaging fluorescent microscope, with an AxioCam cooled CCD camera, a Zeiss filter set 40, and the appropriate Pinkel set filters. Confocal laser fluorescence imaging was carried out using a Zeiss R510 confocal laser scanning microscope. Excitation was carried out with an Argon laser set to 488 nm. Emission was detected with a 525 ± 15 nm band path filter. Zeiss AxioVision, Zeiss CLSM-5, and Adobe Photoshop 6.0 were used for image analysis.  Real time RT-PCR was performed in a fluorescence temperature cycler (LightCycler; Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Total RNA was isolated from various tissues using an SV total RNA isolation Kit (Promega). cDNA first strand synthesis was performed as previously described (CITATION). cDNA corresponding to 50 ng of RNA served as a template in a 20-μl reaction containing 4 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm gene specific primers, and 2 μl of LightCycler-FastStart DNA Master SYBR Green-I mix (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The samples were loaded into capillary tubes and incubated in the fluorescence thermocycler (LightCycler) for an initial denaturation at 95 °C for 10 min. The PCR reaction consisted of 45 cycles of 15 s at 95 °C, 10 s at 55 °C, and 55 s at 72 °C. The amount of PCR products was estimated by measuring SYBR Green-I fluorescence at the end of each cycle. To confirm amplification of specific transcripts, melting curve profiles were produced at the end of each run. These melting curves were produced by measuring the fluorescence of samples cooled to 65 °C for 25 s and then reheated to 95 °C at increments of 0.1 °C/s. A 1273-bp fragment of AtSTE24 was amplified with primers p1 (5′-TAGAGGATCCAGATGGCGATTCCTTTCATGGAAACC-3′) and p2, (5′-ACCGCTCGAGTCTAGATTAATCTGTCTTCTTGTCTTCTC-3′). A 520-bp fragment of ubiquitin was amplified with primers: CGATTACTCTTGAGGTGGAG and AGACCAAGTGAAGTGTGGAC. Cycle-to-cycle fluorescence emission readings were monitored and analyzed using LightCycler Software (Roche Molecular Biochemicals).  The software first normalizes each sample by detecting the background fluorescence present in the initial cycles. 5% of the full scale fluorescence threshold is then set, and the software determines the cycle number at which each sample reaches this threshold. The cycle number at which this 5% threshold is reached correlates inversely to the log of the initial template concentration. Relative levels ofAtSTE24 transcript were corrected by normalization against the ubiquitin transcript levels. The specificity of the amplification products was further verified by subjecting the amplification products to electrophoresis on a 1% agarose gel.  Yeast strain SYY 515 (ste24Δ rce1Δ expressing GFP-CaM53), SYY 500, JRY 6958, and JRY6959 (Table II) were grown in minimal medium with the appropriate supplements to A 600 = 0.7. Total protein extracts were prepared as described previously (CITATION). Methylation assays were carried out as follows: 20 μl of SYY 515 protein extract were incubated with 20 μl of total protein extracts prepared from either SYY 500, JRY 6958, or JRY6959 in the presence of a reaction buffer containing 100 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.4, 5 mm MgCl2, 50 μmZnCl2, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μCi of [3H]AdoMet (69 Ci/mmol), and 0.5 μm AdoMet. The reactions were carried out at 30 °C for 30 min. The reactions were terminated by heat denaturation in an SDS sample buffer (CITATION). Aliquots (15 μl) of each reaction were fractionated in turn on SDS-PAGE (CITATION). The proteins were electrotransferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Schleicher & Schuell). The membranes were decorated with mouse anti-GFP monoclonal antibodies (Stress-Gene) as primary antibodies, followed by blotting grade goat anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Bio-Rad). The blots were developed with Super Signal Substrate kit (Pierce) and exposed to x-ray film (Kodak XAR). To determine the methylation of GFP-CaM53, the x-ray films were placed on the nitrocellulose membranes, and the corresponding bands were excised out of the membranes and incubated in scintillation liquid for 8 h prior to counting. To ensure that all of the counts were GFP-CaM53-dependent, corresponding membrane strips that did not contain GFP-CaM53 were excised and counted. These strips gave counts of 10–30 cpm. These background counts were subtracted from all GFP-CaM53-dependent counts. The reactions were carried out in triplicate, and the results are presented as the average counts obtained relative to wt RCE STE24, which were taken as 100%.  ABamHI-XbaI fragment containing a full-length AtSTE24 cDNA sequence was subcloned into pDNR-1 in frame with the lox-p site to create pSY77 (pDNR-1-AtSTE24) (Table I). pSY77 was used as the template together with primers p14 (5′-GTGGCGGTTATTGCAGCCGAGCTTGGACATTGG-3′) and p15 (5′-CCAATGTCCAAGCTCGGCTGCAATAACCGCCAC-3′) to mutate AtSTE24 His284 to alanine using a QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) to create pSY78. Atste24mA284was sequenced to verify that no PCR generated errors were introduced. pSY78 was digested with BamHI and XbaI to isolate a Atste24mA284 fragment, which was blunt-ended with Klenow fragment DNA polymerase and subcloned into pJR1133 to create pSY62.
