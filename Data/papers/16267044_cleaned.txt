!~ABS~! In plant Ca2+ pumps belonging to the P2B subfamily of P-type ATPases, the N-terminal cytoplasmic domain is responsible for pump autoinhibition. Binding of calmodulin (CaM) to this region results in pump activation but the structural basis for CaM activation is still not clear. All residues in a putative CaM-binding domain (Arg43 to Lys68) were mutagenized and the resulting recombinant proteins were studied with respect to CaM binding and the activation state. The results demonstrate that (i) the binding site for CaM is overlapping with the autoinhibitory region and (ii) the autoinhibitory region comprises significantly fewer residues than the CaM-binding region. In a helical wheel projection of the CaM-binding domain, residues involved in autoinhibition cluster on one side of the helix, which is proposed to interact with an intramolecular receptor site in the pump. Residues influencing CaM negatively are situated on the other face of the helix, likely to face the cytosol, whereas residues controlling CaM binding positively are scattered throughout. We propose that early CaM recognition is mediated by the cytosolic face and that CaM subsequently competes with the intramolecular autoinhibitor in binding to the other face of the helix. 
!~RES~! Identification of Deregulated Ca2+ Pumps by Functional Complementation of a Yeast Mutant—In a number of autoinhibited proteins, such as CaM-activated pumps and kinases, the binding site for the activating protein overlaps with the autoinhibitory region of the molecule. To understand the mechanism of enzyme activation, a detailed characterization and comparison of residues involved in protein-protein interaction and autoinhibition is a prerequisite. Such an analysis has to our knowledge not been carried out for any autoinhibited protein activated by CaM. To investigate the relationship between autoinhibitory and CaM binding residues in a CaM-activated Ca2+ pump we focused on ACA8, an Arabidopsis plasma membrane Ca2+-ATPase with a CaM-binding site at its N terminus (CITATION).    [[FIGURE]]   [[FIGURE]] First, a series of ACA8 mutants carrying amino acid substitutions in the presumed N-terminal CaMBD (Fig. 1) were studied for their ability to functionally complement a yeast strain (K616; Ref. CITATION) devoid of PMR1 and PMC1, the two Ca2+-ATPases present in this organism. It has previously been shown that a plant P2B Ca2+-ATPase is not able to complement pmr1 and pmc1, unless the pump molecule is deregulated either by removal of the regulatory N terminus (CITATION, CITATION, CITATION, CITATION-CITATION) or by point mutations in the regulatory region (CITATION).  Mutant ACA8 pumps carrying Ala substitutions at six amino acid positions (Trp-47, Arg-48, Leu-52, Asn-55, Arg-58, and Phe-60) were able to support growth of K616 under calcium stress conditions (Fig. 2), indicating that mutations of these residues result in pumps that can functionally replace yeast Ca2+-ATPases.    [[FIGURE]] Localization of Plant Ca2+-ATPases in Transgenic Yeast Cells—Yeast Ca2+ pumps PMC1 and PMR1 are localized to internal membranes (CITATION). Thus, improved ability of ACA8 mutants to complement for pmc1 and pmr1 could have resulted from re-localization of the heterologous protein within the yeast cells. Indeed, whereas ACA8 is known to be expressed in the plasma membrane of plant cells (CITATION), Bonza et al. (CITATION) showed that Δ74-aca8 expressed in yeast is enriched in a fraction containing membrane derived from the endoplasmic reticulum.  To localize the recombinant plant proteins in transgenic yeast cells, ACA8 and two mutants, Δ74-aca8 and aca8W47A, were equipped with a GFP tag and expressed in yeast. Addition of the GFP tag to ACA8, Δ74-aca8, and aca8W47A resulted in pumps that supported growth of K616 to the same degree as non-tagged versions (results not shown). GFP fluorescence in transgenic yeast cells was visualized by confocal laser scanning microscopy (Fig. 3). For all three pumps, fluorescence was intense in the periphery of cells and around the nucleus, indicating localization at the plasma membrane and endoplasmic reticulum, respectively. The pattern of GFP fluorescence was identical for all three plant pumps indicating that targeting of recombinant plant Ca2+-ATPase was not affected by the mutations.  Measurements of Ca2+ Pump Activity —Increased ability of mutant plant Ca2+-ATPases to complement their yeast counterparts could be the result of differential expression. However, this possibility could be ruled out as all the pumps were expressed at similar levels (Fig. 4B). Alternatively, improved complementation could be related to increased specific activity of mutant pumps. To test this possibility, the ATP hydrolytic activity in yeast microsomal membranes expressing ACA8 and derived mutants were analyzed in the presence and absence of CaM.  Hardly any ATP hydrolytic activity could be measured for wild type ACA8 in Ca2+ buffer without CaM (v = 11 ± 1.1 nmol of Pi/min/mg of membrane protein; Table 1), whereas addition of CaM resulted in increased activity of the pump by ∼20-fold (v = 210 ± 11.3 nmol of Pi/min/mg of membrane protein; Table 1). N-terminal truncated ATPase (Δ74-aca8) had high basal activity that could not be stimulated further by CaM (Table 1), as has been shown for other P2B pumps illustrating that truncation of the N terminus releases autoinhibition of pump activity.    [[TABLE]] Six mutants, W47A, R48A, L52A, N55A, R58A, and F60A showed increased activity in Ca2+ buffer without CaM compared with wild type (v = 48-95 nmol of Pi/min/mg of membrane protein, Table 1). The activity of these mutants in Ca2+ buffer was between 50 and 100% of the activity in the Ca2+/CaM buffer (Fig. 4A). The deregulated mutants were all able to functionally complement yeast pmc1 and pmr1 (Fig. 2).    [[FIGURE]] In addition to these six mutants, three mutants, L54A, Y62A, and L66A, also showed an increased activity in Ca2+-buffer (v = 30-66 nmol of Pi/min/mg of membrane protein; Table 1) corresponding to 28-35% of the CaM-stimulated activity. None of these three mutants, although, were able to functionally complement the yeast Ca2+-ATP-ases. This would indicate that a certain activity threshold is required for complementation of pmc1 and pmr1 to occur.  CaM Overlay Assays to Detect CaM Binding to Mutated ACA8 N Termini—After having identified residues in the putative CaMBD of importance for pump autoinhibition, we decided to map in detail residues of importance for CaM binding. For this purpose the N-terminal region of ACA8 comprising residues 1 to 143, as well as variants carrying single amino acid substitutions at every position in the stretch comprising Arg-43 and Lys-68, were expressed in E. coli as (His)6-tagged proteins. CaM binding was next examined by CaM overlay assays to purified, immobilized fusion proteins (Fig. 5). Binding to CaM was severely reduced in the case of four mutants (W47A, R48A, A56S, and F60A). Furthermore, eight mutants (A51S, V53A, L54A, R58A, R61A, L64A, K67A, and K68A) showed reduced binding of CaM compared with wild type. In all cases CaM binding was Ca2+ dependent, as interaction with peptide was never observed in the absence of Ca2+ (results not shown).  Binding Kinetics of CaM to Wild Type and Mutants of ACA8—Overlay assays suggested that the number of residues involved in binding of CaM (12 residues) was significantly higher than the number of residues involved in autoinhibition (6 residues). To confirm this finding and to analyze the observed protein-protein interactions in more detail, binding of CaM to the recombinant N termini of ACA8 was further analyzed by surface plasmon resonance spectroscopy. This gave us the association rate (ka) and dissociation rate (kd) for CaM binding to ACA8 N termini, and then the binding affinity (Kd) could be estimated as the ratio between the kinetic constants of the dissociation and association reaction.  Although binding kinetics were slightly altered for most mutants, four mutants, W47A, R48A, A56S, and F60A, showed a severely reduced CaM binding by surface plasmon resonance spectroscopy. In fact, it was not possible to estimate kinetic and equilibrium parameters for W47A and F60A, as the signal was too low, even at the highest CaM concentration tested (Fig. 6), whereas mutants R48A and A56S both exhibited a strongly reduced affinity for CaM (Kd ≥ 150 nm) compared with wild type ACA8 (Kd = 26 nm) (Table 2). The reduced binding observed by surface plasmon spectroscopy was well in agreement with our results from the CaM overlay assays (Fig. 5).    [[TABLE]] In addition to these four mutants, we found that the binding affinity for CaM compared with wild type ACA8 was significantly decreased for the following nine mutants: L44A, A51S, V53A, L54A, R58A, R61A, L64A, K67A, and K68A (Kd ≥ 40 nm, indicating more than 50% reduced affinity). The reduced binding affinity primarily resulted from a faster dissociation of CaM from the N termini of these mutants (kd ≥ 5.3 × 10-3 s-1) than from the N terminus of wild type ACA8 (kd = 2.9 × 10-3 s-1) (Table 2). Accordingly, these residues seem to be important for the stability of the complex between CaM and the CaMBD of ACA8. One of these nine residues, Val-53, may also be important for the recognition of CaM because its mutant exhibited an increase in its association rate toward CaM (∼50% compared with wild type ACA8). The effect of this increase in association rate on CaM affinity was counteracted by an increase of the dissociation rate of CaM (Fig. 6 and Table 2).  In addition to V53A, three other mutants, R43A, Q46A, and K49A had a faster association of CaM (ka ≥ 1.5 × 105 m-1 s-1) than wild type ACA8. As a result of the increased association rate, the binding affinity of CaM to these three N termini was slightly increased (Kd ≤ 18 nm) compared with wild type ACA8. Among the 26 mutants investigated, only substitution of Arg-43, Gln-46, Trp-47, Lys-49, Val-53, and Phe-60 significantly affected the association rate of the protein toward CaM, which would suggest that these residues are directly involved in CaM recognition. Two mutants, S57A and T63A, also showed a slight increase in CaM affinity (Kd = 12 and 17 nm, respectively), but this was caused by small alterations in both the association and dissociation rate (Table 2), which did not seem to be notably different from wild type. Likewise, all the remaining mutants (Q45A, A50S, L52A, N55A, R59A, Y62A, D65A, and L66A) had reaction kinetics similar to those of wild type resulting in Kd values ranging between 20 and 38 nm.    [[FIGURE]] Mutants that demonstrated reduced CaM binding affinity by surface plasmon resonance spectroscopy likewise showed reduced interaction in CaM overlay assays, except for the mutant L44A. This mutant showed a slight decreased CaM binding affinity (Kd = 46 nm) by surface plasmon resonance but apparently similar CaM binding as wild type ACA8 by the CaM overlay assay. Similarly, in the CaM overlay assay it was not possible to see any noteworthy differences in CaM binding to mutants R43A, Q46A, K49A, and S57A, although they showed a small increase in CaM binding affinity by surface plasmon resonance spectroscopy. These differences probably reflect a reduced sensitivity of CaM overlay assay compared with surface plasmon resonance spectroscopy.  Correlation of CaM Stimulation with CaM Binding—It is worth noting that all mutants, with the exception of R58A, were stimulated by CaM in the ATPase assays (Table 1). Even the four mutants, W47A, R48A, A56S, and F60A, that exhibited extremely low affinity for CaM were stimulated by CaM (Table 1, Fig. 4A). In the soybean Ca2+-ATPase, SCA1, two CaMBDs have been identified in the N-terminal domain (CITATION). We therefore tested the possibility that ACA8 could contain an additional CaMBD downstream of Ala-143 and therefore not present in the (His)6-tagged N termini of ACA8. CaM overlay assays on yeast microsomes expressing full-length pumps were performed and the results were similar to those of the CaM overlay assays on the N termini. Thus, only an extremely weak binding of CaM could be observed for W47A, R48A, F60A, and A56S (results not shown). No binding of CaM was observed for Δ74-aca8 arguing against a second CaMBD outside this region in ACA8. CaM was found to activate the wild type pump with a half-maximal concentration of 30 nm (results not shown), which explains why 1.2 μm CaM is sufficient to cause at least partial activation even of low affinity mutants. 
!~MM~! Plasmid Constructs—Site-directed mutagenesis of ACA8 was performed by overlap extension polymerase chain reaction (CITATION) to produce mutant genes encoding the individual alanine substitutions aca8R43A throughout to aca8L54A. In the case of Ala-50, Ala-51, and Ala-56, these residues were substituted with Ser. Three nucleic acid substitutions, G156A, G216C, and A217C, were introduced as silent mutations in the coding sequence of ACA8 to generate unique sites for the restriction enzymes SpeI and XmaI, respectively. This allowed for introduction of mutations by a cassette mutagenesis strategy to generate mutant genes encoding aca8N55A and aca8S57A throughout to aca8K68A. All mutations were verified by DNA sequencing. Wild type ACA8 and mutants were inserted into the yeast expression vector, pYES2 (Invitrogen), under control of a galactose inducible promoter. For localization purposes, a green fluorescent protein (GFP) was fused to the 3′ ends of ACA8, Δ74-aca8, and aca8W47A in the pYES2 vector just in front of the stop codon of the genes. Δ74-aca8 does not encode the first 74 amino acid residues of the regulatory N terminus (CITATION).  To produce recombinant N-terminal domain that could later be purified by NTA affinity chromatography, the coding sequences for the N termini (amino acid residue 1-143) of wild type and mutants of ACA8 were inserted into the Escherichia coli expression vector pET15b (Novagen) in this way fusing a (His)6 tag to the N terminus of the peptide.  Yeast Strains, Transformation, and Growth Media—The Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain K616 (MATa pmr1::HIS3 pmc1::TRP1 cnb1::LEU2, ade2, ura3) (CITATION) was used for expression of ACA8, Δ74-aca8, and the generated mutants. Yeast cells were transformed using a lithium acetate/single-stranded DNA/polyethylene glycol (PEG) method (CITATION). Likewise, the yeast strain K601 (MATa, leu2, his3, ade2, trp1, ura3) was transformed with the empty pYES2 vector. The transformants were selected for uracil prototrophy by plating on yeast medium containing 2% (w/v) glucose (Glc), 2% (w/v) bacto-agar, 50 mm succinic acid, pH 5.5, 0.7% (w/v) yeast nitrogen base, 40 μg/ml adenine, 30 μg/ml of the amino acids His, Leu, and Trp, and 10 mm CaCl2.  Complementation of the Yeast Mutant K616—Complementation tests were performed as previously described (CITATION).  Localization of GFP Fusion Proteins in Yeast Cells—Ura+ yeast colonies from transformation of K616 with the GFP fusion proteins of ACA8, Δ74-aca8, and aca8W47A, were inoculated in 2% (w/v) galactose (Gal), 50 mm succinic acid, pH 5.5, 0.7% (w/v) yeast nitrogen base, 40 μg/ml adenine, and 10 mm CaCl2 for 3 h at 30°C. The cells were pelleted, washed, and resuspended in H2O. Three μl of a 1:1 mixture of yeast cells of A600 = 1 and 0.5% agarose were mounted on a polylysinecoated microscope slide (Teflon-printed multiwell slide). Fluorescence was measured with a confocal laser scanning microscope (Leica TCS SP2/MP; Leica Microsystems, Bernsheim, Germany) with GFP filter setting, excited at 488 nm, and emission recorded at 500-540 nm.  Isolation of Yeast Membranes—Plant pumps were expressed in yeast grown in 1% (w/v) bacto-yeast extract, 2% (w/v) bacto-peptone, 2% (w/v) Gal, 40 μg/ml adenine, and 10 mm CaCl2, for 24 h at 30 °C. Microsomes were harvested as described (CITATION) with slight modifications. The expression level of the Ca2+ pumps in microsomes (40 μg) was analyzed by Western blotting using a specific antibody against the N terminus of ACA8 (CITATION).  ATPase Assay—ATPase activity was determined as described (CITATION). Five μg of membrane proteins from K616 expressing wild type or mutant ACA8 were assayed for 30 min at 30 °C in the following four buffers: 50 mm KNO3, 5 mm NaN3, 0.25 mm sodium molybdate, 5 mm (NH4)2SO4, 40 mm bis-Tris-Hepes, pH 7.5, 0.1 mg/ml Brij 58, 1 μm A23187, 3 mm MgSO4, 3 mm ATP, 1 mm EGTA, with and without 20 μg/ml bovine brain CaM (1.2 μm; Sigma) and with and without CaCl2 to give a free Ca2+ concentration of 20 μm. Free Ca2+ concentrations were estimated by the program WEBMAXCLITE version 1.15 (CITATION). Activities without Ca2+ were subtracted from those with Ca2+ to give the Ca2+-ATPase activity. Addition of CaM in the absence of Ca2+ did not result in any change in ATP hydrolytic activity.  Fusion Protein Purification—Vectors expressing fusion proteins were expressed in E. coli strain BL21(DE3)pLysS (Novagen) by standard procedures. Fusion proteins were purified from inclusion bodies on NTA-agarose (Qiagen) and renaturated while bound to the affinity matrix by a procedure from Amersham Biosciences (product code 18-1134-37) with the following modifications. The pellet was disrupted by sonication in 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer. All buffers included 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 1 mm dithiothreitol instead of 2-mercaptoethanol. Finally, fusion proteins were eluted with 150-200 mm imidazole in 20 mm Tris-HCl, 0.5 m NaCl, pH 8.0.    [[FIGURE]] Protein Determination—Protein concentrations were determined by the method of Bradford (CITATION). If not indicated otherwise, γ-globulin was used as a protein standard.  CaM Overlay Assays—Two μg of purified N termini were subjected to CaM overlay assays as described previously (CITATION). As a protein control, 2 μg of the purified N termini were examined by Western blotting using Penta-His antibody (Qiagen).  Surface Plasmon Resonance Spectroscopy—Surface plasmon resonance spectroscopy was achieved with a BIAcoreX optical biosensor instrument (Biacore AB, Uppsala, Sweden) using a NTA sensor chip (NTA bound to a solid support). Surface plasmon resonance buffers were as follows: (i) regeneration buffer: 10 mm Hepes, 0.15 m NaCl, 0.35 m EDTA, 0.005% (v/v) Surfactant P20, pH 7.4; (ii) immobilization buffer: 10 mm Hepes, 0.15 m NaCl, 0.005% (v/v) Surfactant 20, pH 7.4; (iii) nickel buffer: 500 μm NiCl2 in immobilization buffer; (iv) eluent buffer: 1 mm EGTA, 40 mm bis-Tris-Hepes, pH 7, 50 mm KCl, 0.1 mm ammonium molybdate, 5 mm (NH4)2SO4, 0.1 mg/ml Brij 58, 3 mm MgSO4, 1 mm inosine 5′-triphosphate, and CaCl2 to give a free Ca2+ concentration of 1 μm. All reactions were done at 25 °C. The sensor chip contains two flow cells that are run in parallel of which one provides background corrections for nonspecific binding of CaM. After extensive washing with regeneration buffer followed by immobilization buffer, the NTA surface was saturated with Ni2+ by loading nickel buffer into the two flow cells (1-min pulse at 5 μl/min). The (His)6-tagged N termini were injected into one of the flow cells in immobilization buffer (20-min pulse at 5 μl/min) until a resonance response unit of 250-270 was obtained. The buffer was changed to eluent buffer and a concentration range (60-600 nm) of bovine brain CaM (Sigma) in eluent buffer was injected into both flow cells (80 s pulse at 75 μl/min). After the dissociation phase, the NTA chip was regenerated by injection of regeneration buffer (1-min pulse at 5 μl/min for 3 times). The data were analyzed using BIAevaluation 3.0 software (Biacore AB) and kinetic analyses of primary sensorgrams were carried our by global fitting using a 1:1 Langmuir binding model.
