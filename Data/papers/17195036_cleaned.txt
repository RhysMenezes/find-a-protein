!~ABS~! Phytohormone abscisic acid (ABA) regulates many aspects of plant development and growth. To explore the molecular mechanism of ABA, we identified the novel ABA-regulated genes in Arabidopsis thaliana by searching for genes possessing two or more ABREs (ABA-responsive elements). One of these genes, two or more ABREs-containing gene 2 (TMAC2) is highly induced by ABA and NaCl. Database searches revealed that TMAC2 encodes a protein with no domains of known function. Expression of TMAC2-GFP fusion protein in Arabidopsis mesophyll protoplasts indicated that TMAC2 is targeted to the nucleus. Although the gene has a basal level of expression in various Arabidopsis organs/tissues except for adult leaves, a high expression level was detected in roots. Constitutive overexpression of TMAC2 in plants resulted in the insensitivity to ABA and NaCl, suggesting that TMAC2 plays a negative role in ABA and salt stress responses. Furthermore, TMAC2-overexpressing plants exhibited the short roots, late flowering and starch-excess phenotypes. RT-PCR analysis showed that decreased expression of two floral- and one starch degradation-related genes, SOC1/AGL20 and SEP3/AGL9, and SEX1, respectively, may lead to altered phenotypes of TMAC2-overexpressing plants. Taken together, our data reveal that TMAC2 acts in the nucleus and is an important negative regulator of ABA and salt stress responses, and could play a critical role in controlling root elongation, floral initiation and starch degradation.
!~RES~! To facilitate the genetic analysis of the ABA response, we have identified novel ABA-regulated genes using an in silico method by searching for genes possessing two more ABREs within the promoter region in Arabidopsis (Huang and Wu CITATION). One of these genes, TMAC2, in the locus At3g02140, contains three ABREs within the 600-bp region upstream of the translation start site. To examine whether TMAC2 was up-regulated by ABA or abiotic stress, Northern blot assay was performed with the 2-week-old seedlings treated with ABA or abiotic stress. The transcript accumulation of TMAC2 under ABA and salt treatments was higher than that with mock treatment (Fig. 1A), while the level of TMAC2 transcript in response to PEG and cold treatments was less than that of the control. [[FIGURE]]  Comparison of cDNA and genomic DNA sequences indicated that TMAC2 is an intron-less gene (data not shown). The gene revealed an open reading frame encoding for a 319-amino acid protein with a calculated molecular mass of 35.5 kDa and PI 8.55. Southern blot hybridization revealed that TAMC2 is a single-copy gene (data not shown). A BLAST search revealed that TMAC2 has 29% identity and 46% similarity to Arabidopsis AFP protein (ABI five binding protein; locus number At1g69260) (Lopez-Molina et al. CITATION). TMAC2 also shows a high degree of similarity to three unknown proteins: At1g13740 (Arabidopsis thaliana, 30% identity and 46% similarity), At3g29575 (A. thaliana, 34% identity and 46% similarity), and XP_479067 (Oryza sativa, 31% identity and 49% similarity) (Fig. 1B). Although these proteins differ in length, all share conserved sequences at the N and C termini. Furthermore, a search with use of the program Pfam (http://www.sanger.ac.uk/Software/Pfam) revealed no domains of known function in TMAC2. To examine the tissue expression pattern of TMAC2 in Arabidopsis, Northern blot analysis was performed with total RNA extracted from various tissues. The level of TMAC2 transcript was high in seedlings and roots but lower in dry seeds, flowers and siliques (Fig. 1C) and barely detectable in rosette leaves of adult plants. To determine the spatial and temporal expression patterns of TMAC2 more precisely, the TMAC2 promoter (about 1.8-kb upstream of the translation start codon) was fused to a reporter gene encoding β-glucuronidase (GUS) to generate TMAC2::GUS, which was introduced into the wild-type plants through Agrobacterium-mediated transformation (Clough and Bent CITATION). GUS staining was readily visible in the leaves of seedlings (Fig. 2A), root tip (Fig. 2B), junction of primary and lateral roots (Fig. 2C), filaments of opened flowers (Fig. 2D) and junction of siliques and pedicels (Fig. 2E) but barely detectable in rosette leaves of adult plants (data not shown). After ABA treatment, GUS activity was greatly increased in leaves and roots (Fig. 2F, G and H). These results are consistent with those of Northern blot analysis of TMAC2 expression in various tissues (Fig. 1C). [[FIGURE]]  To determine the subcellur localization of TMAC2 protein in Arabidopsis, we amplified TMAC2 full-length cDNA by RT-PCR and fused it with GFP protein, TMAC2-GFP, which was introduced into Arabidopsis mesophyll protoplasts by PEG-mediated transfection (Hwang and Sheen CITATION). Bright green fluorescence was detected in the nucleus of protoplasts after 8 h of incubation, which implies that TMAC2 localizes to the nucleus (Fig. 3). [[FIGURE]]  To functionally analyze the role of TMAC2 in planta, we used overexpression and RNAi-mediated suppression approaches to generate 35S::TMAC2 and TMAC2-RNAi transgenic plants (Fig. 4A). RT-PCR analysis showed that the TMAC2 transcripts at the highest level in the independent TMAC2-overexpressing lines harvested at 2 weeks (Fig. 4B). Furthermore, comparison of wild-type with RNAi-transgenic plants, the marked reduction of TMAC2 transcript was observed in the RNAi-transgenic lines with or without ABA treatment. We used the T4 generation of these transgenic plants for further analyses. [[FIGURE]]  Previous reports have demonstrated that high concentrations of ABA or NaCl inhibit the germination and growth of wild-type seeds (Leung and Giraudat CITATION; Finkelstein et al. CITATION). To investigate whether TMAC2 plays a role in the seed germination response to ABA and NaCl, seeds of 35S::TMAC2, TMAC2-RNAi and wild-type plants were incubated on medium supplemented with ABA or NaCl. Compared to wild-type seeds, the 35S::TMAC2 transgenic seeds were more insensitive to inhibition of germination by ABA (Fig. 5A), especially at 0.5 μM ABA (P < 0.01). At 1 μM ABA or above, seed germination of the wild-type, 35S::TMAC2 and TMAC2-RNAi seeds was greatly inhibited, with less clear differences in germination. The 35S::TMAC2 transgenic seeds were also more resistant to NaCl treatment than wild-type and TMAC2-RNAi transgenic seeds (Fig. 5B). Thus, TMAC2 modulates the responses of ABA and NaCl in germination. We next investigated the effects of TMAC2 on ABA-induced stomatal closing and senescence as well as salt tolerance to confirm the roles of TMAC2 in ABA and NaCl signaling. The stomatal closure in 35S::TMAC2 transgenic plants was less sensitive to ABA than TMAC2-RNAi and wild-type plants at 1 and 10 μM ABA (P < 0.001) (Fig. 5C). Additionally, Fig. 5D shows that the ABA-induced senescence of detached leaves was impaired in 35S::TMAC2 transgenic plants. For salt tolerance assay, 35S::TMAC2, TMAC2-RNAi transgenic and wild-type seeds were plated on the half-strength MS medium containing NaCl, in the range from 100 mM to 200 mM, and grown for 21 days. As shown in Fig. 5E, constitutive overexpression of TMAC2 severely reduced the salt tolerance, approximately 85% wild-type and TMAC2-RNAi transgenic plants survived in the medium plus 200 mM NaCl, whereas only 30% of 35S::TMAC2 transgenic plants survived. All the 35S:TMAC2, TMAC2-RNAi transgenic and wild-type plants had a 100% survival rate when they were not treated with NaCl (data not shown). [[FIGURE]]  We next examined the effect of TMAC2 on ABA-induced gene expression. Surprisingly, RT-PCR analyses showed TMAC2-overexpressing plants with a markedly decreased level of expression of two ABA-induced genes, RD29A and COR47, as compared to wild-type plants under ABA treatment (Fig. 5F). Since TMAC2 was highly expressed in roots (Fig. 1C), we further examined the effect of TMAC2 on root development. The root length of 35S::TMAC2 and TMAC2-RNAi transgenic plants was compared with that of wild-type plants. As shown in Fig. 6A, the primary root length of 35S::TMAC transgenic plants was markedly shorter than that of wild-type plants, while the length of TMAC2-RNAi transgenic plants was similar to that of wild-type plants. [[FIGURE]]  To determine whether TMAC2-overexpression affects the function of ABA on root elongation, 3-day-old seedlings were grown on the medium with or without ABA for 9 days. After ABA treatment, the root growth of wild-type and TMAC2-RNAi transgenic plants were significantly inhibited (P < 0.001) (Fig. 6B). Interestingly, the primary root length of 35S::TMAC2 transgenic plants on the medium containing 5 μM or 20 μM ABA were longer than those on ABA-free medium and wild-type and TMAC2-RNAi transgenic plants on ABA-containing medium. These results indicated that 35S::TMAC2 transgenic plants exhibited insensitivity to the ABA-mediated inhibition of root elongation. To assess the role of TMAC2 in growth and development, wild-type, TMAC2-overexpressing and RNAi transgenic plants were grown under long-day conditions (16 h light and 8 h dark), and the time of flowering was recorded as the number of rosette leaves present upon the first appearance of flower buds. 35S::TMAC2 and TMAC2-RNAi transgenic plants flowered 46.9 ± 10.1 days and 21.2 ± 1.0 days, on average, respectively, after imbibition, as compared with 20.4 ± 0.9 days, on average, for wild-type plants (Fig. 7A). Consistent with the late-flowering phenotype, the rosette leaf number (mean 25.9 ± 8.7) produced by 35S::TMAC2 transgenic plants was greater than that in TMAC2-RMAi transgenic (mean 9.8 ± 0.54) and wild-type plants (mean 11.4 ± 0.9) (Fig. 7B). [[FIGURE]]  To clarify the molecular basis of the altered flowering phenotype, we examined the expression of flowering-related genes in 35S::TMAC2 transgenic plants. Genes SOC1/AGL20 and SEP3/AGL9 have been reported to be involved in floral initiation (Onouchi et al. CITATION; Pelaz et al. CITATION) in Arabidopsis. The RT-PCR analysis showed that the levels of SOC1/AGL20 and SEP3/AGL9 expression were lower in both 35S::TAMC2 independent lines than in wild-type plants (Fig. 7C). These results suggest that the alteration of flowering time observed in 35S::TMAC2 transgenic plants is associated with the downregulation of these genes. Since the TMAC2 transcript was mainly detected in the veins of leaves (Fig. 2A), we examined whether TMAC2 plays a role in carbohydrate metabolism. We determined the starch content in leaves because starch is the major source of carbohydrates and the principal way plants store energy. After 12 days of germination on half-strength MS medium, the starch of seedlings was stained with iodine after the dark photoperiod. Surprisingly, the leaves of 35S::TMAC2 transgenic plants were stained darker than those of wild-type and TMAC2-RNAi transgenic plants (Fig. 7A). Figure 7B shows the starch content of 35S::TMAC2 transgenic plants being about 3-fold more than that of wild-type and TMAC2-RNAi transgenic plants. Gene SEX1 (STARCH EXCESS 1) is known to be a general regulator of starch degradation in Arabidopsis (Yu et al. CITATION), therefore we checked the expression level of SEX1 in 35S::TMAC2 transgenic plants. RT-PCR analysis showed that the level of SEX1 expression was reduced in 35S::TMAC2 transgenic plants (Fig. 8C). Starch is an important source of carbohydrates, and breakdown of starch provides the energy for plant growth and avoidance of sugar starvation (Smith et al. CITATION). Since 35S::TMAC2 transgenic plants showed an impaired ability to degrade starch, we further examined the expression of two sugar starvation-induced genes, DIN2 and DIN11 (Fujiki et al. CITATION). As shown in Fig. 8C, the level of DIN2 and DIN11 was significantly up-regulated in 35S::TMAC2 transgenic plants. [[FIGURE]] 
!~MM~! Seeds of Arabidopsis thaliana (Columbia ecotype) were surface sterilized for 2 min in 70% ethanol and 20 min in 1% sodium hypochlorite. After three washes with sterile water, seeds were sown on half-strength Murashige and Skoog (MS) salt medium (Murashige and Skoog CITATION) supplemented with 1% sucrose and 0.9% agar. The plants were grown in a daily cycle of 16 h of light (70 μmol m−2 s−1) and 8 h of dark at 22°C after 2-day vernalization. For ABA , NaCl and PEG treatments, 2-week-old seedlings grown on half-strength MS plates were transferred to filter paper saturated with 100 μM ABA (mixed isomers, ±cis/trans; Sigma), 300 mM NaCl or 30% polyethylene glycol (PEG, molecular weight 6,000) and incubated at 22°C under dim light for 3 h. For cold treatment, seedlings were collected after 2 weeks’ germination on half-strength MS plates and incubated on ice under dim light for 24 h. After ABA and abiotic treatment, the seedlings were used for RNA extraction. Total RNA of seedlings and flower buds was extracted by use of the RNeasy Plant Mini Kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Total RNA of seeds, roots and rosette leaves of adult plants and siliques was isolated by the Pine Tree Method (Chang et al. CITATION). For Northern blot analysis, the probe specific for TMAC2 was amplified by RT-PCR with the forward primer 5′-TCAGAGAAGACGAGGGCATTTA-3′ and reverse primer 5′-CATCGTTACATTTTGAAAGTTAGGG-3′ and labeled with [alpha-32P]dCTP by use of a random primer DNA labeling kit (RediPrime DNA Labelling System, Amersham). Before the cDNA fragment was used as a probe, it had undergone Southern analysis to confirm its gene specificity. After hybridization at 42°C for overnight, membranes were washed twice in 2× SSC, 0.1% SDS at room temperature for 30 min and once in 0.1× SSC, 0.1% SDS at 42°C for 30 min. After DNase treatment, total RNA (3 μg) was reverse transcribed with SUPERSCRIPTTM III Reverse Trascriptase (Invitrogen) in a reaction volume of 20 μl to generate the first-strand cDNA. PCR was subsequently performed in 15 μl of PCR mixture containing 150 ng first-strand synthesis cDNA. The PCR cycling parameters for TMAC2 were as follows: initial denaturation at 94°C for 3 min, followed by 23 cycles of 94°C for 60 s, 51°C for 45 s, 72°C for 45 s, and final elongation at 72°C for 5 min. For amplification of the other genes, these parameters were kept constant except for the cycle numbers which were optimized for each gene-specific primer pairs. The cycling numbers for RD29A, COR47, SOC1/AGL20, SEP3/AGL9, SEX1, DIN2, DIN11 and ACTIN2 were 20, 16, 30, 30, 22, 30, 30 and 30 cycles, respectively. The PCR products were separated by electrophoresis on 1% agarose gel and stained with ethidium bromide. The gene-specific primer pairs used for the RT-PCR were as follows: RD29A, 5′-CAGAGGAGCCAAAACAGAGCAC-3′ and 5′-TTCTTAATCCAAAGCCGAACAA-3′; COR47, 5′-CGAGCGATGAAGAAGGTGAGG-3′ and 5′-CAAATGCAATCAACGAAAGCC-3′; TMAC2, 5′-TCAGAGAAGACGAGGGCATTTA-3′ and 5′-CATCGTTACATTTTGAAAGTTAGGG-3′; SOC1/AGL20, 5′-GAGGCATACTAAGGATCGAGTCAG-3′ and 5′-CGTCTCTACTTCAGAACTTGGGC-3′; SEP3/AGL9, 5′-AACCCAATGTGCCTTCAAGAG-3′ and 5′-CCTGCTCCCATTCCATCTTG-3′; SEX1, 5′-CCTTGATTCGCCTCTGGTG-3′ and 5′-TGGTAATGCCAAATGTCTTTGTAC-3′; DIN2, 5′-AGCTCTTGCCTTTGAAATTGG-3′and 5′-TTACGTCACACCCATCTTCCAC-3′; DIN11, 5′-GGACATCGGAAAGGTCTTGG-3′and 5′-CAATTACCATCCAAAGCCCATC-3′. The Arabidopsis Actin2 (locus number At3g18780) was amplified using primers 5′-CTAAGCTCTCAAGATCAAAGGCTTA-3′ and 5′-TTAACATTGCAAAGAGTTTCAAGGT-3′ and used as an internal control. The overexpression and RNAi constructs were made in a binary vector pBI121-GUSless modified from vector pBI121 (BD Biosciences Clontech) and without the GUS gene (Fig. 4A). To generate the overexpression construct of the TMAC2 coding region, TMAC2 full-length cDNA was generated by RT-PCR with the following primers having a BglII site (underlined): 5′-AGATCTAACGTTTCTCCCTTCTCTTTCG-3′ and 5′-AGATCTCATCGTTACATTTTGAAAGTTAGGG-3′. The PCR product was confirmed by DNA sequencing and subsequently cloned into the BamHI site of modified binary vector pBI121-GUSless (Fig. 4A) under the control of the constitutive cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter to generate 35S::TMAC2. To construct RNAi transgenic lines of TMAC2, a SalI-BglII fragment (302-bp) from TMAC2 full-length cDNA was fused with a BamHI-BglII spacer fragment (229-bp) from plasmid pSEAP-Basic (BD Biosciences Clontech) and cloned into the SalI site of pBI121-GUSless to create an inverted-repeat construct (Fig. 4A). For generation of the TMAC2::β-glucuronidase (GUS) fusion, the 1.8-kb 5′ promoter region of TMAC2 was fused to a GUS gene. The promoter was obtained by PCR from the genomic DNA with the following primers: forward primer with HindIII (underlined) 5′-AAGCTTCCAACAAAGCAGAAACAGCCC-3′ and reverse primer with BamHI (underlined) 5′-GGATCCTTCCCCTGCCTCTTATCATCTCC-3′. The promoter sequence was confirmed by DNA sequencing and cloned into a binary vector pBI101 (BD Biosciences Clontech) between the HindIII and BamHI sites. These constructs were introduced into Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain LBA4404 (Hoekema et al. CITATION) and then transformed into Arabidopsis (Columbia ecotype) plants according to the floral dip method (Clough and Bent CITATION). Transgenic lines transformed with these constructs were selected with use of kanamycin. Selected plants were propagated by self-pollination to obtain homozygous T4 generation plants. Histochemical GUS staining was performed as previously described (Jefferson et al. CITATION). Briefly, seedlings treated with ABA and various tissues of TMAC2::GUS transgenic plants were incubated in staining buffer containing 1 mM 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-glucuronic acid (X-GlcA), 100 mM sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, 0.1 mM EDTA, 0.5 mM ferricyanide, 3 mM ferrocyanide and 0.1% Triton X-100. After a vacuum was applied for 5–10 min, samples were incubated in the dark at 37°C for 16 h. Chlorophyll was cleared from the plant tissues by immersing the samples in 70% ethanol. Three independent experiments were performed and the results were comparable. The results from one experiment are shown. The TMAC2 coding region was amplified by RT-PCR with the following primers having BglII (underlined): forward primer, 5′-AGATCTAACGTTTCTCCCTTCTCTTTCG-3′ and reverse primer, 5′-AGATCTGATAGAAGAAGAAGGAAGTTTAAC-3′. The PCR product was confirmed by DNA sequencing and cloned into the BamHI site of a GFP expression vector (HBT-SGFP-TYG-nos plasmid) (Sheen et al. CITATION) to create the TMAC2-GFP fusion. The TMAC2-GFP fusion was introduced into Arabidopsis protoplasts by PEG-mediated transfection (Hwang and Sheen CITATION). Stomatal apertures were measured as described previously by Kwak et al. (CITATION). Leaves of 3-week-old plants were incubated in stomatal opening buffer (5 mM KCl, 50 μM CaCl2 and 10 mM Mes/Tris, pH 6.15) for 3 h in white light (fluence rate of 70 μmol m−2 s−1) to promote stomatal opening. Stomatal apertures were measured after ABA was added for 3 h. Average stomatal aperture was determined from measurements of 50–100 stomata. For starch staining, whole seedlings were incubated in 80% ETOH at 80°C to remove the chlorophyll and subsequently stained with I2-KI (5.7 mM iodine and 43.4 mM potassium iodine in 0.2 N HCl). Quantitative starch assays were employed as described by Ebell (CITATION) with the following modifications. An amount of 0.15 g of fresh leaves was ground in 1 ml 80% ETOH and extracted three times at 80°C. The pellet was dried, resuspended with 100 μl of 0.2 N KOH and boiled for 30 min. After neutralization with 20 μl acetic acid, the sample was treated with 0.5 unit amyloglucosidase (Sigma) in 900 μl of 0.1 M acetic acid, pH 4.8, at 55°C for 1 h. The reaction was stopped by boiling for 5 min, and glucose in the solution was determined by adding 10 μl of 21 mM o-dianisidine, 0.5 unit glucose oxidase and 0.5 unit peroxidase (all from Sigma). The starch content was measured at OD500 after incubation at 37°C for 30 min.
