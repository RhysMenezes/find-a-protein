!~ABS~! MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play key regulatory roles in numerous developmental and physiological processes in animals and plants. The elaborate mechanism of miRNA biogenesis involves transcription and multiple processing steps. Here, we report the identification of a pair of evolutionarily conserved NOT2_3_5 domain–containing-proteins, NOT2a and NOT2b (previously known as At-Negative on TATA less2 [NOT2] and VIRE2-INTERACTING PROTEIN2, respectively), as components involved in Arabidopsis thaliana miRNA biogenesis. NOT2 was identified by its interaction with the Piwi/Ago/Zwille domain of DICER-LIKE1 (DCL1), an interaction that is conserved between rice (Oryza sativa) and Arabidopsis thaliana. Inactivation of both NOT2 genes in Arabidopsis caused severe defects in male gametophytes, and weak lines show pleiotropic defects reminiscent of miRNA pathway mutants. Impairment of NOT2s decreases the accumulation of primary miRNAs and mature miRNAs and affects DCL1 but not HYPONASTIC LEAVES1 (HYL1) localization in vivo. In addition, NOT2b protein interacts with polymerase II and other miRNA processing factors, including two cap binding proteins, CBP80/ABH1, CBP20, and SERRATE (SE). Finally, we found that the mRNA levels of some protein coding genes were also affected. Therefore, these results suggest that NOT2 proteins act as general factors to promote the transcription of protein coding as well as miRNA genes and facilitate efficient DCL1 recruitment in miRNA biogenesis.
!~RES~! Our previous work demonstrated that Os-DCL1 is a key enzyme in rice miRNA biogenesis (CITATION). The Piwi/Ago/Zwille (PAZ) domain, a conserved functional domain of DCL1, recognizes the end of the double-stranded RNA, allowing DCL1 to measure and generate small RNAs of the correct size (CITATION). To further study the precise mechanism of rice miRNA biogenesis, we selected the PAZ domain as a bait to screen for potential interacting partners associated with DCL1. From this yeast two-hybrid screen, we identified the C-terminal region (305 to 622 amino acids) of Os-NOT2 (Os-NOT2p) as being represented by positive clones at the highest frequency. To further substantiate the interaction between Os-NOT2 and Os-DCL1, we used stable coexpression of AD-Os-DCL1 PAZ and BD-Os-NOT2p in yeast and found this combination activated the ADE2, HIS3, and lacZ reporter genes, further confirming the bona fide interaction between Os-DCL1 and Os-NOT2p (see Supplemental Figure 1A online). To further characterize the biological roles of NOT2 in plants, we first used RNA interference (RNAi) to knock down Os-NOT2 in rice. The transgenic rice with reduced Os-NOT2 levels either could not regenerate from callus or became arrested at an early seedling stage (see Supplemental Figure 1B online), indicating that Os-NOT2 is vital for rice development. The lethality of Os-NOT2 RNAi in transgenic rice restricted further study of Os-NOT2; therefore, we next studied the function of NOT2 in Arabidopsis, based on the high sequence conservation of NOT2 proteins between rice and Arabidopsis (CITATION). To determine whether the interactions between NOT2a or NOT2b and DCL1 exist in Arabidopsis, we used yeast two-hybrid assays. We generated the appropriate constructs with the Arabidopsis proteins and cotransformed them into yeast. We found that Arabidopsis NOT2a and NOT2b both interact with DCL1 PAZ in yeast (Figure 1A, left panels). To further verify this interaction, we performed pull-down assays using maltose binding protein (MBP)-His–tagged NOT2a or NOT2b as a bait and glutathione S-transferase (GST)–tagged DCL1 PAZ as a prey. Nickel pull-down and immunoblotting assays showed that both NOT2a and NOT2b capture DCL1 PAZ-GST efficiently in vitro compared with GST alone (Figure 1B). [[FIGURE]] The similarities between NOT2a and NOT2b prompted us to test the relationship of these two proteins. Extensive interactions between NOT2a and NOT2a, NOT2b and NOT2b, as well as NOT2a and NOT2b were detected in yeast two-hybrid assays. The results indicated that both NOT2 proteins can form heterodimers or homodimers and may act as a functional unit in vivo (Figure 1A, right panels). In the following experiments, NOT2b is used as a representative to explore the function of NOT2 proteins. We first used protein deletions to determine which domain of NOT2 interacts with DCL1. The NOT2_3_5 domain, a conserved motif of Os-NOT2 proteins, is responsible for interaction with the PAZ domain of Os-DCL1 according to our yeast two-hybrid assay (Figure 1A). The NOT2_3_5 domain of CNOT2 (human homolog of NOT2) has been found to act as a repressor of promoters in reporter gene activity assays using in vitro transient transfections of human cells (CITATION). Thus, we examined if the conserved domain of Arabidopsis NOT2 contributes to the interaction with DCL1. Three versions of MBP-His–tagged NOT2b, including full-length NOT2b (NOT2b), full-length NOT2 with the NOT2_3_5 domain deleted (△NOT2_3_5), and the NOT2_3_5 domain only (NOT2_3_5) (Figure 1C, top panels), were expressed for pull-down assays. The protein that lacks the NOT2_3_5 motif (△NOT2_3_5) did not show an interaction with DCL1 PAZ, but NOT2_3_5 itself completely retained this association (Figure 1C, bottom panel). The data thus indicate that the C-terminal NOT2_3_5 domain mediates the interaction with DCL1. The interaction between DCL1 and NOT2b was also confirmed by examination of their subcellular locations, using protein fusions with fluorescent markers transiently expressed in epidermal cells of N. benthamiana. The yellow fluorescent protein (YFP)–tagged DCL1 localized in the nucleus, which is consistent with previous reports (CITATION; CITATION). When DCL1-YFP and NOT2b–red fluorescent protein (RFP) were coexpressed, NOT2b signals clearly overlapped with those of DCL1-YFP (Figure 1D). Collectively, these results indicated that NOT2 proteins physically associate with DCL1 in rice and Arabidopsis and the NOT2_3_5 domain is critical for the direct interaction. To determine the physiological roles of NOT2a and NOT2b, we identified the T-DNA insertion mutants not2a-1, not2a-2, and not2b-1 from the SALK or Nottingham Arabidopsis Stock Centre collections. not2b-1 is a null allele, and not2a-1 and not2a-2 are weak alleles with reduced NOT2a transcript levels (Figure 2A). Under normal growth conditions, the not2 single mutants did not display any obvious developmental defects. However, we failed to obtain the not2a-2 not2b-1 double mutant, implying that the homozygous double mutant is likely unable to survive. [[FIGURE]] To confirm this hypothesis, we examined the fertility of NOT2a-2+/− 2b-1−/− plants, which should produce homozygous mutants as 25% of their progeny. Indeed, we found some aborted ovules in the siliques of NOT2a-2+/− 2b-1−/− (Figure 2B). We classified these mutants as weak, medium, and severe based on the length of siliques, which corresponded to the ratio of aborted ovules ranging from 32.4 to 67.1% (see Supplemental Table 1 online). We further examined whether the not2 mutant alleles were transmitted through the male and female gametophytes at the expected frequency. Statistical analysis of the progeny of reciprocal crosses to the wild type with NOT2a-2+/− 2b-1−/− or NOT2a-2−/− 2b-1+/− plants demonstrated that the transmission of the not2a-2 and not2b-1 alleles occurs at lower frequencies in both female and male gametophytes (Table 1). The female gametophyte transmission showed a moderate decrease from the expected 50 to 24.7% in NOT2a-2+/− 2b-1−/− plants (Table 1), indicating that both NOT2a and NOT2b are important for normal female gametophyte development in Arabidopsis. However, the transmission of not2a-2 and not2b-1 through the male gamete was 0.9 and 0%, respectively, instead of the expected 50% in the wild type, implying that absence of the homozygous double mutants is largely due to defects in male gametogenesis (Table 1). Also, staining the anthers of NOT2a-2+/− 2b-1−/− plants with Alexander’s stain (CITATION) revealed 43.7 to 10.6% nonviable pollen; in the wild type, there was <1% abnormal pollen (Figure 2C) (see Supplemental Table 2 online). We next examined pollen formation in the mutants to determine the nature of the defect. During Arabidopsis microgametogenesis, meiosis of the microspore mother cell produces a tetrad of microspores. After release from the tetrad, each microspore undergoes an asymmetric cell division, pollen mitosis I, to generate a bicellular pollen grain containing a generative cell and a much larger vegetative cell. Then the generative cell performs a second cell division, pollen mitosis II, to give rise to a tricellular pollen (CITATION; CITATION). To further determine at which stage(s) the aberrant pollen grains of NOT2a-2+/− 2b-1−/− were arrested, 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) staining was applied to observe the pollen nuclei at different developmental stages. We observed degenerated and aberrant pollen grains that did not stain with DAPI at the tricellular, bicellular, and microspore stages in NOT2a-2+/− 2b-1−/− plants (Figure 2D), indicating that male gamete defects occur at or before pollen mitosis I. The functional roles of NOT2s in reproductive cells are also consistent with their high expression in carpels and stamens (see Supplemental Figure 2 online). These results suggest redundant roles of NOT2a and NOT2b in early male and female gametophyte development. We also isolated a weak double mutant, not2a-1 not2b-1, which exhibits pleiotropic phenotypes, including crumpled and serrated rosette leaves and late flowering (Figures 3A and 3B). These phenotypes are similar to those of miRNA biogenesis pathway mutants, such as dcl1, hyl1, se, and cbp80/abh1 (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION). To further confirm the abnormal phenotypes of loss of function of both NOT2a and NOT2b, we generated transgenic plants with knockdown of NOT2b in the not2a-2 background. Two lines designated as RNAi-1 and RNAi-2 showed slightly enhanced phenotypes similar to not2a-1 not2b-1 (Figure 3B). These observations suggested that the defects in the not2a-1 not2b-1 mutants are due to loss of function of both NOT2a and NOT2b. [[FIGURE]] The combined evidence that NOT2 binds DCL1 and that the phenotype of not2a-1 not2b-1 is reminiscent of miRNA biogenesis pathway mutants prompted us to test whether miRNAs were affected by inactivation of NOT2s. Indeed, we found that in not2a-1 not2b-1 or RNAi lines, all nine tested miRNAs were reduced in abundance by 1.4- to 2.7-fold relative to the wild type (Figure 3C). miRNA biogenesis is a sequential process, proceeding mainly through three steps: transcription of pri-miRNA, pri-miRNA processing to pre-miRNA, and pre-miRNA processing to mature miRNA. To determine how miRNA biogenesis was affected by NOT2, we first examined the levels of pri-miRNAs. Quantitative RT-PCR revealed that the levels of pri-miRNAs at five MIR loci (MIR158a, MIR159a, MIR164b, MIR167a, and MIR168a) were reduced by nearly twofold in not2a-1 not2b-1 and RNAi lines (Figure 3D). This observation is in contrast with dcl1, hyl1, se, and cbp80/cbp20 mutants, in which pri-miRNA transcripts accumulate to much higher levels than the wild type (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION). This suggested that NOT2a and NOT2b are likely involved in transcriptional regulation of MIR genes. To confirm that NOT2s regulate miRNA transcription, we used a β-glucuronidase (GUS) reporter to test the effect of mutation of NOT2s on GUS expression driven by the MIR172a promoter (CITATION). The transgenic plants containing pMIR172a:GUS were crossed to not2a-1 not2b-1. The individuals containing pMIR172a:GUS, along with either NOT2a-1+/− 2b-1+/− or not2a-1 not2b-1, were isolated from the F2 population for GUS staining. GUS expression was markedly decreased in not2a-1 not2b-1 compared with NOT2a+/− 2b+/− (see Supplemental Figure 3 online, top panels). By contrast, GUS expression driven by the promoter of a protein coding gene, PISTILLATA (PI) (CITATION), did not exhibit reduction in the two genotypes (see Supplemental Figure 3 online, bottom panels). These results indicated that NOT2s promote MIR transcription. Next, we tested how NOT2s regulate MIR transcription. MIR genes are predominately transcribed by Pol II (CITATION; CITATION); we therefore examined the interaction between NOT2b and Pol II by pull-down assays. The purified MBP-His–tagged NOT2b protein on beads was incubated with a crude protein extract of wild-type Arabidopsis seedlings, and immunoblotting was conducted to determine whether Pol II was retained by the beads. Pol II (detected by anti-NRPB1 [RNA Pol II largest subunit] antibody) was coprecipitated with MBP-His–tagged NOT2b but not with MBP-His only (Figure 3E). Furthermore, a pull-down experiment was performed using MBP-His–tagged NOT2b (NOT2b-MBP-His) as the bait and GST-tagged C-terminal domain of NRPB1 (designated as CTD-GST) as the prey. Nickel pull-down and immunoblotting showed retention of NOT2b-MBP-His along with CTD-GST but not with the GST control, indicating that NOT2b interacts directly with the CTD of Pol II (Figure 3F). This result provided further support for the interaction between NOT2 and Pol II. Thus, we conclude that NOT2s promote MIR expression via interacting with Pol II. In Arabidopsis, pri-miRNAs are transcribed by Pol II and subsequently form fold-back structures to recruit proteins necessary for their posttranscriptional processing. DCL1, HYL1, and SE interact and colocalize with each other, forming a pri-miRNA processing and/or storage complex, or center (CITATION). The observation that NOT2 physically associated with DCL1 and Pol II suggested that NOT2 might act as a scaffold to bridge miRNA transcription and DCL1 recruitment. We used bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) to determine whether NOT2 can also interact with other proteins involved in pri-miRNA processing (CITATION). As a positive control, we found that HYL1 interacts with SE in discrete foci in the nucleoplasm (see Supplemental Figure 4A online), which is consistent with previously published observations (CITATION). Intriguingly, we observed that intense BiFC fluorescence appeared when NOT2b was coexpressed with SE, CBP20, and CBP80 (Figure 4A), but BiFC fluorescence was not observed for the NOT2b/DDL and NOT2b/HYL1 pairs (Figure 4A). Independent assays by yeast two-hybrid and pull down also confirmed that NOT2 associated with SE, CBP20, and CBP80, but not with DDL or HYL1 (Figures 4B and 4C). Consistent with previous studies, we also observed that CBP20 interacts with CBP80 in vivo and thus is part of the CBP complex (CBC) (see Supplemental Figure 4B online, top panels) (CITATION). Additionally, we showed that CBP20, but not CBP80, binds SE in vivo and in vitro, which further supports the hypothesis that CBC and SE share common molecular functions (CITATION) (see Supplemental Figures 4B to 4D online). These data suggested that CBP20 may affect miRNA biogenesis by binding SE directly. Therefore, the CBC might be required for forming a pri-miRNA processing center by interacting with SE directly or indirectly. [[FIGURE]] DCL1, HYL1, CBP20/80, and SE proteins are involved in pri-miRNA processing and they interact with each other directly or indirectly. NOT2 protein interacts with DCL1, SE, CBP20, and CBP80; therefore, we proposed that NOT2 may assist in the recruitment of these components to form an efficient processing center. To test this hypothesis, we examined the effects of NOT2 impairment on the localization of two major miRNA processing components, DCL1 and HYL1. A previous study revealed that DCL1-YFP–containing bodies distribute throughout the nucleoplasm and ∼79% of plant cells harbor two or fewer DCL1-YFP speckles in wild-type Arabidopsis (CITATION). We used the F2 population generated from transgenic plants expressing DCL1-YFP or HYL1-YFP crossed to the not2a-1 not2b-1 double mutant and counted the number of DCL1-YFP or HYL1-YFP bodies in each root cell in the wild type and not2a-1 not2b-1 backgrounds. In the wild type, most cells contained one or two DCL1-YFP speckles (Figure 5A, left panels), consistent with a previous report (CITATION). By contrast, we observed three to four DCL1-YFP speckles in not2a-1 not2b-1 root cells (Figure 5A, right panels). Statistical analysis based on observations of 657 and 417 nuclei of the wild type and not2a-1 not2b-1, respectively, showed a significant increase in DCL1-YFP speckle number in the not2 double mutant (Figure 5B). By contrast, the numbers of HYL1-YFP speckles were not significantly increased in not2a-1 not2b-1 compared with that in the wild type root cells (Figures 5D and 5E). We also analyzed DCL1-YFP and HYL1-YFP expression and both showed equivalent induction (∼1.5-fold, P < 0.05) in not2a-1 not2b-1 (Figures 5C and 5F), which rules out the possibility that the increased number of DCL1-YFP speckles was due to upregulation of DCL1-YFP expression. Based on its positive regulatory role on MIR transcription and its interaction with multiple miRNA processing factors, we propose that NOT2 coordinates the recruitment of DCL1 bodies onto pri-miRNAs subsequent to MIR transcription; loss of NOT2 probably leads to the mislocalization of its direct interaction partner DCL1 but not HYL1, which does not interact with NOT2 directly. [[FIGURE]] The association between NOT2 and Pol II raised the question of whether NOT2s affect pri-miRNAs specifically or act as general factors in transcription. To address this question, we performed high-throughput RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) using RNA samples from not2a-1 not2b-1 and wild-type seedlings. The data quality is summarized in Supplemental Table 3 online. Compared with wild-type Columbia (Col), several MIR genes were significantly reduced, which is consistent with our quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis (see Supplemental Figure 5A online; Figure 3D). We also found 634 downregulated and 366 upregulated genes in not2a-1 not2b-1, respectively (P < 0.01, fold change > 2) (see Supplemental Data Set 1 and Supplemental Figure 5B online). The expression levels of some downregulated genes were validated in not2a-1 not2b-1 mutants and RNAi lines (see Supplemental Figure 5C online). We found that the expression of 14 selected genes (with low P value and high expression) was significantly reduced in the mutant or RNAi lines, indicating that NOT2 might be a general factor associated with Pol II, promoting transcription at both MIR and protein coding genes.
!~MM~! All Arabidopsis thaliana lines used in this study were in the Col ecotype. Plants were grown under long photoperiod conditions (16 h light/8 h dark) at 23°C. Seedlings were grown on Murashige and Skoog plates containing 3% Suc and 0.8% agar. The mutants of not2a-1 (SALK_062057), not2b-1 (SALK_058645), and not2a-2 (GABI_104B08) were obtained from SALK (ABRC) and the European Arabidopsis Stock Centre collections, respectively. The mutant cbp80 (SALK_016753) was described previously (CITATION). Rice (Oryza sativa) transformation and regeneration were performed as previously published (CITATION). The DCL1-YFP or HYL1-YFP/not2a-1 not2b-1 lines were obtained by crossing DCL1-YFP or HYL1-YFP/Col (CITATION) with not2a-1 not2b-1 plants. In the F2 population, plants with the genotype NOT2a+/+ NOT2+/+ and NOT2a−/− NOT2−/− were selected for further observation. pMIR172a:GUS and pPI:GUS (CITATION) were introduced into not2a-1 nto2b-1 by the same approach. For yeast two-hybrid assays, the full-length or partial coding regions of Os-DCL1 PAZ, DCL1 PAZ, NOT2a, NOT2b, CBP20, and DDL were PCR amplified using the primers listed in Supplemental Table 4 online. The fragments were fused in frame with the GAL4 DNA binding domain (pGBKT7/BD/XF117) or activation domain (pGADT7/AD/XF118). All the recombinant plasmid pairs were cotransformed into the yeast strain AH109. Yeast transformation was performed following the manufacturer’s handbook (Clontech Yeast Protocols Handbook). The cotransformed yeast clones were first grown on SD/-Leu/-Trp medium and subsequently plated on SD/-Ade/-His/-Leu/-Trp medium containing 40 µg/mL X-α-Gal. For pull-down assays, the coding sequences of NOT2a and NOT2b were inserted in frame into the expression vector pMAL-C2-MBP (XF510) as the bait, and the DCL1 PAZ, CBP20, CBP80, DDL, and Pol II NRPB1 CTD coding sequences were cloned into the expression vector pGEX4T-1(XF156) or pMAL-C2-GST (XF760) as prey proteins. pMAL-C2-MBP and pMAL-C2-GST are a family of compatible ligation-independent cloning vectors, which are suitable for construction of recombinant protein expression vectors independent of ligation (CITATION). The primer sequences are listed in Supplemental Table 4 online. All the MBP-His–tagged or GST-tagged recombinant proteins were affinity purified from Escherichia coli BL21 codon-plus RIL strain (BL21 CP, Stratagene) with extra copies of E. coli argU, ileY, and LeuW tRNA genes. Nickel pull-down assays were performed as previously described (CITATION), except that His-tag Dynabeads (101.04D; Invitrogen) were used. Briefly, the pellet of BL21 with expressed proteins was resuspended in 1× His binding buffer (50 mM sodium phosphate, pH 8.0, 300 mM NaCl, and 0.01% Tween 20). Then, the culture lysate was incubated with 50 μL (2 mg) Dynabeads on a rotator for 5 to 10 min at room temperature. The beads with immobilized bait proteins were washed thoroughly four times with 300 μL binding buffer and resuspended with 1× pull-down buffer (3.25 mM sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, 70 mM NaCl, and 0.01% Tween 20). GST-tagged prey proteins were purified by glutathione sepharose beads and eluted with buffer containing 10 mM reduced glutathione. Prior to incubating with prey proteins, equal amounts of baits were blocked with 10% BSA in 1× His binding buffer. Equal amounts (2 µg) of the bait and prey recombinant proteins were incubated in 1× pull-down buffer for 1 h at 4°C, and after extensive washing (1× binding buffer with 400 mM NaCl and 0.5% ICA-630), the bound GST fusion proteins were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE and subjected to immunoblotting assay using α-GST primary antibody and subsequently the horseradish peroxidase–conjugated mouse secondary antibody (31430; Pierce). For detection of the interaction between NOT2 and Pol II, wild-type Arabidopsis total crude extract was used as prey. Proteins were separated with NuPAGE Novex 3 to 8% Tris-Acetate Gel (EA0375BOX; Invitrogen), then immunoblotting analysis was performed using primary antibodies against NRPB1 (ab5408; Abcam) and the horseradish peroxidase–conjugated anti-mouse secondary antibody (31430; Pierce). NOT2a/b genomic DNA regions were PCR amplified and cloned into the Gateway pENTR/D-TOPO vector (11791-020 and 45-0218; Life Technologies) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The resulting plasmids were recombined with pGWB3 (XF1379) (for GUS fusion of NOT2a and NOT2b). Histochemical GUS staining was performed according to the standard procedure (CITATION) with a modified buffer, which contains 1 mg/mL 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-glucuronic acid cyclohexylammonium salt, 50 mM sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, 0.1% Triton X-100, 2 mM potassium ferrocyanide, 2 mM potassium ferricyanide, and 10 mM EDTA. Plant tissues were incubated in the buffer at 37°C in the dark. Prior to observation, tissues were cleared with ethanol. Total RNAs were extracted from 12-d-old seedlings of the wild type and not2a-1 not2b-1 using TRIzol reagent (DP405-02; Tiangen). Polyadenylated RNAs were isolated using a Dynabeads mRNA purification kit (610-06; Invitrogen). RNA-seq libraries were prepared using the Illumina Directional mRNA-Seq library prep v1.5 protocol and sequenced on an Illumina GAII to generate high-quality single-end reads of 50 nucleotides in length. The raw reads with strand direction were aligned to the TAIR10 genome using TopHat (CITATION), allowing up to six mismatches. Only uniquely mapped reads were used for subsequent analysis. The gene expression levels were measured in reads per kilobase of exon model per million mapped reads (CITATION). The differentially expressed genes were identified using DEGseq with parameter as twofold change and P < 0.01 (CITATION). Total RNAs were extracted from 12-d-old seedling plants with TRIzol reagent (Tiangen), and the first-strand cDNA was reversed transcribed with anchored oligo(dT) using GoldScript (C81401190; Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The qRT-PCR was performed in the CFX96 real-time system (Bio-Rad). Primers for detecting pri-miRNAs were used as previously described (CITATION). Primer information is listed in Supplemental Table 4 online. Student’s t test significance was calculated as previously published (CITATION), except for the statistical analysis in Figures 5B and 5E, in which the P value was calculated by Wilcoxon-Matt-Whitney test. Small RNAs were enriched by 8 M LiCl from 20 to 30 μg total RNAs for at least 2 h at 4°C. RNA hybridization was performed as previously described (CITATION) with minor modifications. The enriched small RNAs were size separated by 15% SDS-PAGE containing 7 M Urea under denaturing conditions and transferred electrophoretically to Hybond-NX nylon membrane (RPN303T; GE Healthcare), then subjected to chemical cross-linking as previously described (CITATION). Antisense oligonucleotides for specific miRNAs were used as probes for detecting miRNAs, which were 5′-end labeled ([γ-32P]ATP) by T4 polynucleotide kinase (M0201; New England Biolabs). The probe sequences are listed in Supplemental Table 5 online. Radioactive signals were quantified with ImageQuant 5.2, and the relative quantitative values were normalized to U6. For pollen analysis, Alexander’s stain was used as previously described (CITATION). Pollen DAPI staining was performed using DAPI solution (0.1 M sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, 1 mM EDTA, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 0.5 mg/mL DAPI). Alexander’s staining and DAPI fluorescence were observed on a microscope equipped with a charge-couple device camera (Olympus DP70). BiFC assays were performed as described (CITATION). The coding regions of NOT2b, DDL, CBP20, and CBP80 were inserted into pCAMBIA1300-YFPN (XF1698) or pCAMBIA1300-YFPC (XF1699), respectively. The recombinant constructs were transformed into the Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain EHA105 and the Agrobacterium cultures were injected into Nicotiana benthamiana leaves. The transfected tobacco leaves were grown at 25°C for 2 to 3 d before observation. The tobacco epidermal cells were then observed with a Leica TCS SP5 confocal laser scanning microscope. For detection of NOT2b subcellular localization, the coding sequence of NOT2b was engineered into pCAMBIA1300-RFP (XF0954). The detailed primer sequences are listed in Supplemental Table 4 online. Agrobacterium strains containing NOT2b-RFP and DCL1-YFP were used to cotransfect N. benthamiana. The visualization of DCL1-YFP in Arabidopsis was observed using the Zeiss LSM 710 NLO confocal laser scanning microscope.
