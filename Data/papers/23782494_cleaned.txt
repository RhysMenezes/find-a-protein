!~ABS~! The endoplasmic reticulum (ER)‐resident BAX INHIBITOR‐1 (BI‐1) protein is one of a few cell death suppressors known to be conserved in animals and plants. The function of BI‐1 proteins in response to various biotic and abiotic stress factors is well established. However, little is known about the underlying mechanisms. We conducted co‐immunoprecipitation (co‐IP) experiments to identify Arabidopsis thaliana BI‐1‐interacting proteins to obtain a potentially better understanding of how BI‐1 functions during plant–pathogen interactions and as a suppressor of cell death. Liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry (LC‐MS/MS) identified 95 proteins co‐immunoprecipitated with green fluorescing protein (GFP)‐tagged BI‐1. Five selected candidate proteins, a RIBOPHORIN II (RPN2) family protein, VACUOLAR ATP SYNTHASE SUBUNIT A (VHA‐A), cytochrome P450 83A1 (CYP83A1), H+‐ATPASE 1 (AHA1) and PROHIBITIN 2 (PHB2), were further investigated with regard to their role in BI‐1‐associated processes. To this end, we analysed a set of Arabidopsis mutants in the interaction with the adapted powdery mildew fungus Erysiphe cruciferarum and on cell death‐inducing treatments. Two independent rpn2 knock‐down mutants tended to better support powdery mildew, and a phb2 mutant showed altered responses to cell death‐inducing Alternaria alternata f.sp. lycopersici (AAL) toxin treatment. Two independent cyp83a1 mutants showed a strong powdery mildew resistance phenotype and enhanced sensitivity to AAL toxin. Moreover, co‐localization studies and fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) experiments suggested a direct interaction of BI‐1 with CYP83A1 at the ER. 
!~RES~! In order to identify interaction partners of Arabidopsis BI‐1, co‐IP was performed using BI‐1‐GFP‐expressing Arabidopsis mutants. Empty vector Bin19 mutants served as control plants (Kawai‐Yamada et al., CITATION). Both Arabidopsis mutants were either noninoculated or inoculated with adapted E. cruciferarum and nonadapted B. graminis f.sp. hordei, respectively. The total protein input for co‐IP was extracted from a pool of all variants in order to gain as many putative BI‐1‐interacting proteins as possible. BI‐1‐GFP and putative interaction partners were co‐immunoprecipitated using GFP‐binding agarose beads and identified by liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry (LC‐MS/MS), in conjunction with database searching against the viridiplantae subset of the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) database.  A total of 127 proteins was identified in the BI‐1‐GFP sample, 95 of which were not present in the empty vector control sample. Table S1 (see Supporting Information) lists these 95 BI‐1‐GFP co‐immunoprecipitated proteins. Cowling and Birnboim (CITATION) showed that human BI‐1 can be resistant to trypsin proteolysis. This might explain the detection of only one BI‐1 peptide (AHLGDMDYVK, position 201–212). However, Western blots against GFP showed a successful precipitation of BI‐1‐GFP (Fig. S1, see Supporting Information), and Mascot database search against the whole NCBI database revealed an enrichment of GFP peptides in the BI‐1‐GFP co‐immunoprecipitate, again validating a successful precipitation of BI‐1‐GFP. For first examinations, five putatively membrane‐associated BI‐1‐interacting candidates were selected, predominantly according to their presumed BI‐1‐associated function and predicted subcellular localization: RIBOPHORIN II (RPN2) family protein [syn. HAPLESS 6 (HAP6)], VACUOLAR ATP SYNTHASE SUBUNIT A (VHA‐A), cytochrome P450 83A1 [CYP83A1, syn. REDUCED EPIDERMAL FLUORESCENCE 2 (REF2)], H+‐ATPASE 1 (AHA1) and PROHIBITIN 2 (PHB2) (Table 1). Candidates were selected after a quality check of the respective mass spectra by manual inspection, although not all identified peptides showed significant Mascot ion scores. The five selected putative BI‐1‐interacting proteins are listed in Table 1, including information about the Arabidopsis Genome Initiative (AGI) code, the amino acid sequence of the identified peptides, the Mascot ion score (threshold, 46; at P < 0.05) and the assumed subcellular localization, according to The Arabidopsis Information Resource (TAIR, http://arabidopsis.org) annotation. co‐IP was repeated twice. RPN2, VHA‐A, AHA1 and PHB2 co‐immunoprecipitated with BI‐1‐GFP in all three independent experiments. CYP83A1 was identified in two independent repetitions.  According to TAIR, RPN2/HAP6 is predicted to have dolichyl‐diphosphooligosaccharide‐protein glycotransferase activity as part of the oligosaccharyltransferase (OST) complex catalysing the N‐glycosylation of proteins in the ER (Kang et al., CITATION; Liu and Howell, CITATION). Correct N‐glycosylation is critical for the prevention of ER stress, and Watanabe and Lam (CITATION) have shown a role of BI‐1 in the suppression of ER stress. This might functionally link BI‐1 and RPN2. V‐ATPases can function in the trans‐Golgi network and play essential roles in stress responses (Dettmer et al., CITATION, CITATION; Dietz et al., CITATION). Therefore, we chose the BI‐1‐GFP‐co‐immunoprecipitated VHA‐A as a candidate protein. Recently, Keinath et al. (CITATION) have shown that the AHA1 mutant open stomata 2 is affected in immune signalling triggered by the perception of pathogen‐associated molecular patterns (PAMPs). In barley, plasma membrane H+‐ATPases have been suggested to be involved in HR‐mediated resistance to B. graminis f.sp. hordei (Finni et al., CITATION; Zhou et al., CITATION). However, the identified peptide (Table 1) is also part of AHA2. Another interesting candidate is PHB2. PHBs are involved in the prevention of stress responses and seem to play a major role in cell death‐related mitochondrial function (Di et al., CITATION; Van Aken et al., CITATION, CITATION). In human cells, BI‐1 apparently regulates cell death by interaction with CYP2E1 (Kim et al., CITATION), a homologue of CYP83A1, which we found to co‐precipitate with BI‐1‐GFP. Interestingly, a search of the human CYP2E1 sequence against the A. thaliana database of NCBI identified CYP83A1 as the best hit (28% identity and 48% positives). Therefore, and because P450 monooxygenases are often associated with ER, we included CYP83A1 in further investigations.  To analyse the function of BI‐1‐interacting candidate proteins in a plant–pathogen interaction, we conducted an assay using Arabidopsis mutants predicted to be deficient in the expression of PHB2, RPN2, CYP83A1, AHA1 or VHA‐A, which we inoculated with the adapted powdery mildew fungus E. cruciferarum.  We did not observe PHB2 expression in the two independent PHB2 mutants, phb2‐1 (SALK_004663C) and phb2‐2 (SALK_061282C), using reverse transcription‐polymerase chain reaction (RT‐PCR) (Fig. 1a). However, in phb2‐1, the T‐DNA insertion is in the promoter region, 850 bp upstream of the open reading frame (Fig. S2a, see Supporting Information). Therefore, we cannot exclude a residual expression of PHB2 in this mutant. Microscopic analyses showed a slightly, but not significantly, increased fungal development on both phb2 mutants, 5 days after inoculation (dai), measured as the number of conidiophores per colony (c/c). On the wild‐type Col‐0, the fungus developed an average number of about 20 c/c, whereas the conidiophore production was enhanced to 23 c/c and 25 c/c on phb2‐1 and phb2‐2, respectively (Fig. 1a). At the macroscopic level, we did not observe obvious differences in symptom development on leaves of phb2‐1 and phb2‐2 when compared with Col‐0 (not shown).  [[FIGURE]] As rpn2 loss of function hampers the growth of the pollen tube into the style, only heterozygous rpn2 mutants can be obtained (Johnson et al., CITATION). Both heterozygous rpn2 mutants, rpn2‐1 (SALK_019955C) and rpn2‐2 (SALK_017994C), expressed RPN2 at a clearly reduced level when compared with the wild‐type (Fig. 1b). For the mutant rpn2‐2, we cannot exclude an influence on the expression of At4g21140 (uncharacterized protein), as the T‐DNA insertion is located in the common promoter region of RPN2 (At4g21150) and At4g21140. Both rpn2 mutants were similar, in that they supported a slightly increased fungal development when compared with the wild‐type. The fungus developed 12 c/c on wild‐type Col‐0. On rpn2‐1 and rpn2‐2, E. cruciferarum developed 17 c/c and 19 c/c, respectively (Fig. 1b). This effect was statistically significant for rpn2‐2. At later points in time, leaves of rpn2‐1 and rpn2‐2 seemed to be only slightly more infected by powdery mildew than the wild‐type, as assessed with the naked eye (not shown).  The T‐DNA insertion mutant cyp83a1‐1 (SALK_123405C) did not express CYP83A1 (Fig. 1c), and the loss‐of‐function point mutant cyp83a1‐2 (loss of function by premature stop codon), previously described as ref2‐1, expressed a reduced amount of the mutant transcript (Fig. 1c and Hemm et al., CITATION). The cyp83a1 mutants stood out as a result of a dramatically reduced susceptibility to powdery mildew, which was readily visible with the naked eye (Fig. 1d). Concomitantly, the number of c/c was decreased strongly on both cyp83a1 mutants compared with the wild‐type at 5 dai. Erysiphe cruciferarum developed an average of 36 c/c on Col‐0, and only 1 c/c and 2 c/c on cyp83a1‐1 and cyp83a1‐2, respectively (Fig. 1c).  Hemm et al. (CITATION) demonstrated a reduced level of aliphatic glycosinolates and a slightly increased level of indole‐derived glucosinolates in cyp83a1‐2 (= ref2‐1). To investigate a pathogen‐dependent influence on the glucosinolate composition, we measured the content of several glucosinolates in cyp83a1‐1 and Col‐0 leaves at 5 dai with E. cruciferarum and in noninoculated control leaves. In noninoculated plants, the content of aliphatic glucosinolates was reduced in cyp83a1‐1 relative to wild‐type plants, as described for cyp83a1‐2 (= ref2‐1) (Hemm et al., CITATION). However, under the conditions used, we observed only a marginally enhanced amount of indole‐derived glucosinolates in cyp83a1‐1. A pathogen‐dependent influence on the glucosinolate content was hardly detectable. A tendency for induction by E. cruciferarum could be seen for 4‐methoxy‐indol‐3‐ylmethyl‐glucosinolate at 5 dai in both genotypes (Fig. S3, see Supporting Information).  VHA‐A T‐DNA insertion lines (SALK_081473C, SALK_089595C) and an AHA1 T‐DNA insertion line (SALK_065288C) seemed to be as strongly infected by E. cruciferarum as Col‐0 (data not shown), and were not further analysed in detail.  Overall, at least two of the five investigated BI‐1‐interacting candidate proteins appeared to have functions in the Arabidopsis–E. cruciferarum interaction. Although RPN2 seems to limit fungal development, CYP83A1 is required for the susceptibility of Arabidopsis plants to E. cruciferarum.  To assess whether PHB2, RPN2 and CYP83A1 might be involved in BI‐1‐mediated cell death suppression, Col‐0, cyp83a1‐1, cyp83a1‐2 (= ref2‐1), phb2‐2 and rpn2‐1 were treated with Alternaria alternata f.sp. lycopersici (AAL) toxin to induce cell death. The BI‐1 knock‐out mutant atbi1‐2, which showed enhanced sensitivity to the fungal toxin FB1 and to heat stress relative to wild‐type plants (Watanabe and Lam, CITATION), was included as a positive control. Cell death symptoms were evaluated 9–10 days after AAL toxin application. When compared with wild‐type Col‐0, AAL toxin‐induced lesions were larger on atbi1‐2, cyp83a1‐1, cyp83a1‐2 and phb2‐2 (Fig. 2, for photographs see Fig. S4, Supporting Information). There was no altered sensitivity to AAL toxin application of rpn2‐1 mutant plants relative to Col‐0 (Fig. 2). Control leaves treated with distilled water showed no cell death reactions at all. Thus, mutations of CYP83A1 and PHB2 also apparently alter Arabidopsis cell death responses. In a single experiment, seedlings of atbi1‐2, cyp83a1‐1 and phb2‐2 also showed stronger cell death phenotypes after heat shock relative to Col‐0. rpn2‐1 was slightly less affected after exposure to heat shock, when compared with Col‐0 or atbi1‐2 (data not shown).  [[FIGURE]] Next, we performed co‐localization studies of GFP‐tagged BI‐1 with red fluorescing protein (RFP)‐ or mCherry‐tagged versions of CYP83A1, RPN2 or PHB2 in transiently transformed Nicotiana tabacum cv. Samsun leaf segments.  As already shown by Kawai‐Yamada et al. (CITATION), BI‐1‐GFP localized in the ER and in the nuclear envelope (Fig. 3a). In control cells, soluble RFP served as a marker with localization in the cytoplasm and in the nucleus. Like mammalian prohibitins, Arabidopsis PHB2 is thought to be associated with mitochondria (Millar et al., CITATION; Nijtmans et al., CITATION). We confirmed the localization of PHB2 to mitochondria by the transient expression of PHB2‐RFP in the marker line mt‐gk (Nelson et al., CITATION) (Fig. S5, see Supporting Information). As shown in Fig. 3a, PHB2‐RFP accumulated in mitochondria all over the cell. Co‐localization of BI‐1‐GFP and PHB2‐RFP was visible in small dots, which presumably represent contact points of mitochondria with the ER and the nuclear envelope (Fig. 3a). We observed the same localization pattern after the transient transformation of Arabidopsis epidermal cells via particle bombardment (data not shown).  [[FIGURE]] Cytochrome P450 proteins typically reside in the ER membrane (Schuler and Werck‐Reichhart, CITATION). As ER‐localized CYP79F1 and CYP79F2 synthesize aliphatic aldoximes, which are substrates of CYP83A1, at the ER, CYP83A1 is also suggested to be present in this compartment (Chen et al., CITATION; Nafisi et al., CITATION; Reintanz et al., CITATION). RPN2, as a dolichyl‐diphosphooligosaccharide‐protein glycotransferase, is also predicted to be present in the ER, where N‐glycosylation takes place (Table 1). As predicted, CYP83A1‐mCherry and RPN2‐mCherry fusion proteins accumulated in the ER and around the nucleus in transiently transformed tobacco epidermal cells. Soluble GFP served as a co‐transformed marker for cytosolic and nuclear localization (Fig. 3b,c). Co‐expression of BI‐1‐GFP with either CYP83A1‐mCherry or RPN2‐mCherry resulted in overlapping fluorescence signals (Fig. 3b,c), confirming the accumulation of both putative BI‐1‐interacting proteins in the ER and around the nucleus. Comparative quantitative profiling of the fluorescence intensities of BI‐1‐GFP and either CYP83A1‐mCherry or RPN2‐mCherry further supported their co‐localization (Fig. S6, see Supporting Information). The same localization patterns were observed in transiently transformed Arabidopsis epidermal cells after particle bombardment, but the fluorescence intensities were very low (not shown). Hence, RPN2 and CYP83A1 showed essential co‐localization with BI‐1, which supports the possibility of a physical protein–protein interaction.  cyp83a1 mutants showed strong phenotypes in the interaction with E. cruciferarum and in cell death regulation. To test for a direct interaction between BI‐1 and CYP83A1 at the ER, we conducted fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) measurements by acceptor photobleaching using transiently transformed Arabidopsis epidermal cells. We chemically fixed the transformed leaves before the FRET experiment, because rapid movement of the ER in living cells otherwise provoked artefacts after photobleaching of CYP83A1‐mCherry at a segment of the nuclear envelope. In four independent experiments, we observed a significantly enhanced FRET efficiency in cells co‐expressing BI‐1‐GFP and CYP83A1‐mCherry relative to control cells expressing an ER‐targeted GFP (mGFP5‐ER; Haseloff et al., CITATION; Siemering et al., CITATION) together with CYP83A1‐mCherry (Fig. 4). Co‐IP, co‐localization and FRET experiments thus suggest direct interaction of BI‐1 and CYP83A1 at the ER.  [[FIGURE]]
!~MM~! Arabidopsis thaliana ecotype Col‐0 was purchased from Lehle Seeds (Round Rock, TX, USA). The BI‐1‐GFP‐expressing mutant, the empty Bin19 vector mutant (Kawai‐Yamada et al., CITATION), the BI‐1 knock‐out mutant atbi1‐2 (Watanabe and Lam, CITATION), the cyp83a1 point mutant ref2‐1 (Hemm et al., CITATION), which was renamed to cyp83a1‐2 here, and the marker line mt‐gk (Nelson et al., CITATION) have been described previously. Arabidopsis mutants with T‐DNA insertions in At1g03860 (PHB2; SALK_004663C = phb2‐1 and SALK_061282C = phb2‐2), At4g21150 (RPN2/HAP6; SALK_019955C = rpn2‐1 and SALK_017994C = rpn2‐2), At4g13770 (CYP83A1; SALK_123405C = cyp83a1‐1), At1g78900 (VHA‐A; SALK_081473C and SALK_089595C) and At2g18960 (AHA1; SALK_065288C) were ordered from the Nottingham Arabidopsis Stock Centre (NASC), Nottingham, UK. Primers for semi‐quantitative two‐step RT‐PCR‐based expression analysis and confirmation of T‐DNA insertions are listed in Tables S2 and S3, respectively (see Supporting Information). Gene models showing insert sites of T‐DNA in PHB2, RPN2 and CYP83A1, as well as the primer sites used in RT‐PCR analysis, are displayed in Fig. S2. All Arabidopsis seeds were sown in a soil–sand mixture and stratified for 2 days at 4 °C before placement in a growth chamber at 22 °C, with a photoperiod of 10 h and 64% relative humidity. For Agrobacterium tumefaciens‐mediated transient transformation of tobacco leaf segments, we used N. tabacum cv. Samsun. Tobacco plants were cultivated in a growth chamber at 18 °C, with a photoperiod of 16 h and a relative humidity of 65%.  Erysiphe cruciferarum was maintained on Col‐0 and on super‐susceptible phytoalexin‐deficient pad4 mutants (Reuber et al., CITATION). Plants were inoculated with a density of three to five conidia/mm2, as described previously (Reitz et al., CITATION). Blumeria graminis (DC) Speer f.sp. hordei was maintained on barley cv. Golden Promise in a growth chamber at 18 °C, with a photoperiod of 16 h and a relative humidity of 65%. Inoculation was performed by blowing spores off infected plants.  Four‐week‐old BI‐1‐GFP‐expressing mutants, as well as control plants carrying the empty binary vector Bin19 (Kawai‐Yamada et al., CITATION), were either noninoculated or inoculated with approximately 80 conidia/mm2 of B. graminis f.sp. hordei and 30 conidia/mm2 of E. cruciferarum. Infected plants were harvested 12 h after inoculation together with noninoculated control plants. Total protein was extracted from 10 g of frozen plant material (a pool of each variant) using 10 mL of extraction buffer A [50 mm Tris‐HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 1 tablet PhosStop® (Roche Deutschland Holding GmbH, Grenzach‐Wyhlen, Germany), 1% protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma‐Aldrich Chemie GmbH, Munich, Germany), 0.005% leupeptin, 100 μm sodium orthovanadate, 0.5% TritonX‐100]. After 15 min of incubation on ice, the protein extract was diluted 1:1 with extraction buffer B (extraction buffer A without TritonX‐100) and centrifuged for 10 min at 2900 g. The supernatant was extruded through a 0.45‐μm nylon filter. About 40 mg of protein extract (3 μg/μL) were incubated twice with 100 μL of prewashed (washing buffer A: 50 mm Tris‐HCl, 100 mm NaCl, 0.05% TritonX‐100) Protein A sepharose for 30 min on a rotor at 4 °C. The extract was added to previously washed GFP‐Trap A® beads (ChromoTek, Munich, Germany; Rothbauer et al., CITATION) and incubated on a rotor for 1 h at 4 °C. On centrifugation (700 g, 20 s), the beads were washed twice in 12 mL of washing buffer A. Another washing step followed with the addition of 12 mL of washing buffer B (washing buffer A without TritonX‐100). Samples were centrifuged again for 20 s at 700 g, and the supernatant was replaced by 30 μL of NuPAGE® LDS Sample Buffer (4×; Invitrogen GmbH, Karlsruhe, Germany), together with 30 μL of 100 mm dithiothreitol (DTT). Incubation at 50 °C for 15 min reduced the disulphide bonds. Centrifugation (900 g, 30 s) of the samples on MicroSpin™ columns (GE Healthcare, Little Chalfont, Buckinghamshire, UK) allowed the separation of the beads and precipitated proteins. For alkylation, 1:10 2‐iodoacetamide (1 m) was added, and the samples were incubated for 30 min in the dark at room temperature.  Nanoflow LC‐MS/MS of tryptic peptides was performed on an amaZon ETD mass spectrometer (Bruker Daltronik, Bremen, Germany) coupled to an easy‐nLC (Proxeon, Odense, Denmark). Peptides were separated on a self‐packed 0.075 × 20‐cm2 reversed‐phase column (Reposil, Dr. Maisch, Ammerbuch, Germany) using a 110‐min gradient from 10% to 35% of buffer B (0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile) at a flow rate of 300 nL/min. Intact masses of eluting peptides were determined in enhanced scan mode, and the five most intense peaks were selected for further fragmentation by collision‐induced dissociation (CID) and acquisition of fragment spectra in ultra‐scan mode. Singly charged precursor ions, as well as ions with unknown charge state, were rejected. Dynamic exclusion was enabled and the dynamic exclusion duration was set to 10 s. Peaklist files were generated with DataAnalysis 4.0 (Bruker Daltonik, Bremen, Germany), and database searches were performed using the Mascot search engine version 2.3.01 (Matrix Science, London, UK) with a tolerance of 0.3 Da for peptide and 0.6 Da for fragment ions against the NCBI (http://.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) database (nr_20070216, 4 626 804 entries) and the viridiplantae subset of the NCBI database (339 709 entries), considering carbamidomethylation of cysteine residues (+57.01 Da) as a fixed modification and oxidation of methionine (+15.99 Da) and pyro‐glutamic acid from Q or E (–18.01 Da) as variable modifications. The Mascot search result files were analysed using Scaffold version 2.6.2 (Proteome Software Inc., Portland, OR, USA). Threshold parameters were set as follows: protein probability, 80%; minimum number of peptides, 1; peptide probability, 80%. These parameters yielded a false‐discovery rate of 8.8% at the protein level and 7.0% at the peptide–spectrum match level. Protein identifications of candidate proteins were further validated by manual inspection of the tandem mass spectra.  To analyse the number of E. cruciferarum produced conidiophores per colony, leaves were discoloured and stained with acetic ink, as described previously for the staining of epiphytic structures of B. graminis f.sp. hordei (Hückelhoven and Kogel, CITATION).  The measurement of the glucosinolate content of wild‐type Col‐0 and cyp83a1 mutants was performed via HPLC/diode array detection (DAD) analysis according to Mikkelsen et al. (CITATION).  For cell death induction, 10 μL of 100 μm AAL toxin (A8331, Sigma‐Aldrich Chemie GmbH) solution were dropped on leaves of 5‐week‐old Arabidopsis plants. Distilled water served as a control. For heat stress experiments, 8‐day‐old seedlings, grown on half‐strength Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium, were incubated at 35 °C for 3 h, followed by a 3‐day recovery phase and an additional heat stress at 45 °C for 2 h.  For acceptor photobleaching FRET experiments, protein‐coding sequences were cloned into the overexpression vector pGY‐1 (Schweizer et al., CITATION). To obtain pGY‐1‐BI‐1‐GFP, BI‐1‐GFP was amplified using gDNA of BI‐1‐GFP‐expressing mutants (Kawai‐Yamada et al., CITATION) as template, and cloned directly into pGY‐1. pGY‐1‐mGFP5‐ER was obtained by subcloning mGFP5‐ER from pBIN‐mGFP5‐ER (Haseloff et al., CITATION; Siemering et al., CITATION) into pGY‐1. The genomic sequence of CYP83A1 (At4g13770), lacking the stop codon, was isolated by PCR and cloned in frame with mCherry into pGY‐1, resulting in pGY‐1‐CYP83A1‐mCherry. The primers used are listed in Table S4 (see Supporting Information).  For co‐localization studies in tobacco, the respective protein‐coding sequences were cloned into the modified binary vector pBI101+ (lacking the β‐glucuronidase (GUS) coding sequence; Pröls and Roitsch, CITATION). The PHB2 (At1g03860) coding sequence was isolated by PCR and cloned in frame with RFP (AAS78495) into pGY‐1, resulting in pGY‐1‐PHB2‐RFP. The open reading frame of RPN2 (At4g21150) was isolated by PCR and cloned in frame with mCherry into pGY‐1, resulting in pGY‐1‐RPN2‐mCherry. RFP, PHB2‐RFP, BI‐1‐GFP, GFP, CYP83A1‐mCherry and RPN2‐mCherry expression cassettes were subcloned from pGY‐1 into the internal HindIII site of modified pBI101+. All primers used are listed in Table S5 (see Supporting Information).  Leaf segments of about 5‐week‐old tobacco plants were co‐transformed with pBI101+‐BI‐1‐GFP and pBI101+‐RFP or pBI101+‐PHB2‐RFP, or were co‐transformed with pBI101+‐BI‐1‐GFP or pBI101+‐GFP, together with pBI101+‐CYP83A1‐mCherry or pBI101+‐1‐RPN2‐mCherry, by agroinfiltration, as described by Yang et al. (CITATION).  Transformed leaf segments were analysed by confocal laser‐scanning microscopy using the sequential scanning mode in order to avoid channel cross‐talk. BI‐1‐GFP and GFP were excited by a 488‐nm laser line and detected at 505–530 nm. RFP, PHB2‐RFP, CYP83A1‐mCherry and RPN2‐mCherry were excited by a 561‐nm laser line and detected at 580–650 nm.  Arabidopsis epidermal cells were ballistically transformed with 1 μg per shot of pGY‐1‐BI‐1‐GFP or pGY‐1‐mGFP5‐ER, together with 2 μg per shot of pGY‐1‐CYP83A1‐mCherry, using a particle inflow gun, as described by Finer et al. (CITATION). To decrease ER movement, 24 h after bombardment, transformed leaves were fixed in 4% formaldehyde, as described previously by Opalski et al. (CITATION). Acceptor photobleaching FRET analysis was performed directly after fixation using the Leica Application Suite, Advanced Fluorescence 1.8.0 software (Leica Microsystems, Wetzlar, Germany). After imaging a cell co‐expressing BI‐1‐GFP or mGFP5‐ER, together with CYP83A1‐mCherry, a defined region of interest at the nuclear envelope was bleached by five times scanning with the 561‐nm laser line at 100% relative laser intensity (20% of 20‐mW laser power at 561 nm). The cell was imaged again using the same settings as before bleaching. FRET efficiency in the bleached area was calculated from the donor fluorescence intensities before (Dpost) and after (Dpre) bleaching as follows: FRETeff = (Dpost − Dpre)/Dpost. GFP was excited by a 488‐nm laser line and detected at 505–530 nm. mCherry was excited by a 561‐nm laser line and detected in the spectral range 580–650 nm.
