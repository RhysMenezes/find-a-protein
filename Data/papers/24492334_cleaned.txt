!~ABS~! The water and nutrient status of pollen is crucial to plant reproduction. Pollen grains of Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) contain a large vegetative cell and two smaller sperm cells. Pollen grains express AtTIP1;3 and AtTIP5;1, two members of the Tonoplast Intrinsic Protein subfamily of aquaporins. To address the spatial and temporal expression pattern of the two homologs, C-terminal fusions of AtTIP1;3 and AtTIP5;1 with green fluorescent protein and mCherry, respectively, were expressed in transgenic Arabidopsis under the control of their native promoter. Confocal laser scanning microscopy revealed that AtTIP1;3 and AtTIP5;1 are specific for the vacuoles of the vegetative and sperm cells, respectively. The tonoplast localization of AtTIP5;1 was established by reference to fluorescent protein markers for the mitochondria and vacuoles of sperm and vegetative cells and is at variance with the claim that AtTIP5;1 is localized in vegetative cell mitochondria. AtTIP1;3-green fluorescent protein and AtTIP5;1-mCherry showed concomitant expression, from first pollen mitosis up to pollen tube penetration in the ovule, thereby revealing the dynamics of vacuole morphology in maturating and germinating pollen. Transfer DNA insertion mutants for either AtTIP1;3 or AtTIP5;1 showed no apparent growth phenotype and had no significant defect in male transmission of the mutated alleles. By contrast, a double knockout displayed an abnormal rate of barren siliques, this phenotype being more pronounced under limited water or nutrient supply. The overall data indicate that vacuoles of vegetative and sperm cells functionally interact and contribute to male fertility in adverse environmental conditions.
!~RES~! Neutral red was used to visualize the vacuolar equipment of mature and germinating Arabidopsis pollen. Under light transmission, a multitude of vacuoles of 0.5 to 4 µm in diameter was revealed throughout the whole vegetative cell (Fig. 1A). During pollen germination, a bigger vacuole became visible, distal to the PT emergence side, while smaller vacuoles were present proximal to the emergence side (Fig. 1B). To possibly get a better resolution, we also used confocal laser scanning microscopy. The z-stack projection of a series of optical sections obtained in the vegetative cell showed a pattern and amount of stained structures similar to those observed under transmission light (Fig. 1C; Supplemental Movie S1). Small spherical vesicles were also fluorescently labeled in the sperm cells of mature pollen (Fig. 1C). These vesicles probably represent the sperm vacuoles. [[FIGURE]] C-terminal fusions of AtTIP1;3 and AtTIP5;1 with GFP and mCherry, respectively, were placed under the control of their native promoter and introduced into transgenic Arabidopsis, and their expression was imaged in pollen. The DNA dye 4′,6′-diamino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) was used to define the different developmental stages. In accordance with transcriptomic data (CITATION), no or low expression of AtTIP1;3-GFP was observed in tetrads or released microspores (Fig. 2, A and B). Expression became visible after first pollen mitosis, exclusively in the vegetative cell of bicellular pollen grains, and with early expression in a perinuclear ring (Fig. 2C). Soon afterward, AtTIP1;3-GFP labeled fuzzy structures and a multitude of small, dispatched vesicles (Fig. 2D), similar to those visualized using neutral red (Fig. 1A). A mitochondria-targeted red fluorescent protein (RFP) under the control of a vegetative cell-specific Late Anther Tomato52 (LAT52) promoter (VC-mtRFP; CITATION) did not show any colocalization with AtTIP1;3-GFP (Fig. 3A). By contrast, the fuzzy structures were partially costained with ER-Tracker Blue-White DPX (Supplemental Fig. S1). Thus, these structures probably correspond to multiple compartments of the secretory system. Because their labeling by AtTIP1;3-GFP diminished over the course of pollen maturation and was almost totally lacking in germinating pollen grains (Fig. 2E), this localization may reflect the anterograde trafficking of AtTIP1;3-GFP to the vacuole. The AtTIP1;3-GFP fusion also intensely labeled the vegetative cell during pollen germination and PT emergence, revealing the high degree of vacuolation associated with these processes (Fig. 2, E and G). Tubular vacuoles (CITATION) and bulb-like structures (CITATION) were also strongly highlighted by the fusion protein in the PT (Fig. 2, F and H). [[FIGURE]] [[FIGURE]] The expression of AtTIP5;1-mCherry appeared at the binuclear pollen state, simultaneously to that of AtTIP1;3-GFP (Fig. 4). By contrast, AtTIP5;1-mCherry showed expression exclusively in the sperm cells. Expression first appeared as a perinuclear ring surrounding the generative nucleus (Fig. 4, A–C). The protein then accumulated in the membrane of minute spherical structures (Fig. 4, D–F). An observation of sperm cells released from mature pollen grains confirmed the sperm-specific expression of AtTIP5;1-mCherry (Fig. 4G; Supplemental Fig. S2A). Each of the sperm cells examined (n > 40) disposed of one to six of these structures that typically ranged between 0.1 and 1 µm in size (Fig. 4E). Because these structures were comparable to those seen with neutral red (Fig. 1C) but could also correspond to mitochondria, we assessed their nature using coexpression of AtTIP5;1-mCherry with well-identified subcellular markers (Fig. 3, B and C). SC-mtGFP, a mitochondria-targeted GFP fusion protein under the control of the sperm cell-specific Duo Pollen1 (DUO1) promoter (CITATION), revealed intensely stained oblong structures of approximately 0.5 µm in length (10–22 per cell; n = 11 cells). Thorough observations in dry (n = 17) and hydrated (n = 17) pollen did not indicate, however, any colocalization of SC-mtGFP with AtTIP5;1-mCherry (Fig. 3B; Supplemental Movie S2). VHA-E1, one of three E soluble subunits of the vacuolar H+-ATPase, is highly abundant in sperm cells (CITATION). Upon coexpression, colocalization, in both spherical and fuzzy structures, was observed between AtTIP5;1-mCherry and VHA-E1-GFP (Fig. 3C), which could be confirmed in three-dimensional image reconstructions (Supplemental Movie S3) and in released sperm cells (Supplemental Fig. S2). A colocalization in sperm cells of AtTIP5;1-mCherry with another soluble subunit of the vacuolar H+-ATPase (VHA-E3-GFP), which localizes to both vegetative and sperm vacuoles (CITATION), confirmed this finding (Supplemental Fig. S3). Our overall data indicate that AtTIP5;1-mCherry was localized to organelles of the secretory pathway, including vacuoles, but not to the mitochondria of sperm cells. This pattern of labeling was sustained during pollen germination when the sperm cell migrated into the PT (Fig. 4, E and F). It could be followed up to the micropyle penetration of the PT into the embryo sac (Supplemental Fig. S4). [[FIGURE]] Because an earlier study proposed that AtTIP5;1 localizes to the mitochondria of the vegetative cell (CITATION), we wondered whether this protein may not show distinct subcellular localization depending on its cell expression context. We therefore generated the construct (LAT52::GFP-TIP5;1) previously used for ectopic expression of GFP-TIP5;1 in the vegetative cell and analyzed its coexpression with the VC-mtRFP mitochondrial marker (Supplemental Fig. S5). The TIP5;1 fusion protein showed a fuzzy expression across the whole vegetative cell, with a more pronounced accumulation in the plasma membrane and small punctuate structures (Supplemental Fig. S5, A and D). Yet, no colocalization with the mitochondrial marker was observed in any of these locations (Supplemental Fig. S5, C and F). To further establish the expression specificity of AtTIP1;3-GFP and AtTIP5;1-mCherry, we analyzed the pollen of plants coexpressing the two fusion proteins (Fig. 3D). While expression of AtTIP1;3-GFP was exclusively found throughout the vegetative cell, expression of AtTIP5;1-mCherry was restricted to the sperm cell. The overall data establish the expression specificity of AtTIP1;3 and AtTIP5;1 in the vacuoles of the vegetative and sperm cells, respectively. Transgenic Arabidopsis lines carrying a T-DNA insertion in the promoter of AtTIP1;3 (SALK_088276) and in the second intron of AtTIP5;1 (GABI_171E08; Fig. 5A) were used to produce homozygous knockout lines hereafter referred to as tip1;3-1 and tip5;1-1 (Fig. 5B) and lacking any transcript for AtTIP1;3 and AtTIP5;1, respectively (Fig. 5C). tip5;1-1 represents a knockout allele different from that described by CITATION. [[FIGURE]] Neither tip1;3-1 nor tip5;1-1 showed any macroscopic shoot growth phenotype (data not shown), in accordance with the quasiexclusive expression of these TIPs in generative pollen tissues. Although the loss of AtTIP1;3 or AtTIP5;1 might cause a defect in pollen maturation or pollen vacuole functions, there was no major reduction in fertility in the mutant plants (not shown). To investigate slight alterations in male transmission of the mutated allele, we carried out crosses in which pollen from heterozygous +/tip1;3-1 or +/tip5;1-1 plants were manually deposited on pistils from sister wild-type plants. Such crosses create a competition for male transmission between the mutated and the wild-type alleles. A reciprocal cross in which pollen from the same wild-type plant was deposited on stigma of the respective +/tip1;3-1 or +/tip5;1-1 plant was performed as a control (Table I). Transmission of the mutated allele in the offspring seeds was screened using PCR (tip3;1-1) or T-DNA-encoded antibiotic resistance (tip5;1-1). Pollen from heterozygous mutant plants (+/tip1;3-1 or +/tip5;1-1) was crossed onto stigma of wild-type (+/+) plants. In a control assay, the reciprocal crosses were accomplished on the same plants. Crosses were performed in six to seven plant pairs, with at least six individual flowers per plant, yielding more than 200 seeds for each cross. The table shows the number of wild-type and heterozygous plants and the percentage of heterozygous plants in the corresponding progenies. A χ2 test was applied comparing the transmission of the mutated allele to the theoretically expected percentage of transmission (50%) and, in the case of a heterozygous male, to the percentage of transmission observed in the reciprocal cross. χ2 values are in all cases below the given threshold value of 3.84 (P = 0.05 for a difference). The plants used for the crossings were sister lines obtained in the progeny of self-crossed heterozygous mutant plants. Dashes indicate that data are not available. Control crosses (with wild-type pollen) yielded 47.1% and 48.2% of +/tip1;3-1 and +/tip5;1-1 seeds (Table I). These values are slightly below but not significantly different (χ2 test) from the theoretically expected value (50%). In the reciprocal crosses (with heterozygous mutant pollen), the transmission efficiency of the tip1;3-1 and tip5;1-1 mutant alleles was 50% and 48.8%, respectively (Table I). These percentages were not significantly different from the respective control crosses or from the theoretically expected percentage (50%). Thus, there was no significant defect in male transmission of either one of the tip1;3-1 or tip5;1-1 alleles, in agreement with the work by CITATION. A homozygous double knockout line, tip1;3-1/tip5;1-1, that lacks both AtTIP1;3 and AtTIP5;1 was prepared (Fig. 5B) and characterized for pollen function and reproduction. Vitality assay with Alexander’s stain (CITATION) did not reveal any abnormalities when comparing tip1;3-1/tip5;1-1 with wild-type pollen (Supplemental Fig. S6). Wild-type and tip1;3-1/tip5;1-1 plants grown in soil at 20°C under regular irrigation had similar silique number. We noticed, however, that 7.5% ± 0.9% (n = 24 plants) and 27.4% ± 2.7% (n = 33 plants) of their siliques were shorter than fully developed siliques and mostly devoid of seeds (Fig. 5D; Supplemental Fig. S7). These siliques contained instead numerous nonfertilized ovules (Supplemental Fig. S7). With respect to wild-type plants, the proportion of barren siliques was significantly higher (P < 0.01) in tip1;3-1/tip5;1-1 but not in tip1;3-1 and tip5;1-1 plants (Fig. 5D). When grown in hydroponic, nutrient-replete conditions, wild-type and double knockout plants had virtually no barren siliques (<0.5%) and comparable mean silique numbers (wild type: number of siliques = 682 ± 31, n = nine plants; tip1;3-1/tip5;1-1: number of siliques = 709 ± 36, n = 10 plants). When grown in hydroponic conditions, but under nitrate deprivation, plants showed a dramatically reduced number of siliques, with more pronounced effects in tip1;3-1/tip5;1-1 (number of siliques = 25 ± 2, n = 10 plants) than in wild-type plants (number of siliques = 62 ± 5, n = 10 plants). When plants were grown in soil but subjected to a severe heat treatment (32°C), the number of siliques was reduced by 2-fold in the wild type (20°C, 596 ± 48; 32°C, 328 ± 34) and approximately 22-fold in tip1;3-1/tip5;1-1 (20°C, 534 ± 62; 32°C, 24 ± 2). Altogether, the data point to a defect of tip1;3-1/tip5;1-1 plants to achieve proper seed development and silique growth, that is, a true reproduction phenotype. This phenotype was the most pronounced under environmental stress conditions.
!~MM~! All plants used in this work were Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) accession Columbia-0. The complementary DNAs (cDNAs) of enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) and mCherry were PCR amplified with primers XFPfwd/XFPrev (Supplemental Table S1), allowing for the addition of a short partial Ser/Gly4-linker sequence at their 5′ extremity. The resulting fragments were cloned into the XhoI/XbaI sites of a pBluescript SK(+)-based vector (Stratagene) containing the EcoRI/ClaI pKYLX71 expression cassette (CITATION). Plant genomic DNA (gDNA) was used as a template for PCR amplification of AtTIP1;3 (At4g01470) and AtTIP5;1 (At3g47440), using the primer pairs 1;3fwd1/1;3rev and 5;1fwd1/5;1rev, respectively (Supplemental Table S1). Fragments comprising the open reading frames of interest and approximately 1.5 kb of the corresponding promoter region upstream the initiating ATG were thus amplified with the addition of a short partial Gly4/Ser-linker sequence at the 3′ end (Supplemental Table S1). The amplicon was then cloned into the EcoRI/XhoI sites of the modified pBluescript SK. This resulted in an in-frame fusion of AtTIP1;3 or AtTIP5;1 with a Gly4/Ser2/Gly4-linker and EGFP (AtTIP1;3) or mCherry (AtTIP5;1). The two chimaeras were followed by a ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase small subunit terminator cloned within XbaI/ClaI sites. The whole cassette was subsequently cloned into the EcoRI/ClaI sites of a pGreen-0029 (AtTIP1;3) or a pGreenII-0179 (AtTIP5;1) vector. The LAT52::GFP-AtTIP5;1 construct was made using Gateway cloning technology (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The cDNA of AtTIP5;1 was PCR amplified with primers allowing the addition of attB recombination sites and cloned into a pDONR 207 vector using a Gateway BP Clonase enzyme mix. The cDNA was then transferred into the binary destination vectors pK7WGF[LAT52::GFP] (gift from Dr. José A. Feijó) by using a Gateway LR Clonase enzyme mix. The pK7WGF[LAT52::GFP] vector allows fusion of GFP with the aquaporin N terminus (GFP-AtTIP5;1), and expression of the resulting cDNA is placed under the control of a LAT52 promoter and of the 35S Cauliflower mosaic virus terminator. All plasmid constructs were checked by DNA sequencing (GATC Biotech AG) and transformed into Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain GV3101 to allow transformation of Arabidopsis ecotype Columbia-0 by the floral-dip method (CITATION). Transformants were screened on one-half-strength Murashige and Skoog (MS/2) medium (CITATION) containing either 50 mg L–1 kanamycin (AtTIP1;3::AtTIP1;3-GFP; LAT52::GFP-AtTIP5;1) or 40 mg L–1 hygromycin (AtTIP5;1::AtTIP5;1-mCherry). Plants expressing fluorescent reporter proteins specific for mitochondria of the pollen vegetative cell (VC-mtRFP) or sperm cells (SC-mtGFP) were as described (CITATION). Expression of VHA-E1-GFP and of VHA-E3-GFP was monitored using transgenic plants described by CITATION. Reciprocal crosses were accomplished with plants cultured in soil (Neuhaus Humin Substrat N2, Klasman-Deilmann) in a controlled growth chamber at 20°C with regular irrigation and a relative humidity of 70% and under an 8-h-light (180 µE m–2 s–1)/16-h-dark cycle. Antibiotic resistance of the tip5;1-1 × wild-type offspring was screened on MS/2 medium (CITATION) containing sulfadiazine (5 mg L–1). Silique formation in wild-type and tip1;3 and tip5;1 mutant genotypes was monitored in plants grown in soil as described above. Hydroponic cultures were carried out as described earlier (CITATION). In brief, cultures were maintained at 70% relative humidity with a 16-h light (250 µmol photons m–2 s–1) at 22°C/8-h dark at 21°C cycle in a culture medium containing 1.25 mm KNO3, 0.75 mm MgSO4, 1.5 mm Ca(NO3)2, 0.5 mm KH2PO4, 50 µm FeEDTA, 50 µm H3BO3, 12 µm MnSO4, 0.70 µm CuSO4, 1 µm ZnSO4, 0.24 µm MoO4Na2, and 100 µm Na2SiO3. In nitrate deprivation experiments, 15-d-old plants where transferred in a same solution but with 1.25 mm KNO3 and 1.5 mm Ca(NO3)2 substituted by 1.25 mm KSO4, 1.5 mm CaSO4, and 0.05 mm Ca(NO3)2. For heat treatments, 15-d-old soil-grown plants were transferred from growth at 20°C to growth at 32°C under the same relative humidity and light conditions as above. Extraction of gDNA was accomplished using a simplified cetyltrimethylammonium bromide method as described in CITATION but without performing the second precipitation step. In brief, the collected plant material was ground with the help of a bead blender after liquid nitrogen freezing. Each sample was then incubated in 500 μL of extraction buffer (1.4 m NaCl, 20 mm EDTA, 2% [w/v] cetyltrimethylammonium bromide, 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and 0.4% [v/v] β-mercaptoethanol added extemporaneously). After 30 min at 65°C, each sample was chloroform extracted, and DNA was precipitated once with isopropanol and finally washed with 70% ethanol, dried, and dissolved in 50 μL water. Three to five microliters of DNA were used for each PCR reaction. The Arabidopsis T-DNA insertion lines SALK_088276 (AtTIP1;3) and GABI_171E08 (AtTIP5;1) were obtained from the Nottingham Arabidopsis Stock Center. The T-DNA insertions in these lines were confirmed by PCR on gDNA using a combination of primers specific for the T-DNA left border and genomic sequence of AtTIP1;3 (LBb1/1;3fwd1, Supplemental Table S1) and AtTIP5;1 (o8409/5;1rev, Supplemental Table S1), respectively. The neomycine phosphotransferaseII (NPTII) selectable marker of the SALK_088276 line was probably silenced, because no kanamycin resistance was observed in this line. Homozygous mutant lines were identified from SALK_088276 and GABI_171E08, and named tip1;3-1 and tip5;1-1, respectively. The genotype of these lines was established by PCR on gDNA. A tip1;3-1/tip5;1-1 double knockout line was obtained by crossing the two homozygous single knockout lines, and the offspring was amplified. A homozygous double knockout line was identified within the F3 generation and confirmed by PCR on gDNA using the primer pairs described above. The absence of full-length transcript in tip1;3-1 and tip5;1-1 was checked by reverse transcription-PCR using pairs of AtTIP1;3- and AtTIP5;1-specific primers (1;3fwd2/1;3rev and 5;1fwd2/5;1rev, respectively). The cDNA matrix was obtained from RNAs isolated from inflorescences using a spin or vacuum total RNA isolation system (Promega) and after reverse transcription with a M-MLV Reverse Transcriptase (Promega), according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Expression of the Elongation Factor1α (EF1α) gene was used as a control as described (CITATION). For temporal expression analyses, flower buds were dissected at different developmental stages, and pollen grains were mounted on slides in a liquid MS/2 medium. The DNA dye DAPI was added directly to the mounting media at a final concentration of 2 µg mL–1. Pollen vacuoles were stained with 0.01% (w/v) neutral red for up to 2 h. ER-Tracker Blue-White DPX (Molecular Probes) was applied to the mounting media at a final concentration of 10 µm. Pollen vitality staining was accomplished by incubating pollen for 15 min in the dark in a 1:25 dilution of a stock solution of Alexander’s stain (CITATION) containing 10% (v/v) ethanol, 0.05% (w/v) fuchsin acid, 0.005% (w/v) Orange G, 0.05% (v/v) malachite green, 2% (v/v) acetic acid, and 25% (v/v) glycerol. Microscopic observations were carried out as described (CITATION) using an Olympus BX610 microscope equipped with an epifluorescence condenser or using a confocal laser scanning microscope (Zeiss LSM510 AX70, Olympus Fluoview FV10i-W). Sequence data from this article can be found in the GenBank/EMBL data libraries under accession numbers: AtTIP1;3, At4g01470; and AtTIP5;1, At3g47440.
