!~ABS~! Insertion mutations that disrupt the function of PHT4;6 (At5g44370) cause NaCl hypersensitivity of Arabidopsis seedlings that is characterized by reduced growth of the primary root, enhanced lateral branching, and swelling of root tips. Mutant phenotypes were exacerbated by sucrose, but not by equiosmolar concentrations of mannitol, and attenuated by low inorganic phosphate in the medium. Protein PHT4;6 belongs to the Major Facilitator Superfamily of permeases that shares significant sequence similarity to mammalian type-I Pi transporters and vesicular glutamate transporters, and is a member of the PHT4 family of putative intracellular phosphate transporters of plants. PHT4;6 localizes to the Golgi membrane and transport studies indicate that PHT4;6 facilitates the selective transport of Pi but not of chloride or inorganic anions. Phenotypic similarities with other mutants displaying root swelling suggest that PHT4;6 likely functions in protein N -glycosylation and cell wall biosynthesis, which are essential for salt tolerance. Together, our results indicate that PHT4;6 transports Pi out of the Golgi lumenal space for the re-cycling of the Pi released from glycosylation processes.
!~RES~! A population of ∼94 000 T-DNA insertion lines in the Arabidopsis thaliana C24 RD29A::LUC genetic background was screened for NaCl sensitivity based primarily on the analysis of root growth inhibition ( [bib80] ; [bib33] ) and a mutant, later designated pht4;6-1 , was identified. On medium supplemented with 150 mM NaCl, pht4;6-1 seedlings exhibited cessation of primary root growth, swelling of primary root tip and hairs, and development of short and swollen lateral roots ( [fig1 fig2] ). The NaCl-induced root swelling of pht4;6-1 seedlings was due primarily to radial expansion of epidermal and cortical cells in the elongation zone ( [fig2] ). Cells of the stele were morphologically normal except that the meristem at the tip of primary and secondary roots exhibited cessation or reduction in the cell division activity ( [fig2] ). Cell files in the primary root elongation zone of pht4;6-1 seedlings appeared undisturbed by NaCl stress even in tissues peripheral to the meristem where radial expansion occurs ( [fig2] ). Despite the distorted anatomy of cells exhibited by pht4;6-1 in the elongation zone of seedling roots after growth on medium with 150 mM NaCl for 20 d, most roots re-initiated cell division and longitudinal expansion after transfer to medium without salt supplement ( [fig1] ). However, prolonged culture of pht4;6 seedlings on agar medium resulted in slight swelling of the root tip and increased lateral root branching even in the absence of salt stress (see [fig9] ). Regardless of the severity of NaCl stress, neither wild-type nor sos1-14 seedlings exhibited the aberrant root swelling or lateral branching phenotype of pht4;6-1 seedlings ( [fig1] and data not shown). The sos1-14 mutation is a T-DNA insertion in the C24 RD29a::LUC genetic background that renders the plasma membrane Na + /H + antiporter SOS1 dysfunctional ( [bib67] ; [bib33] ). The shoot biomass of pht4;6-1 seedlings on medium with NaCl was similar to wild-type. In standard in-vitro growth conditions, pht4;6-1 seedlings exhibited slightly more vigorous shoot and root growth than wild-type seedlings and an increase in lateral branching, but without root tip swelling ( [fig1 fig9] ). Caulinar leaves of greenhouse-grown pht4;6-1 plants expanded more slowly (1.01 ± 0.07 and 0.71 ± 0.06 g fresh weight/leaf for 50-day-old wild-type and pht4;6-1 plants, respectively, n = 8). It is worth noting that growth of pht4;6-1 mutant seedlings in liquid medium caused moderate root swelling symptoms that were alleviated by increasing the density of the medium with the addition of low (0.15%) agar concentrations (data not shown). Unlike the rsw mutants, root swelling did not occur at high temperature in pht4;6 seedlings (data not show). The T-DNA insertion in pht4;6-1 plants is located 680 bp upstream of the translational start of locus At5g44370 (nucleotide position 51153 of TAC clone K9L2) ( [fig3] ), which has been previously named ANTR5 ( [bib57] ) and PHT4;6 ( [bib23] ). Full-length PHT4;6 transcript was not detected by RT–PCR analysis in pht4;6-1 seedlings, indicating that the allele is dysfunctional ( [fig3] ). T 3 plants homozygous for pht4;6-1 were backcrossed to wild-type ( pht4;6-1 x C24) and F 1 progeny ( n = 14) exhibited wild-type growth on medium with 150 mM NaCl ( [fig3] ). F 2 analysis ( n > 900, four independent lines) established a segregation ratio of 3:1 for NaCl tolerance:sensitivity (X 2 test, P > 0.05), indicating that pht4;6-1 is a monogenic recessive mutation. PCR analysis of NaCl-sensitive F 2 plants established that all ( n = 82) were homozygous for the pht4;6-1 allele at the PHT4;6 locus, indicating that the T-DNA insertion is linked tightly (<1 cM) ( [bib78] ) to the NaCl-sensitive phenotype displayed by pht4;6-1 seedlings. An in-silico analysis of the Arabidopsis T-DNA ‘G.A.R.L.I.C’ population (Torrey Mesa Research Institute, San Diego, CA, www.nadii.com/pages/collaborations/garlic_files/GarlicDescription.html ) identified line 809 (ecotype Col-0), which has a T-DNA insertion that is located 449 bp downstream of the initiation codon in PHT4;6 , and that is denoted here as allele pht4;6-2 ( [fig3] ). A minority (ca. ¼) of T 2 progeny of line 809 segregated for salt sensitivity on medium supplemented with 150 mM NaCl. These salt-sensitive seedlings exhibited a similar phenotype to that of pht4;6-1 seedlings ( [fig3] ). All of the NaCl-sensitive seedlings in the T 2 population were homozygous for the pht4;6-2 allele, and PHT4;6 mRNA was not detected in pht4;6-2 seedlings ( [fig3] ). All F 1 progeny of pht4;6-1 x pht4;6-2 ( n = 1) or pht4;6-2 x pht4;6-1 ( n = 25) exhibited similar NaCl sensitivity as pht4;6-1 or pht4;6-2 seedlings ( [fig3] ). Genotypic analysis confirmed the presence of both pht4;6-1 and pht4;6-2 alleles in all F 1 hybrids and PHT4;6 mRNA was not detected in any of the F 1 progeny ( [fig3] ). These results indicate that pht4;6-1 and pht4;6-2 are allelic and that both mutations cause dysfunctional alleles that result in NaCl sensitivity. The At5g44370 ( PHT4;6 ) gene encodes a putative 432 amino acid peptide that, based on primary and secondary structure, is predicted to be a member of the Major Facilitator Superfamily (MFS) of permeases. MFS is a large and diverse family of single-polypeptide carriers transporting low-molecular-mass solutes across various cell membranes that are capable of mediating either influx or efflux of solutes using uniport, symport, or antiport mechanisms ( [bib48] ). Computational analyses (TMHMM program; www.cbs.dtu.dk ) indicates that PHT4;6 contains 12 TM regions arranged in two groups of six-TM units separated by a cytosolic loop between residues 188 and 224 (data not shown). The protein encoded by locus At5g44370 (PHT4;6) was initially annotated to be a putative anion/cation co-transporter based on its sequence homology (30–31% identity, using the ClustalX program) to mammalian brain-specific and differentiation-associated Na + -dependent inorganic phosphate co-transporters BNPI and DNPI, respectively ( [sec1] ). Subsequently, however, these vertebrate proteins have been shown to function as vesicular glutamate transporters and are now termed VGLUT1 and VGLUT2, respectively ( [bib6] ; [bib71] ; [bib27] ; [bib72] ). These proteins, and the homolog VGLUT3 ( [bib70] ), are localized to synaptic vesicles of glutamatergic neurons where they mediate the loading of the neurotransmitter glutamate into vesicles by H + gradient-dependent uptake. The homologous protein NaPi-1 from rabbit kidney cells was the first characterized Na–Pi co-transporter from vertebrates, but further studies have shown that NaPi-1 is permeant to chloride and organic anions in Xenopus oocytes ( [bib10] ). Besides the homology to the vesicular organic anion transporter subfamily of vertebrate MFS, PHT4;6 has 30% identity to sialin, a lysosomal transporter involved in the efflux of free monocarboxylated monosaccharides released from recycled glycoproteins and glycolipids. In turn, sialin clusters together with VGLUT proteins and other vesicular organic anion transporters on the phylogenetic tree ( [sec1] ). The capacity for sialic acid biosynthesis is thought not to exist in plants, but sialylation of glycoconjugates has been described recently for plant cell cultures, including those of Arabidopsis thaliana ( [bib66] ). In spite of its similarity to sialin, PHT4;6 shares very weak homology (11–12% identity) to well characterized MFS sugar transporters of Arabidopsis , like the plasma membrane monosaccharyde-proton symporter STP1 and the Golgi GDP-mannose transporter GONST1, or with the sialate transporter of E. coli NanT (16% identity) ( [sec1] ). Recently, PHT4;6 has been characterized within a six-gene family referred to as PHT4 based on their proposed role in intracellular transport of inorganic phosphate (Pi) ( [bib23] ). All of the PHT4 proteins mediate Pi uptake in whole cells of yeast with high specificity. Sequence homologies among PHT4 proteins are 25–70%, as determined by the alignment program ClustalX 1.83 ( [sec1] ). PHT4;1, PHT4;2, PHT4;4, and PHT;5 are localized to the chloroplast ( [bib57] ; [bib23] ). PHT4;6 co-localized with a Golgi marker and the localization of PHT4;3 remains unresolved ( [bib23] ). All six PHT4 proteins cluster together in the phylogenetic tree to a clade that contains the vertebrate proteins VGLUT and sialin. Notably, however, PHT4;6 shares only 25–35% identity with other PHT4 proteins, which is not significantly greater than its homology to VGLUTs (30–31%) and sialin (30%), despite the evolutionary distance between plants and vertebrates. Considering the homology between PHT4;6 and other transporters that are permeant to sodium, phosphate, chloride, and organic anions (VGLUT/NaPi-1 family), or sugars (sialin), the pht4;6-1 mutant was subjected to a more detailed characterization of ionic, osmotic, and sugar sensitivity. Root elongation was used as an indicator of the response of pht4;6-1 to various salt and sugar treatments. Mutant pht4;6-1 was hypersensitive to NaCl and KCl stress, as shown by root growth inhibition and swelling in the root elongation area, but not to LiCl ( [fig4] ). In contrast, pht4;6-1 seedlings were only moderately sensitive to equimolar concentrations of Na + and K + supplied as sulfate salts (Na 2 SO 4 and K 2 SO 4 ) ( [fig4] ), which could indicate a moderate sensitivity of pht4;6-1 to Cl – . However, there was no significant difference in ion contents between wild-type and pht4;6-1 plants either with or without NaCl treatment when the accumulation of Na + , K + , and Cl – was compared ( [sec1] ). The faster growth of pht4;6-1 seedlings in LiCl compared to wild-type likely resulted form their more vigorous growth in plates in the absence of stress ( [fig1] ). Together, these data suggested the lack of ionic sensitivity. To determine whether pht4;6 plants are hypersensitive to general osmotic stress, root elongation in response to different concentrations of mannitol and sucrose was measured ( [fig4 fig5] ). Seedlings of genotype pht4;6-1 were not hypersensitive to osmotic stress caused by mannitol, but were hypersensitive to equiosmolar concentrations of sucrose. Figure 5 Sucrose Sensitivity of pht4;6 Mutants Is Not Caused by Osmotic Stress. Four-day-old wild-type (Col-0) and pht4;6-2 seedlings were transferred to 1/5 MS medium supplemented with 100 or 300 mM sucrose as indicated and incubated for seven additional days. Sucrose Sensitivity of pht4;6 Mutants Is Not Caused by Osmotic Stress. Four-day-old wild-type (Col-0) and pht4;6-2 seedlings were transferred to 1/5 MS medium supplemented with 100 or 300 mM sucrose as indicated and incubated for seven additional days. The fact that PHT4;6 is permeant to inorganic phosphate (see below) led us to test whether the pht4;6-1 phenotype was due to impaired Pi homeostasis. A root elongation assay was performed on Pi-free MS medium supplemented with 1.25 or 2.5 mM K 2 PO 4 , and with or without 50 mM NaCl. Seeds were germinated first on MS agar medium, and 4-day-old seedlings were then transferred to various media. Seven days after being transferred, both wild-type and pht4;6-1 seedlings had little new root growth in Pi-free medium but pht4;6-1 seedlings did not show a significant increase in lateral root development or in root tip swelling, both in NaCl-free and NaCl-containing media ( [fig6] ). However, salt-induced (50 mM NaCl) primary root growth inhibition, lateral root development, and root swelling of pht4;6-1 seedlings are more evident on Pi-supplemented medium and greatly suppressed in low Pi ( [fig6] ). The sub-cellular localization of PHT4;6 was determined by using a chimaeric protein consisting of PHT4;6 fused at its C-terminus to GFP that was transiently expressed in onion epidermal cells after biolistic transformation or constitutively expressed in Arabidopsis transgenic lines. Transformed onion epidermal cells showed, 36 h after bombardment, a punctate pattern of small and motile fluorescent bodies evenly distributed throughout the cytoplasm in the cell cortex, transvacuolar strands, and perinuclear region ( [fig7] ). An identical fluorescence pattern was observed in transgenic Arabidopsis plants expressing PHT4;6:GFP ( [fig8] ). Fluorescence of PHT4;6:GFP did not co-localize with mitochondria labeled with MitoTracker Red (data not shown). The size (1 μm) and shape of the fluorescent bodies labeled by PHT4;6:GFP were consistent with the organization of Golgi stacks in plant cells ( [bib17] ; [bib54] ; [bib59] ) and identical to that of a GONST1:YFP translational fusion ( [fig7] ). GONST1 is a Golgi-localized GDP-mannose transporter of Arabidopsis ( [bib3] ). To test further the nature of these fluorescent structures, we analyzed their sensitivity to brefeldin A (BFA). BFA disrupts of the anterograde vesicle transport from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi apparatus and its morphologically detectable effects range from the loss of cis -cisternae and a concomitant increase in trans -cisternae to the accumulation of Golgi membranes in highly vesiculated clusters, and, in some cases, the fusion of the Golgi to the endoplasmic reticulum ( [bib60] ; [bib69] ; [bib3] ; [bib54] ). When onion epidermal peels expressing PHT4;6:GFP were incubated in 180 μM BFA for 1–2 h, the fluorescence pattern within the cells changed from numerous small, punctate bodies to a few large aggregated structures, as well as a diffuse fluorescent labeling of the cytoplasm, more evident in the perinuclear region ( [fig7] ). As control, the BFA treatment of onion cells expressing a GONST1:YFP fusion elicited an identical shift in the number and size of fluorescent structures ( [fig7] ). The fluorescence pattern of GONST1:YFP and PHT4;6:GFP was not altered in cells of onion peels incubated for more than 2 h without added BFA (data not shown). To further validate the results obtained by transient expression assays of PHT4;6:GFP in onion epidermal cells, mutant Arabidopsis lines pht4;6-1 and pht4;6-2 , and their parental wild-type lines C24 RD29A::LUC and Col-0, were transformed with plasmid pBIB-PHT4;6:GFP, and three independent transgenic homozygous lines from each transformation were selected for further characterization. Under confocal microscopy, all transgenic lines tested showed the same BFA-sensitive GFP punctate pattern found in transient expression assays, in both young roots and aerial tissues (leaf epidermis and hypocotyl parenchyma; [fig8] ). These results strongly support the localization of PHT4;6 in the Golgi apparatus. Additional proof that the Golgi apparatus is the bona fide sub-cellular localization of the GFP-tagged PHT4;6 and that pht4;6 mutations are responsible for the mutant phenotype, the salt sensitivity of pht4;6 transgenic lines expressing PHT4;6:GFP, was tested in root elongation assays. Constitutive expression of PHT4;6:GFP in the pht4;6-1 and pht4;6-2 genetic backgrounds restored salt tolerance to a level comparable to those of their isogenic wild-type lines ( [fig9] ). These results demonstrate that PHT4;6:GFP complements mutations pht4;6-1 and pht4;6-2 and strongly support the Golgi localization of the PHT4;6 protein. Notably, overexpression of PHT4;6:GFP in a wild-type genetic background caused a slight but consistent growth delay, which is reciprocal to the faster growth of pht4;6 mutants in solid MS plates (data not shown). The phenotypic suppression of mutation pht4;6 in low phosphate and the sequence similarity to chloride transport proteins suggested that PHT4;6 could transport one or both of these inorganic anions. Chloride and phosphate transport was experimentally tested by complementation analysis of yeast mutants. The PHT4;6:GFP chimera localized mainly to the vacuolar membrane of yeast cells, although a few punctuate bodies that may correspond to Golgi stacks were also labeled ( [sec1] ). Strain RGY86 lacks the GEF1/CLC1 voltage-gated chloride channel localized to membranes of the Golgi and prevacuolar compartment ( [bib20] ) and is sensitive to hygromycin and MnCl 2 . The expression of PHT4;6 in strain RGY86 did not complement the gef1 phenotype at any condition tested (data not shown). These results suggest that PHT4;6 is unlikely to permeate chloride. Plasmid PDR195-PHT4;6 was also transformed into the yeast strain PAM2. This strain is deficient in the high-affinity phosphate/proton (PHO84) and phosphate/sodium (PHO89) symport systems, both functioning at the plasma membrane, lacks the periplasmic acid phosphatase PHO3, and is unable to grow in Pi-depleted media ( [bib39] ). Complementation analyses were carried out in Pi-free YNB medium and, in the same medium, supplemented with 0.05 or 7.5 mM sodium phosphate, at pH 4.5, 6.0, and 7.5 (to test Pi–H + co-transport), and with or without 20 mM NaCl (to test for Na–Pi co-transport). The results showed that PHT4;6 failed to complement the PAM2 phenotype in all these conditions. However, lack of complementation could be due to the preferential localization of PHT4;6 to the yeast vacuolar membrane. Therefore, vacuoles of cells expressing PHT4;6 were isolated and transport of radio-labeled 33 Pi was measured. First, the rate of net uptake was measured in vacuoles isolated from wild-type cells transformed with plasmid PDR195-PHT4;6 or with an empty vector. As depicted in [fig10] , the net accumulation rate of 33 Pi was lower in vesicles containing PHT4;6; in other words, this protein counter-acted Pi uptake. By contrast, PHT4;6 did not alter the capacity of vacuole vesicles to establish a proton gradient upon the addition of ATP and no differences were found in the transport of aspartate and glutamate (see below). These data indicated that PHT4;6 transported Pi selectively and suggested that this protein facilitated efflux rather than uptake. To test this further, vesicles were pre-loaded with 33 Pi-spiked potassium phosphate and then transferred to potassium gluconate to measure 33 Pi loss. The results showed a bell-shaped curve with a somehow faster 33 Pi release from PHT4;6 vesicles compared to control vesicles ( [fig10] ). These flux experiments were done twice with similar results. The bell-shaped kinetics of Pi transport by yeast vacuoles have been described before and results from counter-flow exchange (bidirectional transport) with Pi present in the vacuoles at the time of their isolation that is faster than unidirectional Pi efflux ( [bib7] ). In spite of the complex kinetics, Pi inside the vesicles containing PHT4;6 was lower at all time points after transfer to Pi-free buffer ( [fig10] ). Together, these results strongly suggest that PHT4;6 facilitates the transport of Pi from the lumenal space towards the cytosol. Because of the significant sequence similarities with VGLUT proteins and sialin ( [sec1] ), a role of PHT4;6 in the transport of the organic anions glutamate and sialic acid was also tested. Bacteria have several different L-glutamate transport systems, one of which comprises the GltP/GltS uptake system of E. coli . GltP and PHT4;6 proteins share the sodium-dicarboxylate symporter family signature (IPR001991/PR00173), located in the fifth and eighth TM domains of PHT4;6. Cells of E. coli K12 strain cannot grow in medium with glutamate as a sole carbon and nitrogen source, unless GltS or GltP glutamate/aspartate carriers are overexpressed ( [bib77] ). We took advantage of the limited capacity for glutamate uptake of E. coli K12 cells and transformed the full-length cDNA of PHT4;6 into bacteria using the plasmid pBAD24 ( [bib24] ) for arabinose-dependent expression. Growth assays in non-repressed-induced conditions showed that the overexpression of PHT4;6 in E. coli transformants did not improve their ability to grow on glutamate as the sole carbon source. Negative results were also obtained in 14 C-glutamate and 14 C-aspartate transport assays ( [bib49] ) in E. coli cells transformed with pBAD24:PHT4;6 (data not shown). Lastly, transport assays of 14 C-glutamate, 14 C-aspartate, and 14 C-glycine were performed with vacuole vesicles isolated from yeast cells transformed with plasmid pDR195- PHT4;6 as described ( [bib47] ; [bib74] ), also with negative results (data not shown). E. coli K12 strain is able to use sialic acid as the sole carbon source—an ability dependent on the product of genes NanT (sialic acid specific transporter) and NanA (specific aldolase) ( [bib76] ). Bacteria bearing a nanT mutation are unable to grow on sialic acid as the sole carbon source, whereas nanA mutants are sensitive to concentrations of sialic acid as low as 0.1 mM due to the toxic effect of sialic acid accumulation within the cell. The PHT4;6 cDNA was expressed in E. coli cells deficient in the sialic acid permease NanT and in the aldolase NanA by transformation with plasmid pBAD-PHT4;6. Growth tests showed that the expression of PHT4;6 did not alter the growth of bacteria on sialic acid as the sole carbon source of strains EV50 ( nanA4 ) and EV55 ( nanT1 ) ( [bib38] ). Transport assays of 14 C sialic acid in yeast vacuole vesicles (see above) also produced negative results. Together, these results indicate that PHT4;6 is unable to transport organic anions, despite its significant sequence similarity to vertebrate VGLUT proteins and sialin. To determine the expression pattern and regulation of the PHT4 genes, we performed RT–PCR analysis on total RNA from wild-type and pht4;6-1 seedlings subjected to different stress treatments. The PHT4;6 transcript was detected in low amounts in shoots and roots, with relatively higher abundance in the latter (data not shown). The level of PHT4;6 transcript in young seedlings remained unchanged after NaCl treatment and was independent of the presence of Pi in the growth medium ( [fig11] ). Unlike PHT4;6 and other members of the gene family, PHT4;1 expression was up-regulated by NaCl ( [fig11] ). To determine whether PHT4;1 up-regulation by NaCl was affected by the PHT4;6 gene, PHT4;1 expression was determined in the pht4;6-1 mutant. There was no significant difference between PHT4;1 expression in the wild-type and the pht4;6-1 mutant, indicating that there is no compensation at the transcriptional level in response to the dysfunctional PHT4;6 allele. The root branching phenotype of pht4;6 mutant seedlings is not due to abnormal phosphate starvation sensing, as indicated by the unaltered expression pattern in the pht4;6-1 background of the Pi starvation-induced gene AtPT2 ( [bib40] ). PHT4;6 does not affect the signaling pathway that regulates the expression of RD29A , as no difference in the RD29A expression pattern was observed in wild-type and pht4;6-1 backgrounds by RT–PCR ( [fig11] ) and by RD29A:LUC imaging after ABA, cold, or NaCl treatment (not shown).
!~MM~! For in-vitro experiments, Arabidopsis seeds were surface-sterilized (1% sodium hypochlorite and 0.05% Tween 20 for 20 min), imbibed for 3–4 d at 4°C, and germinated onto Murashige and Skoog (MS) salts medium (pH 5.7) supplemented with 3% sucrose and 1.2% agar in a growth chamber under the following conditions: 22°C, ambient relative humidity 60%, white light at 80–100 mmol m −2 s −1 , and 16 h light/8 h dark photoperiod. For liquid cultures, half-strength MS medium (pH 5.7) supplemented with 1% sucrose was used. Liquid cultures were placed onto a gyratory shaker (30 rev. min −1 ) for 10–14 d under continuous fluorescent light at 25°C. For harvesting seeds, plants were sown in soil and grown in a greenhouse. The activation-tagging vector pSKI15 (provided by D. Weigel, The Salk Institute, La Jolla, CA) was used to generate an insertion mutant population (T1) in the Arabidopsis thaliana C24 RD29A:LUC line ( [bib29] ). T1 plants were grouped into 10-line pools and T2 progenies were screened for mutants that exhibited sensitivity to 160 mM NaCl by root bending assay ( [bib82] ) with the modification of using a cellophane membrane to facilitate the transfer of the seedlings from the germination medium to the salt-containing medium. The sequences flanking the T-DNA insertion were determined by TAIL–PCR ( [bib58] ). A nested set of three primers (oriented outward LB1-3) corresponding to sequence in the T-DNA left border and the degenerate primers DEG1 and 2 ( [bib58] ) were used for PCR amplification of genomic DNA from the T2 salt-sensitive mutants. The nucleotide sequence of the PCR products was determined and subjected to BLASTN analysis. The wild-type PHT4;6 allele was obtained by PCR amplification (94°C 2 min (94°C 30 s, 55°C 30 s, 72°C 1 min) × 30 and 72°C 2 min) using specific primers 843B 5′F and 3′R. The position of the T-DNA insertion within the pht4;6.1 allele was determined using primers LB3 and 3′R. The pht4;6-1 mutant line was crossed with its parental wild-type C24 RD29A:LUC and the segregation of the salt-sensitive phenotype in the progeny determined by root bending assays. The wild-type PHT4;6 allele was detected by PCR amplification using specific primers 843-5′F and 843-3′R and the pht4;6.1 allele was detected by using primers 843-3′R and LB3. For allelism tests, a pht4;6-1 line was crossed with a pht4;6-2 line ( Arabidopsis T-DNA ‘G.A.R.L.I.C’ seed lines, Torrey Mesa Research Institute, San Diego, CA, www.nadii.com/pages/collaborations/garlic_files/GarlicDescription.html ) and the resulting F1 and F2 progeny were tested for salt sensitivity. Genomic DNA was isolated from the F1 progeny that exhibited the pht4;6 phenotype under salt-stress conditions. T-DNA insertions were detected by PCR amplification using primers 843-3′R and LB3 ( pht4;6.1 ) and primers 803R and GarLB ( pht4;6.2 ). Salt-stress experiments were conducted with lines pht4;6.1 and pht4;6.2 and their respective parental lines C24 RD29A:LUC and Col-0 and with line sos1-14 (C24 RD29A:LUC background). Four-day-old seedlings were transferred to MS medium supplemented with various salts, as indicated in the figure legends. The plates were placed vertically, and the root tips of each seedling were marked. After a week, root growth was measured. For phosphate treatments, plants were grown in half-strength MS liquid medium supplemented with 1% sucrose. After 10 d, plants were transferred to MS Pi-free medium where KH 2 PO 4 was replaced with K 2 SO 4 to adjust K + concentration and supplemented with different concentrations of Pi (0, 1.25, and 2.5 mM) for 3 d. Harvested seedlings were used for gene expression analysis. RNA was isolated from 12–16-day-old seedlings grown in vitro or 3-week-old greenhouse-grown plants grown in soil in standard greenhouse conditions, and subsequently subjected to different stress treatments using the RNeasy total RNA isolation kit (Qiagen). For reverse transcription–PCR analysis, 2 μg of total RNA from each line were used as a template for reverse transcription using Superscript II (Invitrogen, USA). The complete PHT4;6 gene (1.3 kb) was amplified from a fraction (1/20) of the RT reaction product by PCR (94°C 2 min (94°C 30 sec, 55°C 30 sec, 72°C 2 min) × 27 and 72°C 2 min) using Taq DNA polymerase (Promega, USA) and primers –17 of PHT4;6 and +1 of P HT4;6 .

Sterilized seeds were inoculated onto half-strength liquid MS medium. Ten to 14-day-old seedlings were harvested, rinsed once and treated with fresh liquid medium with or without 150 mM NaCl for 2 d. The seedlings were harvested and rinsed with de-ionized water, and dried at 70°C for 3 d. One hundred milligrams of ground dry matter was then extracted with 10 ml of 0.1 M HNO 3 for 30 min and then filtered through filter paper. Na + and K + contents in the solution were determined by atomic absorption spectrophotometry (Varian SpectrAA-10) ( [bib58] ). For determination of Cl – content, the mercury thiocyanate method and Chloride Reagent (Sigma Diagnostics, USA) were used. The A 460 of the samples was determined by using a spectrophotometer (Shimazu, Japan). Protein sequences homologous to PHT4;6 were identified in public databases using the BLASTP and FASTA search programs available at The Arabidopsis Information Resource (TAIR, www.Arabidopsis.org ). Predicted protein sequences of PHT4;6 were experimentally confirmed by cDNA sequencing. Other protein sequences used to establish the phylogenetic relationships of PHT4;6 were obtained from NCBI ( www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov ). Multiple sequence alignments were performed with CLUSTAL X ( [bib73] ). Unrooted trees were prepared by the neighbor-joining method using PHYLIP ( [bib18] ). The full-length PHT4;6 and PHT4;6:GFP cDNAs were cloned into the yeast expression vector pDR195. Constructs were tested for their ability to complement the growth defects of yeast strains RGY86 ( Δgef1::LEU2 ) ( [bib20] ), PAM2 ( Δpho84::HIS3 , Δpho89::TRP1c ) ( [bib39] ), and JMY75 ( Δpyk1::LEU2 , Δmae1::kanMX , Δjen1::loxP ) ( [bib37] ) in YPD solid medium supplemented with 3 mM MnCl 2 (RGY86 transformants), SD solid medium containing 2% ethanol and 30 mM pyruvate as carbon sources (JMY75 transformants), and SD solid medium containing 0.05 mM Pi with or without 20 mM NaCl at pH 4.5, 6.0, and 7.5. To test the ability of PHT4;6 as a sialic acid transporter, the full-length PHT4;6 cDNA was cloned into the expression vector pBAD24 ( [bib24] ). Growth tests were performed on transformants of the E. coli strains EV50 ( nanA4 ) and EV55 ( nanTI ) ( [bib76] ) in M63 solid medium with 1% glycerol, 0.05% arabinose, and 0.05% sialic acid. Yeast vacuoles were isolated as described ( [bib47] ; [bib55] ). For Pi uptake experiments, vesicles (100 μl of 1.4 μg protein μl −1 ) were diluted in 0.5 ml ice-cold 0.6 M sorbitol, 5 mM Tris-PIPES pH 6.5, and were mixed immediately with an equal volume of 25°C same buffer containing [ 33 P] phosphate (20 μCi ml −1 ), and then incubated at 25°C. Aliquots of 100 μl were removed at various time points, then rapidly filtered through pre-moistened 0.45-μm cellulose ester HAFT-type filters and washed with 6 ml of ice-cold buffered sorbitol. The filters were air-dried, and radioactivity was determined by liquid scintillation counting. For efflux experiments, vesicles (80 μg of protein, from 1.4 μg μl −1 ) were diluted into 5 ml of buffer (50 mM potassium phosphate pH 6.7, 24 mM sucrose) and left on ice overnight. The vesicles were collected by centrifugation at 37 000 g and re-suspended in 20 μl of the same buffer containing 400 μCi ml −1 [ 33 P] phosphate. The vesicles were equilibrated for 15 min at room temperature, and diluted in 1.85 ml of buffer containing 76 mM potassium gluconate, 5 mM MgCl 2 , 5 mM Mes-Tris pH 6.7, pre-warmed to 27°C, then incubated at 27°C. Aliquots of 250 μl were removed at time points and rapidly filtered through pre-moistened 0.45-um cellulose ester HAFT-type filters and washed with 6 ml of ice-cold 0.1 mM LiCl. A PHT4;6:GFP translational fusion was created using the GFPmut1 variant with enhanced fluorescence and optimized for translation in eukaryotic cells ( [bib14] ). The C-terminus of PHT4;6 and the N-terminus of the GFP polypeptides were modified by PCR using oligonucleotides NPCT-Not: 5′-CCACCGCGGCCGCCATCAAAGATCCTTTCTCC-3’ and GFP-Not: 5′-GCTGGCGGCCGCGGTGGTGTGAGCAAGGGCGAGGAGCTG-3’ (NotI recognition sites underlined). NotI digestion of amplified sequences and subsequent ligation generated an in-frame fusion of GFP to the C-terminus of PHT4;6. The GONST1:YFP translational fusion has been described elsewhere ( [bib3] ). Sub-cellular localization in plant cells was performed by monitoring the transient expression of PHT4;6:GFP and GONST1:YFP in onion epidermal cells after DNA particle bombardment using the vector pGreen-35S ( www.pgreen.ac.uk ). Plasmidic DNA was coated onto gold particles (1 μm) and delivered into onion cells using a Biolistic PDS-1000-He apparatus (Bio-Rad). The parameters used were: rupture disks bursting pressure, 900 psi; distance to macrocarrier, 8 mm; distance to stopping screen, 6 mm; distance to target tissue, 6 cm. Onion epidermal cells were placed onto MS medium with 2% sucrose prior to bombardment and then incubated in the dark for 36 h at 28°C after particle delivery. GFP and YFP fluorescence was visualized under a Zeiss Axioskop microscope equipped with a GFP filter set (exciter 450–490 nm; dichroic 495 nm; emitter 500–550 nm; Chroma set 41017). Brefeldin A (Molecular Probes, OR, USA) treatments were carried out by placing bombarded onion cells on microscope glass slides and applying a 180-μM brefeldin A aqueous solution for 2 h in the dark prior to GFP observation. An EcoRV-SpeI(blunt-ended) 2.5-kb DNA fragment containing the complete GFP-tagged PHT4;6 cDNA under the control of the CaMV35S promoter was cloned into the multiple cloning site of the binary vector pBIB–Hyg ( [bib5] ), resulting in the vector pBIB–Hyg–PHT4;6:GFP. Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain GV3101 ( [bib75] ) containing pBIB–Hyg–PHT4;6:GFP was used to transform Arabidopsis lines pht4;6.1 and pht4;6.2 following the floral dip method ( [bib13] ). As controls, lines C24 and Col-0 were transformed with the same vector. Three independent hygromycin-resistant lines from each transformation experiment were selected for further characterization. For complementation analyses, 5-day-old seedlings grown in MS medium supplemented with 35 mg L −1 hygromycin were transferred to MS medium containing 75 and 150 mM NaCl and root elongation was measured after 7 d at 25°C under continuous light. As controls, pht4;6.1 and pht4;6.2 lines harboring the pBIB–Hyg vector were used. For sub-cellular localization of PHT4;6 in Arabidopsis , imaging of GFP fluorescence of 6-day-old seedlings was performed on a Leica SP2 confocal laser scanning microscope. Serial optical sections of 0.5–2 μm were obtained using an excitation wavelength of 488 nm for GFP with emission signals being collected at the emission maxima of 510 nm. Brefeldin A treatments were carried out as described above.
