!~ABS~! Ypt/Rab GTPases act as key regulators of intracellular traffic through the conformational differences exhibited by their GTP or GDP-bound forms. In this paper, two Arabidopsis Ypt6 homologues, AtRAB-H1b and AtRAB-H1c were characterized and compared. Using a live cell imaging approach, it is shown that yellow fluorescent protein-fusions (YFP) of AtRAB-H1b and AtRAB-H1c locate to the Golgi and to the cytosol in both Nicotiana tabacum and in Arabidopsis thaliana. In addition, YFP-AtRAB-H1b targets an as yet unknown compartment not labelled by YFP-AtRAB-H1c or Golgi markers. It is also shown that the subcellular location of YFP-AtRAB-H1b and YFP-AtRAB-H1c is affected by the state of GTP-binding and that expression of a GTP-deficient mutant results in increased apoplastic fluorescence of a secretory form of YFP.
!~RES~! To investigate the location of AtRAB-H1b and AtRAB-H1c in plants, green or yellow fluorescent protein (GFP/YFP) was fused to the N-terminus of AtRAB-H1b (At2g44610) and AtRAB-H1c (At4g39890). This construction has proved successful with several Rab GTPases, as the fusion does not seem to obstruct the location of the protein of interest, although function can be compromised (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION; CITATION; CITATION; CITATION; CITATION). Tobacco leaves were inoculated with serial dilutions of Agrobacterium containing either YFP-AtRAB-H1b or YFP-AtRAB-H1c and the abaxial epidermis was imaged 48–72 h post-inoculation. At OD600 of 0.03 or less, fluorescence from YFP-AtRAB-H1b and YFP-AtRAB-H1c was observed in mobile, punctate, structures approximately 0.5 μm in apparent diameter and also as diffuse cytoplasmic fluorescence (Fig. 1A, B). Co-expression with the Golgi marker ST-GFP (CITATION) revealed that YFP-AtRAB-H1b and YFP-AtRAB-H1c (Fig. 1C–E, Fig. 1F–H) were targeted to the Golgi in this system. Interestingly, YFP-AtRAB-H1b also labelled a second subpopulation of mobile punctate structures with a smaller apparent diameter than the Golgi that were not labelled by ST-GFP (Fig. 1E, arrowhead). These smaller structures were not observed for YFP-AtRAB-H1c (Fig. 1H); indicating a possible difference in targeting of the two AtRab-H isoforms. These smaller structures were also present when AtRAB-H1b was fused to GFP (Fig. 1J–K, arrowhead) and they did not co-locate with a ST-YFP-fusion, suggesting that GFP/YFP-AtRAB-H1b labels a separate compartment (Fig. 1E, K). Similar-sized structures have been observed when GONST1-GFP was transiently transformed into tobacco leaf epidermal cells (CITATION). These were interpreted as artefacts of over-expression although here they were found at varying expression levels of GONST1-GFP. To investigate if these structures are the same as those labelled by YFP-AtRAB-H1b, the two constructs were co-expressed and confocal images were acquired 2 d after infiltration. YFP-AtRAB-H1b co-located with the larger sized structures labelled by GONST1-GFP (Fig. 1L–N), which were earlier identified as Golgi stacks (CITATION). However, YFP-AtRAB-H1b, in most instances, did not co-locate with the subpopulation of smaller structures labelled by GONST1-GFP (Fig. 1N, see arrowhead). [[FIGURE]] [[FIGURE]] To investigate if the small punctate structures labelled with YFP-AtRAB-H1b would co-locate with a marker of the prevacuolar compartment, YFP-AtRAB-H1b was co-expressed with PS1-GFP (BP80-GFP). Little co-location was observed with this marker (Fig. 1 O–Q and insert in Q). Residual labelling of a reticulate network was apparent when YFP-AtRAB-H1b and YFP-AtRAB-H1c were expressed in tobacco. To confirm the background labelling as cytosol and not ER, the constructs were co-expressed with the ER marker GFP-HDEL (CITATION) which marked as expected the polygonal network of short, interconnecting tubules and various shaped cisternae was observed (Fig. 1S). However, the fluorescence seen from the YFP-AtRAB-H1b (Fig. 1R) and the YFP-AtRAB-H1c (data not shown) was more diffuse and did not co-locate with the ER (Fig. 1T). Transgenic A. thaliana, plants expressing YFP-AtRAB-H1b and YFP-AtRAB-H1c were generated. Fluorescence from stably transformed YFP-AtRAB-H1b and YFP-AtRAB-H1cA. thaliana seedlings was observed throughout the plant in YFP-AtRAB-H1b and YFP-AtRAB-H1c transgenics and both fusion constructs were seen to target punctate structures which were highly mobile in the main root, root hairs, and in leaves (Fig. 2A–D). In addition, cytosolic labelling was also observed, as seen in transiently transformed YFP-AtRAB-H1b and YFP-AtRAB-H1c tobacco leaves. Punctate structures labelled by YFP-AtRAB-H1b extensively co-localized with the fluorescent Golgi marker Nag-GFP (CITATION) in root tips (Fig. 3A). To confirm that the labelled structures were Golgi, transgenic RAB-H1b and RAB-H1cA. thaliana were high pressure frozen, freeze-substituted, and immunogold-labelled with GFP anti-serum. Low levels of gold labelling of both constructs were observed on the Golgi. On average, three gold particles were found to be evenly distributed over the Golgi stacks but were not found on other organelles (Fig. 2E, F). [[FIGURE]] [[FIGURE]] [[FIGURE]] [[FIGURE]] When Brefeldin A (BFA) was applied to Arabidopsis root tips expressing Nag-EGFP and YFP-AtRAB-H1b (Fig. 3B, C), a portion of the YFP signal apparently dissociated from the Golgi marker and accumulated in the core of the BFA body that contains endosomal and TGN markers (CITATION; CITATION). The partial relocation of YFP-AtRAB-H1b to the BFA bodies was confirmed by labelling the endosomes and TGN with FM4-64. As shown in Fig. 3D, prior to BFA treatment, FM4-64 labelled compartments showed limited co-localization with YFP-AtRAB-H1b, but were often in close proximity, as reported before for Golgi markers (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION). After a 30 min treatment with 25 μM BFA, YFP co-localized partially with FM4-64 in the core of the BFA body (Fig. 3E, F). Significant quantities of YFP-AtRAB-H1b were excluded from the BFA bodies or remained associated with their periphery where Golgi stacks accumulated (Fig. 3B, C). Thus, a portion of YFP-AtRAB-H1b may exist on BFA-sensitive Golgi-associated TGN or endosomal membranes. Rab GTPases cycle between an active, membrane-bound, GTP-bound form and an inactive cytosolic GDP-bound form. To investigate the nucleotide dependency of YFP-AtRAB-H1b and YFP-AtRAB-H1c labelling pattern, mutants were generated that were predicted to be deficient in GTP-binding, GTP hydrolysis, or nucleotide-binding. Exchanging the serine (S) or threonine (T) of the end of the PM1 region decreases the affinity for both GTP and GDP, but the affinity for GDP has been shown to be higher than for GTP (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION; CITATION). To determine the effect of GDP-binding on the location of the two Rab-H isoforms, T23N mutants of YFP-AtRAB-H1b and YFP-AtRAB-H1c were transiently expressed in tobacco epidermal cells. Two to three days after expression of YFP-AtRAB-H1b[T23N], mobile structures of approximately 0.5 μm were apparent, together with diffuse labelling of the cytosol (Fig. 4A). The YFP-AtRAB-H1b[T23N] labelled punctate structures co-located with the Golgi marker ST-GFP (Fig. 4B–D). However, introduction of the T23N mutation appeared to eliminate targeting to the smaller structures labelled by YFP-AtRAB-H1b[wt] (Fig. 4B–D). [[FIGURE]] [[FIGURE]] Interestingly, when YFP-AtRAB-H1c[T23N], was transiently transformed into tobacco leaf epidermal cells at the same expression level as the wild type, only the cytosolic network was labelled (Fig. 4E). No other structures in the cell were observed to be targeted by this construct, irrespective of the expression level or the time (2–5 d after infiltration) of confocal analysis. When YFP-AtRAB-H1c[T23N] was co-expressed with GFP-HDEL, little or no accumulation on the ER could be detected (Fig. 4F–H). Thus YFP-AtRAB-H1c[T23N] is apparently cytosolic in contrast to the Golgi-labelling observed for YFP-AtRAB-H1b[T23N] (Fig. 4B–E). GTPase-deficient mutants of several small GTPases have been generated by altering glutamate [Q] of the PM3 region to leucine [L] (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION). To investigate the effect of this mutation on the subcellular location of YFP-AtRAB-H1b and YFP-AtRAB-H1c, YFP-AtRAB-H1b[Q68L] and YFP-AtRAB-H1c[Q68L] were expressed in tobacco leaf epidermal cells. At 48 h post-inoculation, both mutants targeted Golgi and the cytosol (Fig. 4I–P). As with YFP-AtRAB-H1b[wt], YFP-AtRAB-H1b[Q68L] labelled a subpopulation of smaller punctate structures that were not targeted by ST-GFP (Fig. 4L, arrowhead) indicating that changing glutamate (Q) to leucine (L) at position 68 did not markedly change the distribution of YFP-AtRAB-H1b. Similarly YFP-AtRAB-H1c[Q68L] located like its wild-type counterpart, to the Golgi but not to the second population of smaller structures labelled by YFP-AtRAB-H1b (Fig. 4N–P). In mammalian cells, over-expression of Rab6A[Q72L] and Rab6A’[Q72L] causes Golgi-located proteins to relocate to the ER in a microtubule-dependent manner (CITATION; CITATION). To determine if the same would occur in plants, Agrobacterium strains harbouring the YFP-AtRAB-H1b[Q68L] and YFP-AtRAB-H1c[Q68L] constructs were infiltrated at increased titres (up to OD600 0.1) and co-expressed with the Golgi-markers ST-GFP, GONST1-GFP, and ERD2-GFP. No effect was observed on the Golgi-location of any of these marker proteins for either RabH construct (data not shown). Mutation of asparagine to isoleucine in the G2 motif is predicted to reduce the affinity of the protein for both GDP and GTP (CITATION). Two days post-inoculation of tobacco leaves with YFP-AtRAB-H1b[N122I] and YFP-AtRAB-H1c[N123I], each protein exhibited purely cytosolic labelling (Fig. 4Q, R) irrespective of the relative expression level or the time of analysis. However, compared to the wild type and other mutants, only a few cells were observed to express YFP-AtRAB-H1b[N122I] and YFP-AtRAB-H1c[N123I], indicating that these mutants might be unstable when transiently expressed. Most Rab proteins are tightly associated with membranes through the post-translational addition of two geranylgeranyl (20-carbon polyisoprenoid) groups to two conserved cysteines in the extreme C-terminus. (Olkkonen and Stenmark, 1997). These two cysteines (C206 and C208) in YFP-AtRAB-H1b[wt] were replaced with serine (S), creating YFP-AtRAB-H1b[C206,208S]. When transiently expressed in tobacco leaf epidermal cells YFP-AtRAB-H1b[C206,208S] was found to be completely cytosolic 2 d after infiltration (Fig. 4S). This result is consistent with the lack of insertion into a membrane owing to the absence of isoprenyl groups. To investigate the stability of YFP-AtRAB-H1b[wt] and the mutants, protein extracts were isolated after 2 d and 4 d from Agrobacterium-transformed YFP-AtRAB-H1b[wt], YFP-AtRAB-H1b[T23N], YFP-AtRAB-H1b[Q68L], YFP-AtRAB-H1b[N122I], and YFP-AtRAB-H1b[C206,208S] tobacco plants. The extracts were probed with anti-GFP antibodies to determine the stability of the YFP-fusions. In all cases, except for YFP-AtRAB-H1b[N122I], a single band of full-length protein including the YFP-fusion was detected indicating that each fusion-construct was stable and that cytosolic labelling did not reflect free YFP (Fig. 5A, B). By contrast, little or no cross-reacting protein was detected in extracts of YFP-AtRAB-H1b[N122I] expressing cells, consistent with the general lack of fluorescence (Fig. 5A, lane 8,9) Similar results were observed for YFP-AtRAB-H1c wild type and mutants (data not shown). [[FIGURE]] [[FIGURE]] CITATION showed that both the wild-type and AtRAB-H1b[C206,208S] were able to bind GTP in a GTP overlay assay. Interestingly, it is shown here that the putatively GDP-bound mutant, YFP-AtRAB-H1b[T23N], is able to bind to the Golgi while the YFP-AtRAB-H1c[T23N] mutant was completely cytosolic. These results could indicate that the two Rab-H isoforms bind to the Golgi in a different manner, where AtRAB-H1b is able to bind the Golgi also in a GDP-bound state. Alternatively, AtRAB-H1b[T23N] may retain normal GTP-binding activity. To establish whether AtRAB-H1b[T23N] is indeed compromised in its ability to bind GTP, AtRAB-H1b[T23N], AtRAB-H1b[wt], AtRAB-H1b[Q68L], and AtRAB-H1b[N122I] were expressed in E. coli and analysed in a GTP overlay assay. AtRAB-H1b[wt] and AtRAB-H1b[Q68L] were found to bind detectable amounts of [α-32P]GTP (Fig. 6, lanes 1, 3). No binding of [α-32P]GTP was observed for AtRAB-H1b[T23N] or AtRAB-H1b[N122I] (Fig. 6, lanes 2, 4) demonstrating that the specific mutations introduced into the proteins had indeed reduced their GTP-binding activities in this assay. [[FIGURE]] [[FIGURE]] As an initial attempt to identify the function of AtRAB-H1b and AtRAB-H1c in plants, the two constructs were expressed in tobacco leaf epidermal cells in both a fluorescent-tagged form and untagged in case the tag inhibited or altered the function of the proteins. The constructs in either their wild-type or mutant forms were expressed along with a number of fluorescent markers locating to different organelles in the cell; ST-GFP (Golgi), GONST1-GFP (Golgi), ERD2-GFP (Golgi/ER), GFP-HDEL (ER), PS1-GFP (prevacuolar compartment), BobTIP-GFP (tonoplast), aleurain-GFP (lytic vacuole), and sporamin-GFP (lytic vacuole). Both AtRAB-H1b and AtRAB-H1c showed no observable effect in over-expression experiments on the distribution of markers targeted to the ER, the Golgi, the prevacuolar compartment, the vacuole, and to the plasma membrane (data not shown). The effect of AtRAB-H1b and AtRAB-H1c on biosynthetic membrane traffic was investigated using a transport assay based on the transport of a secreted YFP, N-secYFPΔc (CITATION) from the ER to the apoplast where it accumulates poorly and exhibits weak fluorescence. This assay is similar to a transport assay using secreted GFP, secGFP, which has previously been used to characterize mutants of AtRAB-D2a, AtRAB-F2b, AtRAB-E1d, and SAR1 (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION; CITATION). When an untagged form of AtRAB-H1b[N122I] was co-expressed with a plasmid that expresses both a secreted YFP marker (N-secYFPΔc; CITATION) and the ER-localized GFP marker GFP-HDEL from the same T-DNA (pVKH18-En6-GFP-HDEL/N-secYFPΔc (Fig. 7A) a significant increase in fluorescence of N-secYFPΔc was observed (Fig. 7B). Clear apoplastic fluorescence was observed at higher magnification (Fig. 7C). When the marker construct was expressed alone, most cells accumulated little or no detectable N-secYFPΔc as expected (CITATION), even though GFP-HDEL was readily detected (Fig. 7D, E). By contrast, co-expression of N-secYFPΔc with AtRAB-D2a[N122I] resulted in an increase in intracellular N-secYFPΔc fluorescence owing to the accumulation of N-secYFPΔc fluorescence in the ER (Fig. 7F, G). A similar result was obtained with the secreted GFP (data not shown). No increase in N-secYFPΔc fluorescence was observed when AtRAB-H1b[wt], AtRAB-H1b[T23N], AtRAB-H1b[Q68L], AtRAB-H1c[wt], AtRAB-H1c[T23N], AtRAB-H1c[Q68L], and AtRAB-H1c[N123I] were co-expressed with the pVKH18-En6-GFP-HDEL/N-secYFPΔ plasmid (data not shown).

!~MM~! To isolate AtRAB-H1b and AtRAB-H1c cDNAs from A. thaliana, total RNA was extracted from leaves using the RNeasy Plant Mini Kit (Qiagen) and was used in a reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) procedure (described in CITATION) with the primers; AT3NY (AtRAB-H1b): 5′-CGCGGATCCGAGCTCCTAACGTGAGGACATTTTTTAG-3′ and AF3NY (AtRAB-H1c): 5′-CGCGGATCCGAGCTCCTAACGTGATCCCTTTTGTTTGCT-3′. cDNA of AtRAB-H1b was amplified using the primers AT3NY and AT5NY: 5′-GTC GGATCCGCGTCGACAGCCATGGCTCCGGTCTCGGCACTC-3′ adding the restriction sites BamHI and SacI (underlined), respectively. cDNA of AtRAB-H1c was amplified using the primers AF3NY and AF3869525: 5′-GTCGGATCCGCGTCGACAGCCATGGCTTCG GTTTCACCTTTG-3′ in a similar manner as described for AtRAB-H1b. Both cDNAs were cloned into the binary vector pVKH18-En6 (CITATION) with either mGFP5 or EYFP (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) at the N-terminus of AtRAB-H1b and AtRAB-H1c. Mutations in functionally important regions of AtRAB-H1b and AtRAB-H1c were created with site-directed mutagenesis using AtRAB-H1b and AtRAB-H1c as templates. AtRAB-H1b[T23N], was designed using the primers: T23N5: 5′-CAA TCCGTCGGCAAGAATTCCATCATTACTCGATCC-3′ and AT3NY; T23N3: 5′-GAATCGAGTAATGATGGAATTCTTGCCGACGGATTG-3′ and AT5NY. The AtRAB-H1c[T23N] mutant was designed with the following primers: AFT23N5: 5′-CAATCTGTCGGAAAGAATTCCATCATCACTCGTTTC-3′ and AF3NY; AFT23N3: 5′-GAAACGAGTGATGATGGAATTCTTTCCGACAGATTG-3’ and AF3869525. AtRAB-H1b[Q68L], was designed using the primers: Q68L5: 5′-TTGTGGGATACAGCAGGCCTAGAGCGATTCAGGAGT-3′ and ATHGTBP3; Q68L3: 5′-ACTCCTGAATCGCTCTAGGCCTGCTGTATCCCACAA-3′ and AT5NY. The AtRAB-H1c[Q68L] mutant was designed with the following primers: AFQ68L5: 5′-CTATGGGATACTGCAGGCCTAGAAAGATTCAGGAGT-3′ and AF3NY; AFQ68L3: 5′-ACTCCTGAATCTTTCTAGGCCTGCAGT-ATCCCATAG-3′ and AF3869525. AtRAB-H1b[N122I] was designed with the primers: I125N5: 5′-GTCATAGTCGTACTAGTGGGAATCAAA ACTGATCTAGTG-3′ and ATHGTBP3; I125N3: 5′-CACTAGATCAGTTTTGATTCCCACTAGTACGACTATGAC-3′ and AT5NY. The AtRAB-H1c[N123I] was designed with the following primers: AFN122I5: 5′-GTTATCATCGTACTAGTTGGAATCAAAACTGATCTTGTTG-3′ and AF3NY; AFN122I3: 5′-CAACAAGATCAGTTTTGATTCCAACTAGTACGATGATAAC-3′ and AF3869525. AtRAB-H1b[C206,208S|, was designed using the primers C-term Rab6: 5′-CGCGGATCCGAGCTCCTAAGAAGAGGATCCTCCTGATTGCTGCTGAGC-3′ and AT5NY. For Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated transformation, strain GV3101 (pMP90) was used for infiltration into Nicotiana tabacum L. cv. SR1. Before infiltration, the plants were grown in a mix of multipurpose compost (Levingtons) and vermiculite in a ratio 3:1 in a greenhouse at 20–23 °C for 6 weeks. Infiltration was performed as previously described (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION) with an inoculum at OD600 of 0.03 if not stated otherwise. Agrobacterium-mediated transformation of YFP-AtRAB-H1b and YFP-AtRAB-H1c into the A. thaliana strain Columbia was performed as described in CITATION. Agrobacterium transiently transformed N. tabacum or A. thaliana stably transformed plants were examined using an inverted Zeiss Confocal Laser Scanning Microscope (CLSM) 510 (Zeiss, Welwyn Garden City, UK). Unless otherwise stated, transiently transformed cells of the lower epidermis of tobacco leaves were analysed 48–72 h after inoculation. This corresponds to 18–42 h after the onset of expression (CITATION). Images were collected using ×10 (dry), ×40 and ×63 oil immersion objectives. For imaging of GFP or YFP alone, a single excitation with a standard 488 nm laser line was used. For multi-track imaging, excitation lines 458 nm for GFP and 514 nm for eYFP were used alternately with line switching in the multi-tracking mode of the microscope (CITATION; CITATION). Fluorescence was detected using a 458 nm/514 nm dichroic beam splitter with 515 nm dichroic filter and 475–525 nm band pass filter for GFP and 535–590 nm band pass filter for eYFP. Controls were carried out to prevent cross-talk and bleed through of fluorescence. To image Nag-EGFP and YFP-AtRAB-H1b in Arabidopsis root tips, 458 nm and 514 nm excitation were used and linear unmixing using the META detector. YFP and FM4-64 was imaged as described by CITATION. The processing of the images was performed using a LSM Image Browser (Zeiss) and Adobe PhotoShop 7.0 software (Mountain view, CA). Leaves from stably transformed YFP-AtRAB-H1b. and YFP-AtRAB-H1c. A. thaliana were placed in MES buffer (20 mM MES, 2 mM CaCl2.2H2O, 2 mM KCl, 0.2 M sucrose, pH 5.5) for 5 min at 150 mm of Hg (2 mbar). Leaf discs of 2 mm were cut out using a disposable biopsy punch (Stiefel Laboratories Ltd, Wooburn Green, UK) and placed in a 0.1 mm cavity of a type A aluminium planchette coated with 100 mg ml−1 lecithin. The specimen was capped with the flat side of a type B aluminium planchette and samples were immediately frozen using a BAL-TEC HPM 010 high-pressure freezer. Subsequent freeze-substitution was undertaken in a Leica AFS (Leica, Vienna, Austria) and, together with resin infiltration, was carried out as described in CITATION. Ultra-thin sections were cut on a PowerTome XL (RMC Products, Tuscon, Arizona) and collected on formvar-coated 300 mesh hexagon nickel grids (Agar Scientific, Stansted, Essex, UK). Sections were blocked for 30 min with a 1:30 dilution of goat serum in TRIS (20 mM TRIS, 15 mM NaN3, 225 mM NaCl), pH 6.9, supplemented with 1% BSA (TRIS-BSA). They were then treated with 0.1% Tween20 in TRIS-BSA and 0.02 M glycine in TRIS-BSA, each for 15 min, washed three times for 10 min in TRIS-BSA, and incubated in a 1:3000 dilution of primary antibody (rabbit anti-GFP polyclonal antibody Molecular Probes, Leiden, The Netherlands) at 4 °C overnight. After washing in TRIS-BSA (three times 15 min), sections were treated with a 1:20 dilution (in TRIS-BSA) of secondary, goat anti-rabbit, antibodies conjugated to 10 nm gold particles (BB International, Cardiff, UK) for 1.5 h (1 h) at room temperature. Finally, after thorough washing in TRIS-BSA and ultrapure water, sections were stained with 2% uranyl acetate in 70% ethanol for 10 min, followed by lead citrate for 15 min, and examined with a JEOL JEM-1200EXII (JEOL, Hertfordshire, UK) at 120 kV. Plant tissue was homogenized in 0.4 N NaOH and 4% β-mercaptoethanol. Proteins in the 10 000 g supernatant were precipitated with 10% TCA (trichloroacetic acid), washed in acetone, and solubilized for SDS-PAGE (CITATION). Transfer to nitrocellulose membranes and antibody incubations were done according to standard protocols. The blot was probed with a polyclonal antibody raised against GFP (1:2000 dilution, Molecular Probes, Leiden, The Netherlands). The reacting polypeptides were visualized with alkaline-phosphatase-conjugated secondary antibody (Dako, Denmark) and BCIP/NBT colour development substrate (Promega, UK) according to the manufacturer's instructions. For expression of AtRAB-H1b wild-type and mutants in E. coli, the AtRAB-H1b wild-type, AtRAB-H1b[T23N], AtRAB-H1b[Q68L], and AtRAB-H1b[N122I] were used as templates. The primers, ATEXPR5: 5′-CGG GATCCCATGGCTCCGGTCTCGGCACTC-3′ and ATEXPR3: 5′-CGCGGATCC CTC GAGACAAGAGCATCCTCCTGATTGCTGCTGAGC-3′ were used including the restriction sites BamHI and XhoI, respectively (underlined). The amplified products were subcloned into the expression vector pET23b(+) containing a C-terminal His-tag sequence. The constructs were transformed into E. coli strain BL21(DE3). Two hours after induction with IPTG, proteins were extracted from the soluble and insoluble fractions. AtRAB-H1b[wt] and AtRAB-H1b[Q68L] were found both in the soluble fraction and also deposited into inclusion bodies in an approximate 1:1 ratio (data not shown). In contrast to the expected GTP-binding of recombinant proteins (wild-type and QL mutant), the AtRAB-H1b[T23N] and AtRAB-H1b[N122I] were only found in the insoluble fraction (data not shown). Since the inclusion body fractions were only partially enriched in the expressed protein, the recombinant proteins were purified before further analysis. The inclusion body fractions were solubilized in 6 M guanidinium hydrochloride and loaded onto NI-NTA agarose spin columns. Equal amounts of purified AtRAB-H1b[wt], AtRAB-H1b[T23N], AtRAB-H1b[Q68L], and AtRAB-H1b[N122I] were loaded onto a SDS-gel. BSA was added as a control for the unspecific binding of GTP. The purified recombinant proteins were blotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane before incubation with radiolabelled [α-32P]GTP. The GTP-binding assay was performed according to the procedure of Celis et al. (1998). ST-GFP has previously been described in CITATION. PS1-GFP is a construct where GFP is fused to the transmembrane and the cytosolic sequence of pea BP80 (CITATION). The construct is identical to BP19 described in CITATION except that all the cytosolic amino acids are present. PS1-GFP has been shown to target the prevacuolar compartment when transiently transformed into tobacco leaf epidermal cells (CITATION). FM 4-64 was added to Arabidopsis roots at 5 μm for 10–20 min prior to observation with BFA treatment at 25 μM for 30–40 min.
