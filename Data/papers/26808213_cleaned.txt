!~ABS~! Mutation of the immunophilin-like FK506-binding protein TWISTED DWARF1 (FKBP42/TWD1) causes dwarf and twisted-organ phenotypes in Arabidopsis . However, the function of FKBP42 is not fully understood at the molecular level. Using genetic, physiological, and immunological experiments, we show here that FKBP42/TWD1 is necessary for brassinosteroid (BR) signal transduction. The twd1 mutant showed reduced BR sensitivity in growth responses and activation of the BZR1 transcription factor. However, twd1 showed normal responses to an inhibitor of BIN2/GSK3, suggesting that twd1 has a defect upstream of BIN2 in the BR signaling pathway. In vitro and in vivo assays showed that TWD1 interacts physically with the kinase domains of the BR receptor kinases BRI1 and BAK1. TWD1 is not required for normal localization of BRI1-GFP to the plasma membrane or for activation of the flagellin receptor kinase FLS2. Our results suggest that FKBP42/TWD1 plays a specific role in the activation of BRI1 receptor kinase.
!~RES~! It has been reported that the ucu2 mutants (alleles of twd1 ) showed reduced responses to 24-epibrassinolide inhibition of root growth and expression of CPD and ROT3 ( [bib24] ). Consistent with the previous study, we found that the twd1-2 (Salk_012836) mutant was less sensitive than wild-type plants to brassinolide (BL, the most active form of BRs), in root growth and hypocotyl elongation ( [fig1] A and B ). Furthermore, high concentrations of BL (50–100 nM) did not promote hypocotyl elongation in twd1 seedlings, in contrast to wild-type Col-0 ( [fig1] B). These results suggest that FKBP42/TWD1 is required for normal BR signal transduction. To determine genetic interaction between FKBP42/TWD1 and the BR signaling pathway, we crossed twd1 with transgenic plants expressing the gain-of-function bzr1-1D-CFP ( pBZR1:bzr1-1D-CFP ), in which the mutation leads to a constitutively active, hypophosphorylated form of BZR1 due to increased affinity to PP2A phosphatases ( [bib31] ). Phenotypic analyses of 3-week old pBZR1:bzr1-1D-CFP/twd1 and pBZR1:BZR1-CFP/twd1 comparing with twd1 showed that the bzr1-1D mutation partially suppressed the dwarf phenotype of twd1 ( [fig1] C), which is similar to bzr1-1D suppression of bri1 ( [bib33] ). The results suggest that FKBP42/TWD1 is involved in BR signaling upstream of BZR1. To determine if FKBP42/TWD1 regulates BZR1 activities by regulating BIN2, we treated seedlings with bikinin, an inhibitor of GSK3/BIN2 kinases ( [bib8] ), compared with BL and mock treatments. We determined BZR1 phosphorylation status by western blotting using transgenic lines expressing pBZR1:BZR1-CFP in Col-0 and twd1 . Western blot results demonstrated that, without BL treatment, twd1 accumulated a higher level of inactive, phosphorylated forms of BZR1-CFP protein (57.6% phosphorylated) than wild-type (42.1% phosphorylated) ( [fig2] A ). Furthermore, treatment of 100 nM BL for 20 min only partially dephosphorylated BZR1-CFP in twd1 (88.3% dephosphorylated), whereas the same treatment almost fully dephosphorylated BZR1-CFP in wild-type (96.2% dephosphorylated) ( [fig2] A). The reduced responsiveness to BR in terms of BZR1 dephosphorylation in twd1 is consistent with the reduced BR responses observed in root growth inhibition and hypocotyl elongation ( [fig1] ). However, unlike BR treatment, treatment with bikinin, an inhibitor of BIN2 kinase, induced similar dephosphorylation of BZR1 in wild-type and twd1 (99.1% and 98.0% dephosphorylated BZR1-CFP in wild-type and twd1 , respectively) ( [fig2] A). Bikinin also induced similar growth responses in wild-type and twd1 ( [fig2] B). Thus, the results suggest that FKBP42/TWD1 is likely involved in the BR signaling pathway upstream of BIN2. Next, we tested whether BR signaling components upstream of BIN2, such as BRI1, BAK1 and BSKs, interact with FKBP42/TWD1. First, protein-protein interactions were tested in vitro by gel blot overlay assays. The GST, GST-tagged kinase domains of BRI1 and BAK1, and GST-tagged BIN2 and BSK1 were gel blotted and probed with MBP-tagged FKBP42 protein. The results further indicated that FKBP42/TWD1 interacts with the kinase domains of BRI1 and BAK1 but not BIN2 or BSK1 ( [fig3] A ). This interaction was further confirmed in vivo by bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) assays. Tobacco epidermal cells co-transformed with the amino-terminal half of yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) fused to the amino terminus of FKBP42 (nYFP-FKBP42), and BRI1 or BAK1 fused to the carboxy-terminal half of cyan fluorescent protein (BRI1-cCFP and BAK1-cCFP) showed strong fluorescence signals, similar to the signals of BRI1-nYFP and BAK1-cCFP, which served as a positive control ( [fig3] B). The BiFC signal of nYFP-FKBP42 and BRI1-cCFP was co-localized with the fluorescence signal of plasma membrane intrinsic protein (PIP) aquaporin (PIP2;1-mCherry) ( [fig3] C), which has been shown to be localized at the plasma membrane and endosomal membrane mediated through endocytosis ( [bib37] ). Treatment of the leaf tissues with BL or propiconazole (PPZ), which blocks BR biosynthesis, did not obviously alter the interaction between nYFP-FKBP42 and BRI1-cCFP ( [fig3] C and D), suggesting that FKBP42/TWD1 interacts with BRI1 in a BR-independent manner. Tobacco leaves co-transformed with nYFP-FKBP42 and BSK3-cCFP showed no fluorescence signal ( [fig3] D). Thus, the results suggest that FKBP42/TWD1 affects BR signaling by binding to the kinase domains of the receptors BRI1 and BAK1. A previous study has demonstrated that FKBP42/TWD1 is required for localization of plasma membrane protein ABCB auxin transporters and mutations in TWD1 lead to mislocalization of ABCB1, ABCB4, and ABCB19 to the ER instead of the plasma membrane ( [bib36 bib35] ). To test whether FKBP42/TWD1 is also necessary for localization of the BRI1 receptor to the plasma membrane, we crossed transgenic plants expressing GFP-tagged BRI1 ( pBRI1:BRI1-GFP ) with the twd1 mutant. Confocal microscopic analysis demonstrated that the root tips of Col-0 wild-type and twd1 exhibited similar BRI1-GFP fluorescence intensities ( [fig4] A ). We detected BRI1-GFP signals at the plasma membrane and in the endocytic vesicles, which were labeled with propidium iodide (for plasma membrane) and FM4-64 (for plasma membrane and endosomal membrane) ( [fig4] B), consistent with the results reported in a previous study ( [bib25] ). Our results showed that subcellular localization of BRI1-GFP was not affected in the twd1 mutant ( [fig4] B). Quantification of GFP fluorescence intensities further supported that the twd1 mutation did not significantly alter BRI1-GFP levels ( [fig4] C). Thus, unlike the ABCB proteins, BRI1 localization to the plasma membrane does not require TWD1. Our results suggest that FKBP42/TWD1 functions in the BR signaling pathway by means of protein-protein interaction with the BRI1 and BAK1 receptor kinases. To determine whether FKBP42/TWD1 plays a specific role in BR signaling or also modulates other receptor kinase pathways, we tested the effect of twd1 mutation on flagellin responses, which is mediated by the FLS2 and BAK1 receptor kinases ( [bib5 bib16] ). Treatments with flagellin (flg22) for 7 days reduced growth (indicated by fresh weight) in twd1 more than wild-type ( [fig5] A ). Time-course analysis of flg22-induced MAP kinase (MAPK) activation by western blotting indicated that twd1 responded to flg22 more strongly than wild-type plants after 10 and 30 min of flg22 treatment ( [fig5] B). Quantitative RT–PCR analysis of expression of flagellin-induced genes, FRK1 and AT2G17740 , showed that twd1 was slightly more responsive than wild-type to flg22 treatment ( [fig5] C). These observations of enhanced flg22 responses in twd1 suggest that FKBP42/TWD1 is not required for FLS2 and BAK1 functions in mediating immunity signaling and that FKBP42/TWD1 might negatively regulate flg22 responses either directly through interaction with BAK1 or indirectly through reduced BR signaling, which is known to antagonize flagellin responses ( [bib32] ).
!~MM~! All wild-type, various mutants, and transgenic lines are in the Arabidopsis thaliana Columbia (Col-0) background. These include twd1-2 (Salk_012836), bzr1-1D ( [bib33] ), pBZR1:BZR1-CFP , pBZR1:bzr1-1D-CFP ( [bib14] ), and pBRI1:BRI1-GFP ( [bib10] ). Seeds were surface sterilized and plated on half-strength Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium containing 1% sucrose, 0.8% Phytoblend agar, and indicated chemicals, hormones or mock. Plates were placed vertically under constant light. Root lengths were measured from images using ImageJ. The coding sequence of full-length FKBP42/TWD1 was first cloned into pENTRY/SD/D-TOPO vector (Invitrogen), and then subcloned into the gateway-compatible pnYFP ( [bib11] ) and pMALc2 (New England Biolab) vectors to generate 35S:nYFP-FKBP42 for BiFC experiments and 35S:MBP-FKBP42 for overlay assays, respectively. The 35S:nYFP-FKBP42 construct was transformed into Nicotiana benthamiana via Agrobacterium tumefaciens GV3101. For BZR1 and MAPK activation analyses, total protein samples were extracted from 7-day-old seedlings or 12-day-old seedlings using 2× SDS sample buffer and separated on SDS–PAGE gels. Proteins were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane and probed with a monoclonal anti-GFP antibody (Clontech; 1:2000 dilution) or anti-phosphop44/42 mitogen-activated protein kinase (Erk1/2) (Thr202/Tyr204) antibody (Cell Signaling; 1:1000 dilution). For overlay assays, GST-BRI1-K, GST-BAK1-K, GST-BIN2, GST-BSK1 ( [bib30] ), and MBP-FKBP42 were expressed in Escherichia coli and purified using glutathione agarose beads (GE Healthcare) or amylase agarose beads (New England Biolabs) as previously described ( [bib30] ). To test the interaction of FKBP42 with BR signaling components in vitro , GST, GST-BRI1-K, GST-BAK1-K, GST-BIN2, and GST-BSK1 were separated by SDS–PAGE and blotted on nitrocellulose membrane. The blot was then incubated with MBP-FKBP42 (4 μg) in 5% non-fat dry milk/PBS buffer for 1 h, washed three times, and then probed with a monoclonal anti-MBP antibody (New England Biolabs, 1:4000) for 1 h. Overlay signal was detected using the SuperSignal West Dura chemiluminescence reagent (Pierce). BiFC analysis was performed according to a previous study ( [bib11] ). In brief, Agrobacterium cells containing BiFC expression vectors or 35S:PIP2;1-mCherry construct ( [bib9] ) were resuspended in the induction medium and infiltrated into young leaves of 4-week-old Nicotiana benthamiana (tobacco) plants, which were grown in greenhouses under 16-h light/8-h dark conditions. At 36–72 h after infiltration, fluorescent signals in the infiltrated epidermal cells of tobacco were observed using confocal microscopy. Laser scanning confocal microscopy was performed on either a Leica SP5 or SP8 system. BiFC YFP fluorescence was visualized by excitation at 514 nm and emission at 520–580 nm with 63× numerical aperture (NA) = 1.20 water immersion objective ( [fig3] B left, [fig3] E–F) or 20× NA = 0.75 objective ( [fig3] B center and right, [fig3] C–D). In [fig3] C, YFP and mCherry fluorescence was visualized by excitation at 488 nm and emission at 500–550 nm and 575–625 nm, respectively. In [fig4] , fluorescence was visualized by excitation at 488 nm and emission at 500–550 nm (GFP), 650–700 nm (PI), and 700–725 nm (FM4-64) with 20× NA = 0.75 objective ( [fig4] A) or 63× NA = 1.30 glycerine immersion objective ( [fig4] B). Quantification of BRI1-GFP intensities in root epidermal cells was performed in ImageJ. Areas of 20 μm × 20 μm were selected, and the mean intensity value of each selection was calculated. Averages of the mean GFP intensity values were calculated with Microsoft Excel. The seedling growth inhibition assay was carried out following a previous study ( [bib2] ). Seedlings were grown on half-strength MS medium containing 1% sucrose under constant light for 5 days, then transferred to liquid half-strength MS medium containing 1% sucrose supplemented with the indicated concentrations of flg22 peptides. Seedlings were weighed 7 days after treatment. Whole seedlings were harvested for total RNA extraction using the Spectrum Plant Total RNA kit (Sigma). For quantitative RT–PCR, the total RNA was used to prepare the first-strand cDNA using RevertAid reverse transcriptase (Fermentas). Quantitative RT–PCR was performed on a LightCycler 480 (Roche) using SYBR Green reagent (Bioline) with gene-specific primers: FRK1-F 5′-ATC TTC GCT TGG AGC TTC TC-3′; FRK1-R 5′-TGC AGC GCA AGG ACT AGA G-3′; AT2G17740-F 5′-TGC TCC ATC TCT CTT TGT GC-3′; AT2G17740-R 5′-ATG CGT TGC TGA AGA AGA GG-3′; PP2A-F 5′-TAT CGG ATG ACG ATT CTT CGT GCA G-3′; PP2A-R 5′-GCT TGG TCG ACT ATC GGA ATG AGA G-3′. Three biological replicates were used in the analysis.
