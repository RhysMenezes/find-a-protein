!~ABS~! The MRS2/MGT gene family in Arabidopsis thaliana belongs to the superfamily of CorA-MRS2-ALR-type membrane proteins. Proteins of this type are characterized by a GMN tripeptide motif (Gly-Met-Asn) at the end of the first of two C-terminal transmembrane domains and have been characterized as magnesium transporters. Using the recently established mag-fura-2 system allowing direct measurement of Mg2+ uptake into mitochondria of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, we find that all members of the Arabidopsis family complement the corresponding yeast mrs2 mutant. Highly different patterns of tissue-specific expression were observed for the MRS2/MGT family members in planta. Six of them are expressed in root tissues, indicating a possible involvement in plant magnesium supply and distribution after uptake from the soil substrate. Homozygous T-DNA insertion knockout lines were obtained for four members of the MRS2/MGT gene family. A strong, magnesium-dependent phenotype of growth retardation was found for mrs2-7 when Mg2+ concentrations were lowered to 50 μM in hydroponic cultures. Ectopic overexpression of MRS2-7 from the cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter results in complementation and increased biomass accumulation. Green fluorescent protein reporter gene fusions indicate a location of MRS2-7 in the endomembrane system. Hence, contrary to what is frequently found in analyses of plant gene families, a single gene family member knockout results in a strong, environmentally dependent phenotype.
!~RES~! The Arabidopsis MRS2 gene family was originally described as encompassing 10 genomic loci, including one presumptive pseudogene, MRS2-9 (CITATION). A nearly simultaneous report of the gene family (CITATION) introduced the alternative MGT nomenclature and left the MRS2-9 pseudogene unaccounted for but added a member with more distant similarity, MGT10, now also referred to as MRS2-11 (CITATION). The complete rice (Oryza sativa) genome sequence allows comparative inferences concerning differential diversification of the gene family in this monocot compared with the dicot Arabidopsis. The members of the At MRS2/MGT gene family have their counterparts in nine proteins encoded in the genome of rice (Figure 1 ). [[FIGURE]] Five clades of Arabidopsis MRS2/MGT genes were observed (Figure 1), and for these we here suggest labels A through E, with characteristic intron insertion sites for each type of gene. We found that all 12 introns in MRS2-11 (and its rice ortholog Os03g48000) are unique to clade A as can be inferred from different intron phases of closely spaced introns for which we suggest a nomenclature (see Supplemental Figure 1 online). Only clades B through E share three ancient introns in phase 0, which are occasionally lost later in evolution of the gene family (Figure 1). Given that MRS2-1, the founding member of the Arabidopsis gene family, was initially characterized by its ability to complement the yeast mrs2 mutant when targeted to mitochondria (CITATION), we reasoned that other members of the gene family would behave similarly, if possibly to differing degrees. Accordingly, we have now cloned a series of constructs containing the core coding regions of all MRS2 genes (except for the pseudogenes MRS2-8 and MRS2-9). These constructs were fused to the yeast Mrs2p mitochondrial targeting sequence and are driven from the native yeast MRS2 promoter in the vector YEp351. Complementation of the mrs2 respiratory deficiency is easily monitored by restoration of the growth defect on nonfermentable medium with glycerol as the main carbon source (YPdG). Growth of yeast transformants containing Arabidopsis constructs was indistinguishable from growth of the yeast mrs2 mutant transformed with the native Mrs2p coding sequence or the empty vector on nonselective YPD medium, indicating that these constructs do not interfere with yeast metabolism (Figure 2 , left panels). We found that members of the MRS2 gene family were able to complement the mrs2 phenotype to similar degrees (Figure 2, right panels). MRS2-6 reconstituted growth to the highest level among the Arabidopsis proteins but was clearly less efficient compared with wild-type Mrs2p. [[FIGURE]] The molecular analysis of mrs2 complementation using MRS2-1 showed that splicing of mitochondrial group II introns was restored (CITATION). This phenomenon is now known to be an indirect effect through providing appropriate Mg2+ levels for group II intron ribozyme function in the yeast mitochondria (CITATION). An indication for a direct involvement of MRS2-1 in mitochondrial Mg2+ uptake, however, had been obtained through measurements of mitochondrial magnesium content, which reached nearly the wild-type level upon complementing the yeast mutant (CITATION). In the meantime, a system for direct Mg2+ uptake measurements in yeast mitochondria has been developed using the fluorescent dye mag-fura-2, allowing a more direct confirmation of Mg2+ transport over biological membranes in real time, has been set up (CITATION). Mag-fura-2 is a UV-excitable, Mg2+-dependent fluorescent indicator that undergoes a blue shift from 380 to 340 nm upon Mg2+ binding. Accordingly, mitochondria were isolated from all yeast strains transformed with the Arabidopsis MRS2 constructs to measure the magnesium uptake levels after external application of increasing Mg2+ concentrations in mag-fura-2–loaded mitochondria. Mg2+ uptake was indeed measurable for all constructs to different extents, confirming their role as proteins mediating magnesium transport. Representative Mg2+ uptake recordings are shown in Figure 3 . High magnesium uptake efficiencies were observed for MRS2-1, MRS2-7, and MRS2-10, whereas the other proteins proved somewhat less efficient uptake. A discrepancy was observed for MRS2-3, which appeared to complement well in the growth assay (Figure 2) but showed magnesium uptake that was not considerably higher than the background mutant level. Possibly, MRS2-3 acts as a comparatively slow transporter for Mg2+ (at least in the foreign yeast mitochondrial membrane environment), allowing for ion homeostasis over periods of hours as in the growth assays but not in measurable amounts over shorter time intervals, such as minutes as in the uptake experiments. [[FIGURE]] To address their potential differential functions in planta, the upstream regions of all MRS2 genes were fused to the GUS reporter gene to investigate the tissue specificities of their promoters. We chose to clone >1000 bp of upstream noncoding regions, including the first coding exon of the MRS2 genes, as translational fusions in front of GUS to maximize the inclusions of targets for regulatory influence on gene expression. Highly different tissue-specific patterns of gene expression during development were observed for the members of the MRS2 gene family (Figure 4 , Table 1 ). Several genes showed expression already at very early developmental stages of the seedlings. Nearly ubiquitous expression was observed in 3-d-old seedlings of MRS2-1 and MRS2-5 (Figures 4A and 4B), while expression was restricted to the radicle excluding the tip in the case of MRS2-10 (Figure 4C). [[FIGURE]] Summary of MRS2/MGT Gene Activities as Determined from GUS Activities in Transgenic Promoter-GUS Fusion Lines (Figure 4) Expression of other genes began somewhat later in development (e.g., in the case of MRS2-3 in the central cylinder of the root; Figure 4D), interestingly with additional strong expression in the meristematic zone and in the hypocotyl (Figure 4E). Likewise, expression of MRS2-2 was strictly restricted to the central cylinder (Figure 4F) and the veins (Figure 4G) at the early seedling stage. The absence of MRS2-2 expression in the root tip (Figure 4F) similar to MRS2-10 (Figure 4C) was merely complementary to the more widespread expression of MRS2-1 in the different tissues of the root, most dominantly in the root tip (Figure 4B). In the photosynthetic organs, the early ubiquitous expression of MRS2-1 and MRS2-5 (Figure 4A) became more localized to the vascular tissues of the expanded cotyledons during development, notably with a strong focus of MRS2-5 gene expression in the early development of the first postcotyledon leaf pair (Figure 4H). This contrasted the highly localized expression of MRS2-10 in the hydathodes of the cotyledons (Figure 4I) and the epicotyl (Figure 4J). Whereas expression of MRS2-7 was entirely restricted to the root at the seedling stage (Figure 4K), a completely contrasting picture was observed for MRS2-4 and MRS2-11 with strong expression in photosynthetic tissues from the earliest stages of cotyledon development onwards (Figures 4L and 4M). A unique particularity of MRS2-11 was its pronounced expression in stomata guard cells (Figures 4M and 4N). Expression of MRS2-4 in aboveground organs continued through plant development (e.g., in older leaves; Figure 4O) and the sepals of the developing flower (Figure 4P). In strong contrast, expression of the phylogenetically related MRS2-6 gene (Figure 1) was particularly restricted and could only be observed in pollen grains (Figures 4Q and 4R). Complementary gene activities in the male flower parts were observed in the filaments for MRS2-3 and MRS2-10 (Figures 4S and 4T). Expression in the maturing seeds was observed for MRS2-2 (Figures 4U and 4V). At later stages of development, pronounced gene activity was seen for MRS2-1 in the style and coat of the silique (Figure 4W). Particularly strong overall gene expression was again observed for MRS2-4 at an early stage of silique development with the exception of the stigma (Figure 4X). Later, in the fully developed silique, MRS2-4 gene expression was restricted to the abscission zone, as also observed for MRS2-11 (Figure 4Y). The focus of MRS2-2 expression in vascular tissue in early stages of development continued later through development as, for example, in the veins during early bud development (Figure 4Z). Observation of shoot cross sections after xylem counterstaining with safranin demonstrated expression in the phloem (Figure 4Za). MRS2-10, phylogenetically very close to MRS2-1, interestingly showed a very cell type–specific expression not only in early stages of development (Figures 4C, 4I, and 4J) but also a pronounced expression in trichomes (Figure 4Zb). Publicly available microarray data (www.genevestigator.com) so far give no indication for environmental regulation of the MRS2 genes, and, similarly, we could not observe any obvious variability in gene expression when the MRS2-GUS lines were grown on different magnesium concentrations in hydroponic culture systems (see below). To address the issue of potential magnesium dependent gene regulation yet more explicitly, we performed RT-PCR analyses using Arabidopsis plantlets raised on 50, 500, or 1500 μM Mg2+ to detect potential changes in transcript amounts. No evidence for magnesium-dependent regulation for any of the MRS2 genes was observed (see Supplemental Figure 2 online). To further address the function of MRS2 proteins in planta, we searched for gene-specific inactivation lines to investigate mutant phenotypes. Candidates for 17 transgenic Arabidopsis lines with T-DNA insertions in (or close to) members of the MRS2 gene family and potentially affecting the respective gene functions were identified in the SALK (and GABI-KAT) collections (http://signal.salk.edu/cgi-bin/tdnaexpress; see Supplemental Table 1 online) for all genes except MRS2-4. Seeds for all insertion lines except those of the pseudogenes MRS2-8 and MRS2-9 were ordered, and the progeny were investigated to first verify the genomic insertion through a PCR-based strategy. Subsequently, we tried to raise homozygous insertion lines and confirm the knockout of transcription. Among the insertion lines, one could not be verified as harboring the insertion, and among the remaining lines, five could only be obtained in the heterozygous state. A transcriptional knockout was not observed for any of the other lines having insertions outside of the coding regions but could be confirmed for a total of six lines with insertions within the coding regions of four genes in the family (see Supplemental Figure 3 online): one each for MRS2-1, MRS2-5, and MRS2-10 and three independent KO lines for MRS2-7. Furthermore, double KO mutant lines of MRS2-1 + MRS2-5 and MRS2-5 + MRS2-10 could be obtained via crossing and screening for progeny homozygous in both insertion alleles. All six single-gene KO lines [mrs2-1, mrs2-5, mrs2-7(1), mrs2-7(2), mrs2-7(3), and mrs2-10] and the two double KO lines mrs2-1 mrs2-5 and mrs2-5 mrs2-10 appeared fully vital without obvious phenotypes under standard growth conditions and went through a normal reproductive cycle, initially suggesting strong genetic redundancy in the gene family or its subclades, respectively. To explore the possibility that a certain mrs2-related phenotype may be seen only in conditions of Mg2+ stress, we set up two different culture systems: a hydroponic and a liquid culture system. For the hydroponic culture system, we allowed plants to complete their life cycle under defined growth conditions. We found that wild-type Arabidopsis (ecotype Columbia [Col-0]) tolerates the full range of Mg2+ concentrations between 50 μM and 5 mM under the otherwise unaltered ion concentrations of the Siegenthaler culture medium (CITATION). Hence, MgSO4 concentrations ranging between micro- and millimolar levels were used to scan for Mg2+-dependent phenotypes among the T-DNA insertion lines. While the knockout lines mrs2-1, mrs2-5, and mrs2-10 and the double knockouts mrs2-1 mrs2-5 and mrs2-5 mrs2-10 remained as unaffected by the varying Mg2+ concentrations as the wild type, a striking phenotype was observed for the knockout line mrs2-7(2). Plantlets were severely retarded in development under 50 μM Mg2+ (Figure 5A ). Raising the Mg2+ concentrations to slightly higher levels (150 μM) immediately restored this phenotype practically to wild-type growth, and the mutant plants remained unaffected by yet higher magnesium concentrations. [[FIGURE]] To exclude that any additional genomic rearrangements were responsible for the low Mg2+ phenotype observed, we also investigated the two alternative KO lines in MRS2-7, which could also be obtained in the homozygous state. These lines, mrs2-7(1) and mrs2-7(3), also carry, like the initially characterized mutant mrs2-7(2), T-DNA insertions in introns of the MRS2-7 gene. Exactly the same phenotype as for the mrs2-7(2) KO line was observed (Figure 5B), confirming that inactivity of MRS2-7 indeed is the fundamental cause for the low Mg2+ phenotype. To determine whether KO of MRS2-7 affects ion homeostasis more globally, we used the Purdue Ionomics service (CITATION; CITATION; www.ionomicshub.org), offering comprehensive ion content analyses. For all three independent mrs2-7 KO lines, no significant imbalances in homeostasis of Mg2+ or any one of 17 other ions were observed under normal growth conditions in the ionomics measurements other than a possible 10 to 20% reduction of K+ in comparison to the wild type (see Supplemental Figure 4 online). As no similar phenotypes could be observed for the KO lines mrs2-1, mrs2-5, and mrs2-10 and even for the double KO mutants, we tried to investigate potentially more subtle differences in these mutants using a liquid culture system containing Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium with 50 and 100 μM of MgSO4. The liquid media were supplemented with sucrose to allow enhanced seedling growth, while any other complex compounds that might contribute spurious amounts of Mg2+ were excluded. Additionally, a stable transgenic complementation line harboring the MRS2-7 coding sequence under control of the constitutive CaMV 35S promoter within the mrs2-7(2) background was investigated. As observed in the hydroponic culture, KO lines mrs2-1, mrs2-5, and mrs2-10 never showed significant differences compared with the wild type under any condition tested (data not shown). By contrast, the mrs2-7 KO line failed to germinate under these liquid culture conditions, whereas the MRS2-7–overexpressing line revealed a strong increase in biomass production under 50 μM and a slight increase under 100 μM MgSO4 compared with wild-type seedlings (Figure 6 ). This germination phenotype of mrs2-7 prompted us to reinvestigate the earliest stages of MRS2-7 gene expression. Indeed, the MRS2-7:GUS reporter line showed very specific expression of MRS2-7 very early in the quiescent zone of the emerging radicle (Figure 7 ). This finding is in full accord with the high-resolution transcriptional profiling of the Arabidopsis root quiescent center (CITATION). [[FIGURE]] [[FIGURE]] Given that a first magnesium-related phenotype is now identified in planta for a member of the MRS2/MGT gene family, we wished to determine the subcellular localization of MRS2-7. The full-length coding sequence of MRS2-7 was cloned as a translational fusion upstream of the green fluorescent protein (GFP) under control of the CaMV 35S promoter. The construct was used for transient transformation of Nicotiana benthamiana leaves via Agrobacterium tumefaciens followed by laser scanning confocal fluorescence microscopy (Figure 8 ). GFP fluorescence was observed in the endomembrane system, suggesting targeting to the endoplasmatic reticulum (ER). As a control experiment, we used the ER-targeted HDEL:DsRED construct (CITATION) in a cotransformation assay. Nearly perfectly overlapping expression with the MRS2-7:GFP construct was observed. [[FIGURE]]
!~MM~! Arabidopsis thaliana ecotype Col-0 and T-DNA insertion lines in MRS2/MGT genes were obtained from the European Arabidopsis Stock Centre. T-DNA insertions were confirmed, homozygous lines raised, and gene knockout on the transcript level was finally confirmed for six lines in four of the MRS2/MGT genes (see Supplemental Table 1 and Supplemental Figure 2 online). Additionally, two double KO lines were successfully obtained via crossing: mrs2-1 mrs2-5 and mrs2-5 mrs2-10. Arabidopsis seeds were surface sterilized (CITATION) and sown on MS medium (Duchefa Biochemie) supplemented with 1% sucrose, 0.05% MES, pH 5.7 (KOH), and 0.8% bacto agar. Transgenic plants were selected in the presence of 50 μg/mL kanamycin. All plants were stratified for 2 d at 4°C and grown under 16 h of light photoperiods at 24°C and ∼100 μmol/m2/s light intensity. Hydroponic cultivation of Arabidopsis plants (CITATION) was modified, using either opaque filter tip containers or the Araponics growing system (Araponics) and nutrient solutions with varying concentrations of magnesium. Nutrient solutions were replaced every 2 weeks or immediately upon indication of emerging algal growth. Liquid cultivation of germinating Arabidopsis seeds was done in conical flasks incubated on a rotary shaker at 100 rpm. Liquid media were based on MS medium mentioned above, which was adjusted to different magnesium concentrations. Comprehensive ionomics measurements with inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry were performed using the Purdue Ionomics Information Management System (CITATION). All plasmid constructs were cloned by recombination of PCR products into destination vectors using Gateway technology (Invitrogen). GUS (uidA) reporter gene constructs comprised the noncoding upstream region and the first exon of each MRS2 gene cloned in frame upstream of GUS into vector pKGWFS7 (CITATION). The full-length MRS2-7 (At5g09690.1) coding sequence was cloned behind the CaMV 35S promoter in vector pK7WG2D (CITATION) for overexpression and upstream of GFP in translational fusion into vector pMDC83 (CITATION), respectively. Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain GV3101 pMP90 (CITATION) was transformed with the binary vector constructs (CITATION) and used to transform developing floral tissues of 4-week-old Arabidopsis plants using the floral dip method (CITATION). Total RNAs were prepared from 2-week-old Arabidopsis plantlets grown in liquid cultures or rosette leafs from adult plants grown on soil using the NucleoSpin RNA plant kit (Macherey-Nagel), and cDNA was synthesized with the Transcriptor High Fidelity cDNA synthesis kit (Roche Diagnostics) applying anchored-oligo (dT)18 primer with equalized amounts of template RNA. Expression levels of the target genes were determined after 30, 35, and 40 cycles of gene-specific PCR amplification via gel electrophoresis and ethidium bromide staining. To detect GUS activity, Arabidopsis plant samples or entire seedlings were infiltrated with substrate solution (1 mM 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-glucuronic acid, 100 mM sodium phosphate buffer, at pH 7.0, 10 mM EDTA, 3 mM ferrocyanide, 0.5 mM ferricyanide, and 0.1% Triton X-100) at 37°C for 16 h (CITATION). After staining, chlorophyll was removed with 70% ethanol at 37°C. For sectioning before microscopy, plant samples were placed in fixation buffer (50 mM PIPES, 1.5% glutaraldehyde, and 0.5% glucose) and dehydrated through a dilution series of ethanol incubations up to absolute ethanol. Tissues were embedded in Spurr Low-Viscosity Embedding Media (Polysciences Europe) and sliced with a microtome (Ultramikrotom Om U43; Reichert Optische Werke). Agrobacterium strains containing the MRS2-7:GFP or a HDEL:DsRED construct (CITATION) for ER colocalization studies (kindly provided by the cell biology department at the Institut für Zelluläre und Molekulare Botanik, Bonn) were grown overnight in 4 mL Luria-Bertani medium containing the appropriate antibiotics at 28°C to stationary phase. Bacteria were harvested by centrifugation and pellets were resuspended in 2 mL infiltration medium (10 mM MgCl2, 10 mM MES, and 150 μM acetosyringone, pH 5.7) and incubated at 28°C for 3 h. The bacterial suspensions were adjusted to an optical density (OD600) of 1.0 and coinfiltrated into the abaxial spaces of young but fully expanded leaves of 6- to 8-week-old N. benthamiana plants with a needleless syringe. Infiltrated leaves were examined after 48 h with an Olympus FV1000 confocal microscope, and serial confocal optical sections were taken. Images were analyzed using the Olympus FV1000 Viewer software. To express the Arabidopsis MRS2/MGT proteins in yeast, an upstream fragment of the yeast MRS2 gene encoding the first 94 amino acids for mitochondrial targeting and the native promoter region was amplified by PCR from the plasmid YEp351-MRS2 (CITATION). The amplified fragment was fused to the respective N-terminally shortened MRS2 coding sequences at the first conserved protein motif (RDLR) of the Arabidopsis MRS2 genes with a single hemagglutinin tag at the C termini by overlap extension PCR and cloned into vector YEp351 (CITATION). Yeast strain DBY mrs2-1 (CITATION) was transformed using the LiOAc/SS Carrier DNA/PEG method (CITATION) and trickled in parallel in a 10-fold serial dilution on normal (YPD) and nonfermentable media (YPdG) to test complementation of the mrs2 growth defect (CITATION). Magnesium uptake was determined via the fluorescent dye mag-fura-2 (Invitrogen) in isolated mitochondria as previously described (CITATION). Accession numbers for protein sequences used for alignment are listed in the following section. Arabidopsis and rice (Oryza sativa) MRS2/MGTprotein sequences were aligned using the CLUSTAL algorithm (gap creation and extension penalties of 10 and 1, respectively) with minor manual adjustments in MEGA (CITATION). Alignments are provided in Supplemental Data Set 1 online. The protein phylogeny was inferred using the neighbor-joining method (CITATION) and Poisson-corrected amino acid distances with MEGA with the pairwise deletion option eliminating indels only in pairwise comparisons.
