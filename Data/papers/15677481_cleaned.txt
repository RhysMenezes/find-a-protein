!~ABS~! Arabidopsis thaliana contains a large number of genes that encode carboxylic acid-activating enzymes, including nine long-chain fatty acyl-CoA synthetases, four 4-coumarate:CoA ligases (4CL), and 25 4CL-like proteins of unknown biochemical function. Because of their high structural and sequence similarity with bona fide 4CLs and their highly hydrophobic putative substrate-binding pockets, the 4CL-like proteins At4g05160 and At5g63380 were selected for detailed analysis. Following heterologous expression, the purified proteins were subjected to a large scale screen to identify their preferred in vitro substrates. This study uncovered a significant activity of At4g05160 with medium-chain fatty acids, medium-chain fatty acids carrying a phenyl substitution, long-chain fatty acids, as well as the jasmonic acid precursors 12-oxo-phytodienoic acid and 3-oxo-2-(2′-pentenyl)-cyclopentane-1-hexanoic acid. The closest homolog of At4g05160, namely At5g63380, showed high activity with long-chain fatty acids and 12-oxo-phytodienoic acid, the latter representing the most efficiently converted substrate. By using fluorescent-tagged variants, we demonstrated that both 4CL-like proteins are targeted to leaf peroxisomes. Collectively, these data demonstrate that At4g05160 and At5g63380 have the capacity to contribute to jasmonic acid biosynthesis by initiating the β-oxidative chain shortening of its precursors. 
!~RES~! Large Scale in Vitro Substrate Analysis of Adenylate-forming Enzymes—In order to identify in vitro substrates of 4CL-like proteins and other carboxylic acid-activating enzymes operating via an adenylate intermediate, we established a sensitive enzyme assay, which allows the analysis of a large number of different compounds in parallel. The common feature of all adenylate-forming enzymes is the activation of their respective substrates at the expense of ATP. Correspondingly, we determined ATP consumption in a semi-quantitative assay based on luciferase-catalyzed light emission in microtiter plate format (Fig. 1A). To establish and optimize the assay conditions, we utilized At4CL2 (wild-type) and the At4CL2 double mutant M293P/K320L, designated PL (37, 46). At4CL2 WT efficiently activates 4-coumaric and caffeic acid to the corresponding CoA esters but exhibits strongly reduced activity toward ferulic and cinnamic acid, whereas the PL mutant readily activates all above-mentioned cinnamic acid derivatives, because of its larger and more hydrophobic SBP. In contrast, both At4CL2 WT and PL are completely inactive toward sinapic acid (37). The results of the optimized luciferase-based assay, as described under “Experimental Procedures,” indeed reflect the known activity profiles of the At4CL2 WT and PL mutant enzymes (Fig. 1B). Essentially, the At4CL2 WT enzyme converted more than 95% of the ATP in mixtures containing 4-coumaric and caffeic acid during a reaction period of 2 h, whereas the PL mutant depleted ATP in mixtures containing all cinnamic acid derivatives except sinapic acid (Fig. 1B). Based on these results, we considered that efficient substrate conversion is indicated by a decrease in ATP concentration by more than 90% within a 2-h incubation period. Among the more than 80 additional potential substrates tested with At4CL2 WT, only 3-(4-hydroxy-phenyl)-propanoic and heptanoic acid were converted with very low efficiency, comparable with the poor substrates cinnamic and ferulic acid, characterizing At4CL2 as a highly selective enzyme (Table I).   [[FIGURE]]  [[TABLE]] When applied to commercially available acetyl-CoA synthetase from yeast (Roche Diagnostics), the luciferase-based assay yielded relative conversion rates of acetic, propionic, and butyric acids, which are consistent with the known properties of the enzyme (not shown). Collectively, these results demonstrate that our assay reliably reflects the properties and activities of different adenylate-forming enzymes. It is noteworthy that only a small aliquot of the reaction mixture (2 μl) was transferred to the luciferase and luciferin-containing buffer (200 μl) and that the determination of light emission was limited to the short period of 10 s. This experimental setup allowed the free variation of assay conditions for the adenylate-forming enzyme to be analyzed, while largely eliminating any interference of assay components on the luciferase-catalyzed reaction. This was an important consideration because firefly luciferase has been demonstrated recently (47) to have the intrinsic capacity to activate long-chain fatty acids. However, conversion of long-chain fatty acids was not observed in control reactions, e.g. with test enzymes omitted from the assays (not shown).  Structural Features of 4CL-like Genes and Proteins from A. thaliana—Phylogenetic analyses revealed that the superfamily of adenylate-forming enzymes present in Arabidopsis segregates into distinct clades, clearly separating the functionally identified 4CL and LACS enzymes (4, 37). Nevertheless, striking similarities were apparent between neighboring clades, for example, when comparing the structures of the Arabidopsis 4CL genes with their closest homologs, genes encoding 4CL-like proteins, which were previously designated as group B enzymes (37). Although the number and size of introns found in At4CL genes vary, their relative positions are conserved, i.e. three introns are found at identical positions in all four genes, whereas At4CL4 and At4CL3 contain one and three additional introns, respectively (Fig. 2A). Genes encoding 4CL-like proteins (group B) contain a similar number of introns (ranging from 3 to 5), and most importantly, these are exclusively located at the same relative positions as in At4CL genes, with the exception of At1g62940, which carries two introns at unique sites near its 5′ end (Fig. 2A). The genes encoding At4g19010, At4g05160, and At5g63380 show the greatest structural similarity with the four At4CL genes. By contrast, no obvious correlation of number and position of introns could be observed between the Arabidopsis 4CL and LACS genes (not shown).   [[FIGURE]] Based on the high sequence identity between Arabidopsis 4CLs and 4CL-like proteins (group B), which ranges from 37 to 44%, and based on the strictly co-linear order of highly conserved domains in both groups of enzymes (Fig. 2A), we considered it reasonable to apply the previously identified 12 amino acid residues comprising the 4CL substrate specificity code to the group B proteins. We identified corresponding amino acids from multiple sequence alignments, and although it was not experimentally established that these residues indeed form the SBPs of 4CL-like proteins, we nonetheless expected to obtain hints for possible substrate preferences by this approach. In Fig. 2B, the phylogenetic relationship between Arabidopsis 4CLs (group A) and 4CL-like proteins (group B) is correlated with the properties of the putative SBP-lining amino acid residues. Two apparent and verifiable predictions arise from this analysis. First, none of the 4CL-like proteins carries a charged residue at position 256, which in At4CL2 (Asn-256) forms a hydrogen bond with the 4-hydroxy group of 4-coumaric acid (37), and correspondingly, none of the 4CL-like proteins is expected to activate 4-hydroxycinnamic acid derivatives. Second, the putative SBPs of two closely related proteins, At4g05160 and At5g63380, are exclusively made up of hydrophobic amino acids (Fig. 2B) and are therefore expected to preferentially bind hydrophobic substrates. We have demonstrated previously that by increasing the hydrophobicity of its SBP, At4CL2 can be converted to a cinnamic acid-activating enzyme (37), and therefore, we hypothesized that a 4CL-like protein with a hydrophobic SBP may represent a cinnamate: CoA ligase.  Two 4CL-like Proteins Function as Fatty Acyl-CoA Synthetases—To verify the hypothesis, cDNAs of both At4g05160 and At5g63380 were cloned from Arabidopsis (Col-0) total leaf mRNA, the encoded proteins were expressed as hexahistidine-tagged fusions in E. coli, and the soluble proteins were purified to apparent homogeneity by affinity chromatography under native conditions (not shown). When tested in the standard photometric 4CL assay, which records the specific absorption of the formed CoA esters, no conversion of cinnamic acid or any of its derivatives was detectable with either protein, suggesting that SBP hydrophobicity and high sequence similarity with At4CLs are insufficient criteria for cinnamic acid binding and activation. To identify true in vitro substrates of At4g05160 and At5g63380, we applied the luciferase-based screening assay with more than 80 candidate substrates comprising cinnamic, benzoic, amino, and fatty acid derivatives. From the results presented in Table I, it is obvious that both proteins have the capacity to activate hydrophobic substrates. Specifically, At4g05160 was active with 4-phenyl-butanoic and 5-phenyl-pentanoic acid, but derivatives having either shorter side chains, e.g. 3-phenyl-propanoic, phenyl-acetic, and benzoic acid, or containing additional polar groups, e.g. 4-(2-hydroxy-4-methoxy-phenyl)-butanoic acid, were not converted. The most efficiently activated substrates, however, were the medium-chain fatty acids, hexanoic and heptanoic acid, as well as the long-chain fatty acids, tetradecanoic (C14:0), hexadecanoic (C16:0), and octadecanoic (C18:0) acid, whereas fatty acids of intermediate chain length (octanoic, nonanoic, decanoic, and dodecanoic acid) were activated only with markedly reduced efficiency (Table I). Subsequent, detailed kinetic analyses revealed that this unusual discontinuous chain length specificity with two apparent activity maxima is because of substrate inhibition by the corresponding C8:0 to C12:0 fatty acids at the concentration applied in the luciferase-based activity assay (results not shown). At5g63380, in comparison to At4g05160, preferentially activated fatty acids with increased chain length (C9:0 to C18:0) and thus shares characteristics with long-chain fatty acyl-CoA synthetases, whereas short-chain fatty acids up to a chain length of C6, as well as phenyl-substituted fatty acids, were converted either poorly or not at all (Table I).  At4g05160 and At5g63380 Have the Capacity to Contribute to JA Biosynthesis—Although At4g05160 and At5g63380 can convert medium- and long-chain fatty acids, we were intrigued by the capacity of at least At4g05160 to also activate fatty acids carrying a bulky phenyl substitution and the fact that both proteins carry putative peroxisomal targeting signals of type 1 (PTS1) at their C termini (Fig. 2A). It is assumed that peroxisomal enzymes are responsible for the conversion of IBA to IAA, as well as OPDA to JA, and that both pathways include β-oxidation steps, which in analogy to fatty acid oxidation should include an activation step of the precursor to the corresponding CoA ester (21, 23, 26, 38). Based on these considerations, we extend our substrate screen. Neither At4g05160 nor At5g63380 catalyzed an appreciable conversion of indole-butyric acid (IBA), indole-propanoic acid, or IAA, indicating that both enzymes do not participate in auxin biosynthesis or metabolism (Table II). In contrast, JA precursors were activated by both enzymes, albeit with different efficiencies. The preferred substrate of At4g05160 was OPC-6:0, whereas At5g63380 converted OPDA most efficiently, which in turn was only a poor substrate for At4g05160 (Table II). Thus, the apparent preference of At4g05160 for substrates with shorter chain length, as observed with fatty acids, obviously extends to JA precursors.   [[TABLE]] In view of the fact that OPDA and OPC-6:0 represent rather unusual substrates for acyl-CoA synthetases and enzymes catalyzing their activation have not previously been described, we wanted to demonstrate unequivocally that the ultimate reaction products are indeed CoA esters and exclude the possibility that the reaction stops at the level of adenylate formation. Enzymes that function solely as long-chain fatty acyl-AMP ligases and have no intrinsic capacity to form a CoA ester end product have recently been identified in Mycobacterium tuberculosis (48). Therefore, we determined the chemical nature of the reaction products formed from OPDA by At5g63380 by using mass spectrometry operating in negative ion mode (Fig. 3). The molecular masses of the product ions m/z 1040.48 and 519.63 were identical, within the experimental error, to the calculated masses of singly and doubly deprotonated OPDA-CoA (Fig. 3B). Both product ions were selected for fragmentation, and in the corresponding MS/MS spectra the majority of ions could be assigned to typical fragments of phosphoadenosine containing compounds (49) and fragments containing OPDA (Fig. 3C). Corresponding results were obtained with OPC-6:0, hexanoic, and nonanoic acid upon incubation with At4g05160 (not shown). In conclusion, compelling evidence was provided that both enzymes, At4g05160 and At5g63380, catalyze the conversion of their substrates to the CoA esters.   [[FIGURE]] Catalytic Efficiency of At4g05160 and At5g63380 —For enzymes accepting multiple substrates, critical assessment of substrate specificity and utilization required detailed kinetic parameters. To establish such data, we applied a quantitative photometric assay, which couples the rate of AMP formation by adenylate-forming enzymes to NADH oxidation via the auxiliary enzymes myokinase, pyruvate kinase, and lactate dehydrogenase (42). For both 4CL-like proteins the kinetic parameters (Km and kcat) were determined for two medium-chain (C6:0, C9:0) and one long-chain fatty acid (C14:0), as well as for the JA precursors OPDA and OPC-6:0 (Table III). From the data in Table III, it is evident that At4g05160 functions as fatty acyl-CoA synthetase with a preference for substrates of medium-chain length. With a kcat/Km value of 230.6, nonanoic acid represents the most efficiently converted substrate, but hexanoic (kcat/Km = 16.74) and tetradecanoic acid (kcat/Km = 42.76) were also converted with appreciable efficiency. Both OPDA and OPC-6:0 have comparable but significantly lower kcat/Km values than the fatty acids used in this analysis (Table III).   [[TABLE]] In the case of At5g63380, the efficiency of fatty acid activation increases continuously with their chain length, with kcat/Km values of 0.44, 9.35, and 57.19 for hexanoic, nonanoic, and tetradecanoic acid, respectively, resulting in a preliminary classification of this enzyme as LACS. In fact, the activity of both At5g63380 as well as At4g05160 with long-chain fatty acids compares favorably with those of other LACS enzymes of plant origin (4, 10, 12, 50). However, the low Km of 11 μm and the high kcat/Km value of 237.9 determined for OPDA (Table II) justify the classification of At5g63380 as a bona fide OPDA: CoA ligase. In contrast to At4g05160, the activity of At5g63380 with OPC-6:0 was too low to allow a reliable determination of kinetic parameters. In agreement with the data presented in Table I, activation of fatty acids by At4CL2 was not detectable.  Expression Level and Subcellular Localization of At4g05160 and At5g63380 —Because JA is synthesized from OPDA or dinor-OPDA in peroxisomes, enzymes contributing to this conversion must be expressed at reasonable levels and targeted to this organelle. To verify whether or not At4g05160 and At5g63380 fulfil both of these criteria, we analyzed their expression and subcellular localization. Steady state mRNA levels of At4g05160 and At5g63380 in Arabidopsis leaves were considerably higher than those of all other members of group B proteins, except At1g20510 and At1g20490, reaching 20–60% of the expression level exhibited by At4CL1 (Fig. 4). At4CL1 has been shown previously (6) to represent the most abundant 4CL isoform in leaves. Although mRNA levels need not necessarily correlate with protein abundance, we conclude that At4g05160 and At5g63380 are presumably of functional importance. The expression of At4g05160 and At5g63380 in other plant organs was determined by semi-quantitative RT-PCR. The results revealed that both genes are co-expressed and that leaves, stems, and flowers contained comparable mRNA amounts, whereas those in roots and siliques were significantly lower (results not shown).   [[FIGURE]] It its known that jasmonates induce the expression of genes encoding enzymes of JA biosynthesis such as lipoxygenase, allene oxide synthase, allene-oxide cyclase-2, and OPR-3 (28). To explore whether At4g05160 and At5g63380 are also part of this proposed positive feedback regulatory system, we analyzed their expression in cultured Arabidopsis cells in response to MeJA treatment. As is obvious from Fig. 5, the amount of At4g05160 mRNA increased strongly and transiently under these conditions, although with a delay in comparison to allene oxide synthase mRNA accumulation, whereas the expression At5g63380 was not affected by MeJA treatment.   [[FIGURE]] When inspecting the N-terminal regions of At4g05160 and At5g63380 for subcellular targeting signal sequences, no such peptide motifs were identified. However, both proteins possess major peroxisomal targeting signals of type 1 (PTS1) at their C termini (Fig. 2A). To demonstrate that the C-terminal tripeptides present in At4g05160 (-SKM) and At5g63380 (-SKL) in fact target their enzymes to peroxisomes, we constructed fusion proteins containing spectral variants of the green fluorescent protein and used these for transient expression and double labeling experiments. RFP extended by the canonical major PTS1 tripeptide -SRL (RFP-SRL) was used as peroxisomal marker protein, because a corresponding green fluorescent protein variant has been shown previously (51–54) to be successfully targeted to the organelle in yeast, mammalian, and plant cells. The complete coding sequences of At4g05160 or At5g63380 were fused to the C terminus of YFP, and all constructs placed under the control of the cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter (Fig. 6A). For co-localization studies, Arabidopsis leaves were biolistically transformed with RFP-SRL and YFP-At4g05160 or YFP-At5g63380, and after a 36-h post-bombardment period, single cells inspected by confocal laser-scanning microscopy. Transformed cells showed a punctate labeling pattern, which is characteristic for peroxisomes (Fig. 6). The complete three-dimensional co-localization of yellow and red fluorescence, originating from YFP-At4g05160/YFP-At5g63380 and RFP-SRL, respectively, provides compelling evidence that both At4g05160 and At5g63380 are localized in peroxisomes (Fig. 6, C and F), i.e. in the organelle that is responsible for fatty acid β-oxidation and the final steps of JA biosynthesis.   [[FIGURE]]
!~MM~! Isolation and Cloning of At4g05160 and At5g63380 cDNAs—The cDNAs of At4g05160 and At5g63380 were amplified by RT-PCR from A. thaliana (Col-0) total RNA. Synthesis of the cDNAs and subsequent PCR amplification of the full-length reading frames was performed with the Titan® one tube RT-PCR kit (Roche Diagnostics) according to the manufacturer's instructions with the primer pair At4g05160-FI and -RI (ATGGAGAAATCCGGCTACGGCAGAGACG and TCACATCTTGGATCTTACTTGCTGAACAAG) and the primer pair At5g63380-FI and -RI (ATGCTGACGAAAACCAACGACAGC and TCAAAGTTTTGATGCATTGCCATCCAC), respectively. The resulting cDNAs were used as templates for a second round of PCR amplification using the primer pair At4g05160-FII and -RII (ATCTTAACAAGCATGCCGAAATCCGGCTACGGCAGAGACGGAATTTAC and TATTAATTAGTCGACTCACATCTTGGATCTTACTTGCTGAACAAGTTC) and the primer pair At5g63380-FII and -RII (TTAAATGGATCCATGCTGACGAAAACCAACGACAGCCG and AATTAAGTCGACTCAAAGTTTTGATGCATTGCCATCCACAGC), respectively. In the case of At4g05160, this second PCR amplification was used to introduce the SphI and SalI sites required for cloning into the expression vector pQE32 (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). In case of At5g63380, BamHI and SalI sites were introduced in the second round of PCR amplification, and the resulting product was cloned into the expression plasmid pQE30 (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). The DNA sequences of all isolated clones were determined by the ADIS service unit (Max Planck Institute for Plant Breeding Research, Köln, Germany) on ABI PRISM377 DNA sequencers (PE Applied Biosystems, Foster City) by using BigDye Terminator chemistry and were found to be identical with the sequences available from the MIPS data base (Munich Information Center for Protein Sequences, Neuherberg, Germany).  Heterologous Expression and Purification of At4g05160 and At5g63380 —Expression and purification of At4g05160 and At5g63380 were essentially carried out as described previously for At4CL2 (2), with the exception that the expression plasmids were introduced into the Escherichia coli strain DH5α carrying the repressor plasmid pREP4 (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) and that the growth temperature was reduced to 25 °C. The purity of the enzymes was inspected by SDS gel electrophoresis. Protein concentrations were determined according to Bradford (39) with bovine serum albumin as standard.  4CL-catalyzed Synthesis of CoA Esters—4CL activity was determined by the spectrophotometric assay described previously (6) with standard concentrations of the cinnamic acid derivative (0.2 mm), ATP (5.5 mm), and CoA (0.3 mm). The specific increase of absorbance during CoA ester formation was monitored at wavelengths of 311, 333, 363, 345, and 352 nm for cinnamoyl-CoA, 4-coumaroyl-CoA, caffeoyl-CoA, feruloyl-CoA, and sinapoyl-CoA, respectively, and the appropriate molar extinction coefficients were used for calculating activity (40, 41).  Luciferase-based Assay of Adenylate-forming Enzymes—To screen a large number of carboxylic acids for activation by 4CL and 4CL-like proteins, the decrease in ATP concentration was determined by a luciferase-coupled assay. The standard reaction mixture contained 2 μg of purified protein, 200 μm carboxylic acid substrate, 50 μm ATP, 250 μm MgCl2, 100 μm CoA, 1 mm dithioerythritol, and 0.1 m Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) in a total volume of 200 μl. Highly lipophilic substrates, such as long-chain fatty acids, were dissolved in buffer containing 2% Triton X-100, leading to a final concentration of 0.1% Triton X-100 in the assay. Jasmonic acid precursors were first dissolved in EtOH and subsequently diluted with detergent-containing buffer, leading to final concentrations of 0.1% EtOH and 0.1% Triton X-100 in the assay. The reaction mixtures were incubated at room temperature, and for ATP determination, 2-μl samples were withdrawn at various time points and added to a reaction mixture containing 1 μg of firefly luciferase (Roche Diagnostics), 4.6 μg of luciferin (Roche Diagnostics), and 0.1 m Tris-HCl (pH 7.8) in total volume of 200 μl. Photon emission was measured for 10 s with a Lumat LB 9501 luminometer (Berthold Technologies, Bad Wildbad, Germany) and expressed as relative luciferase activity, which is directly proportional to ATP concentration. To minimize the variability of the assay, all ATP determinations were normalized to a reaction containing At4CL2 and sinapic acid, in which no ATP depletion occurred and correspondingly was set to 100%. Time course experiments using At4CL2 showed that good substrates resulted in significant ATP depletion within 1–4 h (not shown). Therefore, an incubation period of 2 h was chosen for the large scale screen.  Coupled Enzyme Assay of Acyl-CoA Synthetases—For detailed kinetic analyses, the activation of selected substrates to the corresponding CoA esters by At4g05160 and At5g63380 was followed by measuring AMP formation in a coupled spectrophotometric assay with myokinase, pyruvate kinase, and lactate dehydrogenase adapted from Ziegler et al. (42). The reaction mixture (1 ml) contained 0.1 m Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 2 mm dithioerythritol, 5 mm ATP, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.5 m CoA, 0.1 mm NADH, 1 mm phosphoenolpyruvate, 12 nanokatal of myokinase, 7 nanokatal of pyruvate kinase, 9 nanokatal of lactate dehydrogenase, and 4–1600 μm carboxylic acid substrate. For highly lipophilic substrates 0.1% Triton X-100 was added. The reaction was started by addition of 2–8 μg of purified enzyme and the oxidation of 2 mol of NADH per mol of substrate activated was followed at 340 nm (ϵNADH = 6.22 cm2 μmol-1). Km and Vmax values were obtained by linear regression of V/s against s (Hanes plots) from at least three independent experiments.  Transient Expression and Subcellular Localization of At4g05160 and At5g63380 in Planta—At4g05160 and At5g63380 cDNAs were PCR-amplified using the primer pair attB1-05160 and attB2-05160 (attB1-TCATGGAGAAATCCGGCTACGG and attB2-CTCACATCTTGGATCTTAGTTGC) and the primer pair attB1-63380 and attB2-63380 (attB1-TCATGCTGACGAAAACCAACG and attB2-CTCAAAGTTTTGATGCATTGCC), respectively, thereby making the PCR products compatible with the Gateway® cloning system (Invitrogen). Both modified cDNAs were inserted into the Gateway donor vector pDONR201 by homologous recombination according to the manufacturer's instructions. The resulting plasmids were used to transfer both coding sequences into the expression vector pENSGYFP, which is based on pXCS (GenBank™ accession number AY457636) and was kindly provided by Dr. N. Medina-Escobar (Max Planck Institute for Plant Breeding Research, Köln, Germany), leading to N-terminal fusions of YFP to At4g05160 and At5g63380. To serve as peroxisomal marker, the red fluorescent protein, dsRED (FP583 from Discosoma sp.), with the peroxisomal import sequence -SRL fused to its C terminus (kindly provided by M. Miklis, Max Planck Institute for Plant Breeding Research, Köln, Germany) was cloned via HindIII and EcoRI restriction sites into the plant binary expression vector pAMPAT-MCS (GenBank™ accession number AY436765). All newly designed vectors allowed the in planta expression of proteins under the control of the constitutive cauliflower mosaic virus double 35S promoter. For transient in planta expression, detached leaves of 4-week-old A. thaliana (Col-0) plants were placed on 1% agar plates containing 85 μm benzimidazole and bombarded with 1 μm gold particles coated with vector DNA using the Biolistic® PDS-1000/He Particle Delivery System (Bio-Rad). Preparation of the DNA-coated gold beads was performed as suggested by the manufacturer. Each macrocarrier was loaded with 6 μl of the gold particle suspension, and the transformation was carried out as described previously (43). Bombarded leaves were placed in a growth chamber for 36 h, and subsequent fluorescence microscopy was carried out by using an LSM 510 Meta confocal laser microscope (Carl Zeiss, Jena, Germany). An argon laser was used as excitation source (514 nm), and light emission was detected in the range of 570–634 nm for RFP constructs and 535–545 nm for YFP constructs. Images were recorded and processed by using LSM 510 3.2 software (Carl Zeiss, Jena, Germany).  Mass Spectrometric Analysis—For the identification of the CoA ester products formed from various substrates, the reaction mixture contained 2 μg of purified enzyme, 1 mm carboxylic acid substrate, 1 mm ATP, 1 mm CoA, 30 mm NH4HCO3, and 0.1% Triton X-100. After an incubation period of 60 min, the samples were diluted with equal volumes of acetonitrile, and 2-μl aliquots were applied to Au/Pd-coated borosilicate glass capillary type medium (Proxeon Biosystems, Odense, Denmark). Mass spectra were recorded with a Micromass Q-TOF 2™ spectrometer (Waters) equipped with a nanoelectrospray ionization source and operating in negative ion mode. Capillary voltage was set at 800 V and cone voltage at 40 V. Full-scan mass spectra were obtained by scanning from m/z 0 to 1500. Putative product peaks were further characterized by MS/MS analysis using argon as collision gas and a collision voltage of 30 V. Data processing was carried out using the MassLynx software (version 3.5) from Micromass (Waters).  RNA Preparation and Collection of Gene Expression Data—A. thaliana plants were grown in soil in a growth chamber under controlled conditions with the photoperiod set to 10 h of light (180 μEm-2 s-1) and 14 h of dark, a temperature of 22–23 °C, and a relative humidity of 65%. Total RNA was extracted from fully developed leaves of 4-week-old plants using RNAwiz (Ambion, Austin, Texas) according to the manufacturer's instructions. cRNA labeling, hybridization to the GeneChip ATH-1 (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA), and collection of fluorescence data were performed as recommended by the manufacturer. The expression value of the gene chip was scaled globally to the value of 500 arbitrary florescence units and the background set to 46.65 arbitrary florescence units.  The Arabidopsis cell culture At7 (derived from ecotype Columbia) was grown as described previously (44). Five days after sub-culturing, 4 mg of methyl jasmonate (MeJA; Sigma) dissolved in 0.1 ml of ethanol was added to 40 ml of cell culture. After the indicated times of incubation, cells were harvested by filtration and frozen in liquid nitrogen. Total RNA was isolated from 300 mg of cells using the RNeasy plant mini kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany), denatured, separated on 1.2% agarose-formaldehyde gels, transferred to nylon membranes (Biodyne B; Pall Life Sciences, New York), and hybridized with radiolabeled DNA probes as described previously (43). Equal loading was monitored by ethidium bromide staining of the gel. For semi-quantitative RT-PCR analysis, cDNA was prepared using the SuperScript cDNA synthesis kit (Invitrogen) and amplified with gene-specific primer pairs for At4g05160 (TGGAGAAATCCGGCTACGG and ATTCCATATCCCTGCATAAGC) and At5g63380 (TGACGAAAACCAACGACAGC and CGGTGGAACCTGATAAGCC) both spanning exon-intron junctions, thereby excluding amplification of contaminating genomic DNA. Product formation was monitored after 20, 25, 30, and 35 PCR cycles by agarose gel electrophoresis. The Arabidopsis actin 2 gene (At3g18780) served as internal control.  Synthesis of Jasmonic Acid Precursors—OPCs were obtained as described previously (34). OPDA and dinor-OPDA were prepared from α-linolenic acid and (7Z,10Z,13Z)-hexadeca-7,10,13-trienoic acid, respectively, by a flaxseed extract according to Ref. 45, purified by reversed phase-high pressure liquid chromatography, and checked for purity by gas chromatography-MS. (7Z,10Z,13Z)-Hexadeca-7,10,13-trienoic acid could be obtained by alkaline saponification of a lipid extract from tomato leaves and separation of the 16:3 fatty acids reversed phase-high pressure liquid chromatography. All compounds represent mixtures of stereoisomers, which were used without further separation.
