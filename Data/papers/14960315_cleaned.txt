!~ABS~! Precise regulation of calcium transporters is essential for modulating the Ca 2+ signaling network that is involved in the growth and adaptation of all organisms. The Arabidopsis H + /Ca 2+ antiporter, CAX1, is a high capacity and low affinity Ca 2+ transporter and several CAX1-like transporters are found in Arabidopsis . When heterologously expressed in yeast, CAX1 is unable to suppress the Ca 2+ hypersensitivity of yeast vacuolar Ca 2+ transporter mutants due to an N-terminal autoinhibition mechanism that prevents Ca 2+ transport. Using a yeast screen, we have identified C A X i nteracting p rotein 4 (CXIP4) that activated full-length CAX1, but not full-length CAX2, CAX3 or CAX4. CXIP4 encodes a novel plant protein with no bacterial, fungal, animal, or mammalian homologs. Expression of a GFP-CXIP4 fusion in yeast and plant cells suggests that CXIP4 is targeted predominantly to the nucleus. Using a yeast growth assay, CXIP4 activated a chimeric CAX construct that contained specific portions of the N-terminus of CAX1. Together with other recent studies, these results suggest that CAX1 is regulated by several signaling molecules that converge on the N-terminus of CAX1 to regulate H + /Ca 2+ antiport.
!~RES~! In a previous study, using a yeast expression Arabidopsis cDNA library [BIB27] , we identified and isolated several Arabidopsis cDNAs that allow the full-length CAX1-expressing K667 ( pmc1 cnb1 vcx1 ) yeast strain, which is hypersensitive to high Ca 2+ , to grow in media containing high levels of Ca 2+ [BIB20 BIB21] . We named the protein products of these cDNAs C A X i nteracting p roteins (CXIP). In this screen, four out of the six cDNA clones isolated were identical and encode a protein whose function has not been previously elucidated in any organism. We have termed this gene CXIP4 . The CXIP4 cDNA consists of 999 base pairs (GenBank™ accession number AY163162 ). Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) searches against genome and EST databases revealed that CXIP4 is a novel plant gene with no homologs in bacteria, fungi, animals and mammals. CXIP4 has homologs in other plant species, including rice, wheat, barley, tomato, grape, sunflower, and Medicago truncatula , suggesting that the CXIP4 gene is specifically expressed in plants ( [FIG1] ). CXIP4 encodes a protein that consists of 332 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of 37.8 kDa. Analysis of the amino acid composition of the CXIP4 polypeptide found that CXIP4 is rich in the following residues: Arg (15.1%), Lys (11.1%) Glu (11.7%) and Ser (15.4%). A search for specific functional motifs by using the MotifScan program revealed that there is a single zinc finger CCHC motif at the N-terminal region and also an arginine-rich region located at the C-terminus of CXIP4 ( [FIG1] ). A PSORT program to predict the organelle-targeting signals revealed that CXIP4 has multiple nuclear-targeting signatures, which are located in the C-terminus. In addition, the TargetP program [BIB28] assigned a score of 0.83 for mitochondrial localization, suggesting that CXIP4 might target to mitochondria in vivo. To verify the ability of CXIP4 to activate CAX1 Ca 2+ transport activity, a yeast growth assay was performed as previously described [BIB20] . Expression of CXIP4 or full-length CAX1 alone did not suppress the Ca 2+ hypersensitivity of the yeast vacuolar Ca 2+ transport defect mutant (K667), whereas K667 coexpressing CXIP4+CAX1 could grow on 200 mM CaCl 2 in a similar manner to the yeast cells expressing N-terminally truncated CAX1 (sCAX1, [FIG2] ). This result supports the hypothesis that activation of CAX1 by CXIP4 mediated H + /Ca 2+ antiport activity in yeast. To directly test this hypothesis, we measured ΔpH-dependent 10 μM 45 CaCl 2 uptake into microsomal vesicles isolated from K667 yeast strains expressing sCAX1, CAX1+CXIP4, CAX1 or CXIP4 alone. H + /Ca 2+ transport activity was observed in membrane vesicles from a CAX1+CXIP4-expressing strain and a sCAX1-expressing strain ( [FIG2] ). However, no H + /Ca 2+ antiport activity was detectable in vesicles from full-length CAX1-expressing or CXIP4-expressing yeast strains ( [FIG2] , data not shown). The H + /Ca 2+ antiport activity measured from CXIP4+CAX1 vesicles was not high, about 10±1.5% of the activity measured from sCAX1 vesicles, but significantly meaningful compared with CAX1 alone. Given that expression of other full-length Arabidopsis CAX transporters does not suppress yeast mutants deficient in vacuolar Ca 2+ transport ( [BIB11 BIB12 BIB13] ; Pittman et al., unpublished), we were interested in the specificity of CXIP4+CAX activation. As shown in [FIG2] , CXIP4 was unable to activate full-length CAX2, CAX3 and CAX4. CXIP4 specifically activated CAX1. Given that CAX3 is 93% similar to CAX1 [BIB11] , we were interested in determining the domains or regions within CAX1 required for CXIP4 activation. In a previous study, a series of CAX1/CAX3 chimeras were created to determine the structural determinant required for Ca 2+ transport [BIB23] . In those chimeras, both CAX1 and CAX3 lack the first 36 amino acids that appear to be required to negatively regulate antiport activity. An N-terminal truncation of CAX3 (sCAX3), like full-length CAX3, was still unable to suppress the vacuolar Ca 2+ transport deficiency despite lacking its autoinhibitory domain ( [BIB23] , [FIG3] ). In addition, sCAX3 coexpressed with CXIP4 was unable to suppress the yeast Ca 2+ sensitivity ( [FIG3] ). As shown in [FIG3] , yeast cells expressing numerous sCAX3/CAX1 proteins+CXIP4 were unable to suppress the Ca 2+ sensitivity of K667 yeast. For example, K667 strains in which CXIP4 was coexpressed with sCAX3/CAX1 chimeric proteins that contained the central region or C-terminus of CAX1 were unable to suppress the Ca 2+ -sensitive phenotype. However, when a chimeric protein (called sCAX3-α1) was used that contained 37 amino acids of the N-terminal region of CAX1 (Met 37 to Leu 73 ) fused to CAX3, CXIP4 could activate this chimeric protein, suggesting that this region in CAX1 is required for CXIP4 to activate CAX1. It was demonstrated that specific amino acids residues within the N-terminus of CAX1 are critical for autoinhibition [BIB9] . For example, when serine-25 was changed to aspartic acid (D) and when the threonine-33 residue was changed to any other amino acid such as alanine (A) or glutamic acid (E), CAX1 was no longer autoinhibited and H + /Ca 2+ transport could occur. In contrast, other single or double point mutations within the CAX1 N-terminus did not alter CAX1 autoinhibition [BIB9] . To test if CXIP4 could allow autoinhibited CAX1 mutants to suppress the Ca 2+ sensitive phenotypes, we expressed CXIP4 in yeast strains expressing these CAX1 mutants. As shown in [FIG4] , some CAX1 mutants, such as CAX1-S25A, CAX1-S25T and CAX1-E7A/E13A, remained autoinhibited in the presence of CXIP4. However, other CAX1 single or double point mutants that retain autoinhibition were activated following coexpression with CXIP4. CXIP4 did not appear to alter the activity of any of the deregulated CAX1 constructs, such as the single point mutants CAX1-S25D, CAX1-T33A or the double point mutant CAX1-R29A/R32A, as these all remained active following CXIP4 expression (data not shown). To examine expression of CXIP4 , total RNA from various tissues from mature Arabidopsis plants was used for RNA gel blot analysis. As shown in [FIG5] , CXIP4 was expressed in all tissues with highly abundant expression found in leaves, stems, and roots, but slightly lower expression in flowering tissue. To determine how CXIP4 is expressed in response to ion stresses, 3-week-old seedlings were treated with various metal ions. The CXIP4 RNA transcript levels were modestly increased when Ca 2+ was added to the medium, while the CXIP4 RNA levels did not change when seedlings were exposed to Na + , Mn 2+ or Ni 2+ , compared to control seedlings treated with H 2 O or Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium. Interestingly, CXIP4 expression was reduced upon ZnCl 2 treatment ( [FIG5] ). To investigate the subcellular localization of the CXIP4 protein, we constructed an N-terminal GFP fusion with CXIP4 and expressed this in yeast cells under the control of the yeast glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase promoter and in tobacco leaves or BY-2 cells under the control of a CaMV 35S promoter. When GFP-CXIP4 was coexpressed with CAX1 in the yeast mutant strain, K667, the yeast cells were able to suppress the Ca 2+ -sensitive phenotype, suggesting that the fusion protein remained functional (data not shown). The localization of the fusion protein in these yeast cells was observed predominantly in the nucleus, but we also saw specific microdomains in the cytosol where the fusion protein is localized ( [FIG6] ). Consistent with the result from yeast cells, the GFP-CXIP4 transiently expressed in tobacco BY-2 cells was predominately located in nuclei, which were visualized with propidium iodide staining ( [FIG6] ). The GFP-CXIP4 was also transiently expressed in tobacco leaves and the fusion protein was again located in the nuclei of leaf epidermal, mesophyll and trichome cells (data not shown). Interestingly, in leaf epidermal cells, the GFP-CXIP4 was observed in both nuclei and the cytoplasm ( [FIG6] ). Apparently, those green fluorescent fusion proteins are located in discrete areas of the cytoplasm; however, they are not colocalized with the mitochondria ( [FIG6] ).
!~MM~! S. cerevisiae strain K667 ( MATa cnb1::LEU1 pmc1::TRP1 vcx1 Δ ade2-1 , can1-100 , his3-11 , 15leu2-3 , 112trp1-1 and ura3-1 ) [BIB17] was used in all yeast experiments involving the expression of CAX genes with or without CXIP4 . A. thaliana Columbia ecotype and Nicotiana tabacum ‘Xanthi’ and BY-2 cell line [BIB22] were used in this study. Yeast cells expressing CAX transporters (CAX1, CAX2, CAX3, CAX4, chimeric CAX constructs or CAX1 mutants) were transformed with CXIP4 as described previously [BIB20] . Stable transformants were assayed on YPD (yeast extract/peptone/dextrose) medium supplemented with 200 mM CaCl 2 [BIB8 BIB23] . Some yeast strain colonies had different colors when grown on Ca 2+ -containing media and YPD medium. We found this in all our yeast growth assays. However, we have never documented that these yeast cells with different colors have changed their calcium transport properties (or other phenotypes). CAX chimeric constructs (sCAX3-β, sCAX3-γ, sCAX3-δ, sCAX1-α and sCAX3-α1) and CAX1 variants were previously described [BIB9 BIB23] . Microsomal membrane-enriched vesicles were isolated from yeast as described previously [BIB9] . Time-dependent H + /Ca 2+ transport into endomembrane vesicles was examined using the direct filtration method [BIB8] . RNA sample preparation and Northern blot analysis were performed as previously described [BIB7 BIB20] . To fuse the GFP to the N-terminus of CXIP4, the eGFP (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA, USA) gene was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using the following primer sets. Forward primer: 5′-CGG CTC GAG CCA TGG TGA GCA AGG GCG-3′; reverse primer: 5′-AGG ACT GGA TCC GCC CTT GTA CAG CTC GTC CAT-3′. Xho I and Bam HI sites (underlined) were introduced for subsequent cloning sites. The eGFP gene fragment without stop codon was cloned into Xho I/ Bam HI sites of pBluescript KS (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA, USA), resulting in pKS-eGFP. The CXIP4 gene was amplified by PCR using the following primer sets. Forward primer: 5′-GCC GGA TCC ATG CCG CGC ACA GCA GGA AGA-3′; reverse primer: 5′-GGG AGC T CT CGA G TC GAC CTA CTC TCG CTC TTT CCT GTG-3′. Bam HI and Sac I sites (underlined) were introduced for subsequent cloning sites. The CXIP4 gene fragment was cloned into the Bam HI/ Sac I sites of pKS-eGFP, resulting in pKS-GFP-CXIP4. The fusion construct was completely sequenced to confirm no PCR errors. The fusion protein product would have three amino acid residues added between GFP and CXIP4 due to the introduction of the Bam HI site. To express the fusion protein in the yeast cells and plants, the GFP-CXIP4 was subcloned into yeast expression vector piUGpd [BIB24] and the plant transient expression vector pRTL2 [BIB25] . The plasmid DNA of piUGpd-GFP-CXIP4 was used to transform the yeast strain K667 and selected on −Ura medium. Stable transformants were grown in the same selection medium and the expression of the fusion protein was examined by confocal microscopy [BIB12] . The plasmid DNA of pRTL2-GFP-CXIP4 was delivered into tobacco leaves or BY-2 cells by Biolistic Particle Delivery System (model PDS-1000, Dupont, DE, USA) as previously described [BIB26] . For visualization of nuclei or mitochondria, the bombarded BY-2 cells were briefly fixed with 2% (v/v) formaldehyde in PME (50 mM PIPES, 4 mM MgSO 4 , and 10 mM EGTA) buffer at 8–12 h post bombardment for 1–5 min and then stained with 0.1% propidium iodide (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA) or Mito-Tracker (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR, USA) for 5 min. The transient expression and subcellular localization of the fusion protein and nuclei or mitochondria were observed by confocal microscopy (model 1024ES, Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA). The green channel (excitation at 488 nm, emission at 522 nm, and barrier filter at 522–535 nm) and red channel (excitation at 568 nm, emission at 598 nm, and barrier filter at 605–632 nm) were scanned separately to avoid cross-contamination and then merged using Lasersharp 3.1 software provided by the manufacturer (Bio-Rad). The confocal images were processed using Adobe Photoshop software (version 6.0; Adobe Systems, San Jose, CA, USA).
