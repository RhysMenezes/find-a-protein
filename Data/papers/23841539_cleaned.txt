!~ABS~! Type II NAD(PH) dehydrogenases are located on the inner mitochondrial membrane of plants, fungi, protists and some primitive animals. However, recent observations have been made which identify several Arabidopsis type II dehydrogenases as dual targeted proteins. Targeting either mitochondria and peroxisomes or mitochondria and chloroplasts. Members of the ND protein family were identified in various plant species. Phylogenetic analyses and subcellular targeting predictions were carried out for all proteins. All ND proteins from three model plant species Arabidopsis, rice and Physcomitrella were cloned as N- and C-terminal GFP fusions and subcellular localisations were determined. Dual targeting of plant type II dehydrogenases was observed to have evolved early in plant evolution and to be widespread throughout different plant species. In all three species tested dual targeting to both mitochondria and peroxisomes was found for at least one NDA and NDB type protein. In addition two NDB type proteins from Physcomitrella were also found to target chloroplasts. The dual targeting of NDC type proteins was found to have evolved later in plant evolution. The functions of type II dehydrogenases within plant cells will have to be re-evaluated in light of this newly identified subcellular targeting information.
!~RES~! Previously, we had determined that a number of ND proteins from Arabidopsis thaliana are dual targeted to several locations including: mitochondria and peroxisomes or mitochondria and plastids [[B25]]. To gain a better understanding of how widespread this dual targeting ability is, we identified all the ND type proteins from a number of plant species, utilised various subcellular prediction programs for each ortholog and identified any peroxisomal type 1 targeting sequences (PTS1) according to several prediction programs [[B29],[B30]] and the AraPerox database [[B31]] (Figure [F1] and Additional file [S2]). Phylogenetic analysis showed that all ND orthologs are clustered into three distinct clades (Figure [F1]). Types A, B and C (colored in green, red and blue respectively). It was found that A type ND proteins (in green) are predominantly predicted to be targeted to the mitochondria and is consistent with the previous data from Arabidopsis in which both NDA1 and 2 have cleavable mitochondrial N-terminal targeting signals [[B23]]. However, it was interesting that at least one NDA ortholog from each higher plant species appears to have a PTS1 signal at their C-terminus. None of the prediction programs used predicted peroxisomal targeting for any of the NDA proteins from Physcomitrella (Pp) or Chlamydomonas (Cr). Phylogenetic and subcellular predictions of plant NAD(P)H dehydrogenases. Phylogenetic tree of NAD(P)H dehydrogenases from Vovox carteri (Vc), Chlamydomonas reinhardtii (Cr), Physcomitrella patens (Pp), Selaginella moellendorffii (Sm), Oryza sativa (Os), Zea mays (Zm), Vitis vinifera (Vv), Arabidopsis thaliana (At), Glycine Max (Gm), Picea glauca (Pg) and Populus trichocarpa (Pt). The sequences of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Sc) NAD(P)H dehydrogenases are included as well as NADH dehydrogenases from Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 (Synechocystis) and Escherichia coli (E. coli). The predicted and experimental localizations of each protein (including this study) are indicated by the coloured boxes. Orange = Mitochondrial, Green = Plastid, Blue = Peroxisomal and Black = no prediction. Shown also are the last 12 amino acids (chosen because the PTS1 predictor uses the last 12 amino acids), putative peroxisomal targeting signals (PTS1) are coloured depending on the strength as determined by the AraPerox database (dark blue - major PTS1, light blue - minor PTS1 and pink - rare PTS1). The known experimental loactions for Arabidopsis thaliana ND proteins were taken from [[B23],[B25]], for Chlamydomonas reinhardtii NDA1 and NDA2 from [[B32]-[B34]] and for Saccharomyces cerevisiae Ndi1, Nde1 and Nde2 from [[B35]]. The phylogenetic tree was constructed using the neighboring-joining method. Numbers at each node are the percentage bootstrap values of 1000 replicates. The scale bar indicates the number of amino acid substitutions at each site. Amongst the NDB type proteins, prediction of mitochondrial targeting was less frequent (Figure [F1] and Additional file [S2]). This may be due to the fact that NDB proteins do not contain a cleavable N-terminus mitochondrial targeting signal which is the basis of the prediction programs used [[B23]]. However, the majority (22 out of 29) of NDB proteins, ranging from Physcomitrella to Poplar also contain predicted PTS1 sequences. It is interesting to note that the predicted PTS1 sequences in both NDA and NDB proteins are not conserved in all species. In fact, in different species the PTS1 sequence is completely different in terms of the amino acids making up the last C-terminal tripeptide; however, the properties remain the same. This suggests that the C-terminal regions of NDA and NDB proteins is not crucial for catalytic function. The NDC type proteins, so named for their similarity to a cyanobacterial NADH dehydrogenase, and are mostly predicted to be targeted to plastids [[B22]] (Figure [F1]). No PTS1 sequences were predicted. This is consistent with the localisation of Arabidopsis NDC1, which is predicted to be plastidial but has been experimentally shown to be targeted to both mitochondria and plastids [[B25],[B26]]. It has previously been shown that both NDA proteins from Arabidopsis (AtNDA1 and AtNDA2) are dual targeted to mitochondria and peroxisomes by both GFP-tagging and western blot analysis [[B25]]. To demonstrate the fluorescence patterns expected by a dual targeted protein containing an N-terminal mitochondrial targeting signal and a C-terminal PTS1 sequence we have included the Arabidopsis proteins in our analysis of the rice and Physcomitrella NDA orthologs. When GFP is placed at the C-terminus of both AtNDA1 and 2, the chimeric protein is targeted to mitochondria in both Arabidopsis cell suspension and onion epidermal cells (Figure [F2]) as visualized by the overlap of the GFP with the RFP signals from the mitochondrial controls. In most instances the GFP signal shows a halo-like shape around the mitochondria. This has been speculated to result when the GFP is not completely pulled into the mitochondria and has previously been observed with AtNDA and AtNDB proteins [[B25]] and is also observed with the GFP tagging of mitochondrial outer membrane proteins [[B36]]. However in this case, as NDA proteins are known to be located in the inner membrane, it is possible that the C-terminus of NDA proteins are located in the intermembrane space (IMS) and may produce a similar result [[B4]]. In contrast to the full-length C-terminal fusions, truncation of both AtNDA1 and AtNDA2 to just the final 10 amino acids fused to the C-terminus of GFP (10 amino acids were chosen to be consistent with previous research on ND targeting in Arabidopsis as well to be consistent with previous work on the targeting of peroxisomal proteins which also used the last 10 amino acids), was found to target solely to the peroxisomes (Figure [F2]). This co-localization was observed in both tissue types tested. Subcellular localizations of Arabidopsis and rice NDA type proteins. GFP was fused to the C-terminus of NDA1 and NDA2 from Arabidopsis thaliana (At) and NDA1 and NDA2 from Oryza sativa (Os). Additionally, the last 10 amino acids were fused to the C-terminus of GFP. Subcellular targeting was analyzed in both Arabidopsis cell suspension or onion epidermal tissue along with RFP tagged mitochondrial or peroxisomal controls. The protein accession number, the location of GFP and the number of amino acids used are shown for each construct. Mitochondria (M) and peroxisomes (Px) are indicated. M-RFP - mitochondrial RFP, Px-RFP - peroxisomal RFP. Scale bar indicates 10 μm. When both NDA proteins from rice (OsNDA1 and 2) were analysed in the same manner, slightly different results were obtained. OsNDA1 was observed to target to mitochondria when GFP was fused to its C-terminus (Figure [F2]), however when the last 10 amino acids are fused to the C-terminus of GFP, no targeting was observed to any distinct organelle (Figure [F2]), consistent with the fact that OsNDA1 does not contain a predicted PTS1 signal. When the targeting of OsNDA2 was tested it was seen to target to both mitochondria and peroxisomes in both the tissues tested (Figure [F2]). Therefore, at least one of the rice NDA proteins displays dual targeting ability. To determine if dual targeting ability is also evident with Physcomitrella NDA1 and NDA2, the same set of experiments were performed. In both onion epidermal cells and Arabidopsis cell suspension both Physcomitrella NDA proteins (PpNDA1 and PpNDA2) displayed dual targeting ability to both mitochondria and peroxisomes (Figure [F3]) as with AtNDA1, AtNDA2 and OsNDA2. However, based on the bioinfomatic analysis the targeting of PpNDA1 and PpNDA2 to peroxisomes is surprising as they do not contain any PTS1 signal nor are they predicted to be peroxisomal (Figure [F1]). To test whether this peroxisomal targeting is an artifact, we expressed the Physcomitrella NDA fusions in Physcomitrella tissue, thereby eliminating any incorrect targeting arising from cross-species interference. Again, both PpNDA1 and PpNDA2 were dual targeted to mitochondria and peroxisomes (Figure [F3]), suggesting that the dual targeting of NDA type proteins arose early in land plant evolution. Subcellular localizations of Physcomitrella NDA type proteins. GFP was fused to the C-terminus of NDA1 and NDA2 from Physcomitrella patens (Pp). Additionally, the last 10 amino acids were fused at the C-terminus of GFP. Subcellular targeting was analyzed in both Arabidopsis cell suspension, onion epidermal tissue and Physcomitrella protonemal tissue along with RFP tagged mitochondrial or peroxisomal controls. The protein accession number, the location of GFP and the number of amino acids used are shown for each construct. Mitochondria (M) and peroxisomes (Px) are indicated. M-RFP - mitochondrial RFP, Px-RFP - peroxisomal RFP. Scale bar indicates 10 μm. The three Arabidopsis NDB proteins (AtNDB1, AtNDB2 and AtNDB4) have previously been determined to be mitochondrial [[B22],[B25]], which was confirmed in this study (Figure [F4]). However, the last 10 amino acids of AtNDB1 fused to the C-terminus of GFP targeted to peroxisomes, whilst the last 10 amino acids of AtNDB2 and AtNDB4 did not target GFP to any distinct organelle and appeared cytosolic, indicative of no targeting (Figure [F4]). This confirms that AtNDB1 is dual targeted to both mitochondria and peroxisomes and that AtNDB2 and AtNDB4 can only be targeted to mitochondria. To determine if dual targeting of NDB proteins also occurs in rice, the two rice orthologs (OsNDB1 and OsNDB2) were also analysed. Both OsNDB1 and OsNDB2 were observed to target GFP to mitochondria and the last 10 amino acids can target GFP to peroxisomes in all the tissues tested (Figure [F4]). This suggests that the dual targeting of NDB proteins is conserved in rice and Arabidopsis. Subcellular localizations of Arabidopsis and rice NDB type proteins. GFP was fused to the C-terminus of NDB1, NDB2 and NDB4 from Arabidopsis thaliana (At) and NDB1 and NDB2 from Oryza sativa (Os). Additionally, the last 10 amino acids were fused at the C-terminus of GFP. Subcellular targeting was analyzed in both Arabidopsis cell suspension or onion epidermal tissue along with RFP tagged mitochondrial or peroxisomal controls. The protein accession number, the location of GFP and the number of amino acids used are shown for each construct. Mitochondria (M) and peroxisomes (Px) are indicated. M-RFP - mitochondrial RFP, Px-RFP - peroxisomal RFP. Scale bar indicates 10 μm. Unlike rice and Arabidopsis, Physcomitrella contains three NDB homologs (PpNDB1, PpNDB2 and PpNDB3) and when GFP was fused to their C-termini, GFP was targeted to the mitochondria with a distinctive halo-like fluorescence in Arabidopsis cell suspensions (Figure [F5]). However, when these same constructs were expressed in onion epidermal cells a very different picture emerged for PpNDB1 and PpNDB2. Not only were PpNDB1 and PpNDB2 targeted to mitochondria but they could also target GFP to plastids (Figure [F5]). For PpNDB3, only mitochondrial targeting was observed (Figure [F5]). When the last 10 amino acids of PpNDB1, PpNDB2 and PpNDB3 were fused to the C-terminus of GFP, both PpNDB1 and PpNDB2 could target GFP to peroxisomes and PpNDB3 showed targeting of GFP to the cytosol (Figure [F5]). The GFP assays were repeated with Physcomitrella tissue (Figure [F6]) and as seen in the onion epidermal cells and Arabidopsis cell suspensions both PpNDB1 and PpNDB2 were able to target GFP to mitochondria, plastids and peroxisomes (Figure [F6]). PpNDB3 was only observed to target GFP to mitochondria, even in a homologous system (Figure [F6]). The lack of peroxisomal targeting by the C-termini of PpNDB3 is not surprising, as no PTS1 sequence is predicted (Figure [F1]). However, the targeting of PpNDB1 and PpNDB2 to plastids was unexpected. However, they are closely related to the Chlamydomonas NDA2 protein (Figure [F1]), which has been demonstrated to be a solely plastidic protein [[B32],[B33]]. Notably, Physcomitrella NDB proteins are also considerably longer at the N-terminus compared to Arabidopsis (Additional file [S3]), suggesting additional targeting information and as the ambiguous targeting predictor (ATP) predicts both PpNDB1 and PpNDB2 to be dual targeted (Figure [F1] and Additional file [S2]). Subcellular localizations of Physcomitrella NDB type proteins. GFP was fused to the C-terminus of NDB1, NDB2 and NDB4 from Physcomitrella patens (Pp). Additionally, the last 10 amino acids were fused at the C-terminus of GFP. Subcellular targeting was analyzed in both Arabidopsis cell suspension or onion epidermal tissue along with RFP tagged mitochondrial, peroxisomal or plastid controls. The protein accession number, the location of GFP and the number of amino acids used are shown for each construct. Mitochondria (M), Plastids (Pl) and peroxisomes (Px) are indicated. M-RFP - mitochondrial RFP, Px-RFP - peroxisomal RFP, Pl-RFP - platid RFP. Scale bar indicates 10 μm. Subcellular localizations of Physcomitrella NDB type proteins in Physcomitrella tissue. GFP was fused to the C-terminus of NDB1, NDB2 and NDB4 from Physcomitrella patens (Pp). Additionally, the last 10 amino acids were fused at the C-terminus of GFP. Subcellular targeting was analyzed in Physcomitrella protonemal tissue along with RFP tagged mitochondrial, peroxisomal or plastid controls. The protein accession number, the location of GFP and the number of amino acids used are shown for each construct. Mitochondria (M), Plastids (Pl) and peroxisomes (Px) are indicated. M-RFP - mitochondrial RFP, Px-RFP - peroxisomal RFP, Pl-RFP - platid RFP. Scale bar indicates 10 μm. Phylogenetic analysis showed that among the three clades made up of NDA, NDB and NDC proteins, NDC is the most ancestral group and branched out early in evolution. With regard to the targeting ability of NDC proteins, only one ortholog was found in Arabidopsis, rice and Physcomitrella. When Arabidopsis NDC1 (AtNDC1) was fused to GFP and expressed, two different patterns emerged. In Arabidopsis cell suspensions a clear plastidic localization could be observed, however, in onion epidermal cells clear targeting to both mitochondria and plastids was observed (Figure [F7]). As AtNDC1 was previously shown to be imported into isolated Arabidopsis mitochondria [[B23],[B25],[B26]] it can be concluded that AtNDC1 is dual targeted to mitochondria and plastids [[B25],[B26]]. Subcellular localizations of Physcomitrella NDC type proteins. GFP was fused to the C terminus of the NDC type proteins from Arabidopsis thaliana (At), Oryza sativa (Os) and Physcomitrella patens (Pt). Subcellular targeting was analyzed in Arabidopsis cell suspension, onion epidermal tissues and for the Physcomitrella NDC1 also in Physcomitrella protenemal tissue along with RFP tagged mitochondrial or plastid controls The protein accession number, the position of GFP and the number of amino acids used are shown for each construct. Mitochondria (M) and plastids (Pl) are indicated. M-RFP - mitochondrial RFP, Pl-RFP - plastid RFP. Scale bar indicates 10 μm. To determine when dual targeting of NDC1 arose we analysed the targeting ability of rice (OsNDC1) and Physcomitrella (PpNDC1). For OsNDC1 we see a similar pattern as with AtNDC1 in that plastid targeting was observed in Arabidopsis cell suspensions and dual targeted to mitochondria and plastids in onion epidermal cells (Figure [F7]). For PpNDC1 only plastid targeting was observed in both Arabidopsis suspension and onion epidermal cells (Figure [F7]). GFP tagging of PpNDC1 in Physcomitrella tissue resulted in only plastid targeting (Figure [F7]). These results suggest that in lower plants such as Physcomitrella, NDC1 proteins are only targeted to plastids, and in higher plants such as Arabidopsis and rice NDC1 has additionally acquired targeting to mitochondria during plant evolution.
!~MM~! Protein sequences for all Arabidopsis type II NAD(P)H dehydrogenase proteins were obtained from the TAIR website (http://www.arabidopsis.org) (NDA1; At1g07180, NDA2; At2g29990. NDB1; At4g28220, NDB2; At4g05020, NDB3; At4g21490, NDB4; At2g20800, NDC1; At5g08740) and used in BlastP [[B60]] searches against Volvox carteri, Chlamydomonas reinhardtii (Chlamydomonas), Physcomitrella patens, Selaginella moellendorffii, Oryza sativa, Zea mays, Vitis vinifera, Glycine Max, and Populus trichocarpa protein databases using the Phytozome website (http://www.phytozome.net). Blastx searches were used in order to identify proteins from Picea glauca on the NCBI database (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov) [[B60]]. The known sequences for the Escherichia coli, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 NADH dehydrogenases were downloaded from the NCBI website (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov). Predictions of subcellular localizations were carried out using Predotar [[B61]], TargetP [[B62]] and Wolfpsort [[B63]]. The ATP predictor [[B64]] was also utilized to predict the probability of a given protein to be dual targeted to mitochondria and plastids. Peroxisomal targeting was predicted using the PTS1 predictor [[B29]], PredPlantPTS1 [[B30]] and by comparing the last 3 C-terminal amino acids with the known PTS1 sequences from the AraPerox database [[B31]]. Phylogenetic analysis was carried out by first creating a multiple sequence alignment of all proteins using MAFFT [[B65]]. The phylogenetic tree was calculated using MEGA 5 [[B66]] using statistical method of neighboring-joining with the number of bootstrap replications of 1000. RNA extraction from Arabidopsis thaliana, Oryza sativa and Physcomitrella patens was carried out using the RNeasy kit (Qiagen, Melbourne) according to manufacturer’s instructions. Reverse transcription was carried out using SuperScript™ III First-strand synthesis system (Invitrogen, Sydney). For some genes, cDNA clones were obtained from the Knowledge-based Oryza Molecular biological Encyclopedia (KOME) [[B67]] or the RIKEN Bioresource Center [[B68]]. cDNA or cDNA clones were used as templates to amplify full-length cDNAs or the last C-terminal 10 amino acids prior to the stop codon for cloning into N and C-terminal GFP vectors [[B3],[B25]] using recombinant Gateway technology (Invitrogen, Sydney). The targeting signals of the Pisum sativum small subunit of 1,5 – ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (SSU) and Cucubita sp. malate synthase were fused to RFP and used as a plastid and peroxisomal markers respectively [[B3],[B69]]. For mitochondrial controls three different constructs were utilised. For Arabidopsis suspension cells the targeting signal of the Glycine max alternative oxidase (AOX) was used [[B3]]. For onion cells the cytochrome c oxidase IV targeting signal from Saccharomyces cerevisiae fused to mCherry was utilised [[B70]]. Finally the full length coding sequence from the Physcomitrella alternative oxidase (Pp1s183_11V6) fused to mCherry was used in Physcomitrella tissue [[B45]]. Biolistic co-transformation of GFP and RFP/mCherry fusion vectors was performed on Arabidopsis cell suspensions and onion epidermal cells as previously described [[B3]]. Briefly, 5 μg of each GFP and RFP plasmid were co-precipitated onto gold particles and bombarded onto 4-day-old Arabidopsis cell suspensions and freshly peeled onion epidermal cells using the PDS-1000/He biolistic transformation system (Bio-Rad, Sydney). For putative Physcomitrella proteins, transformation was also performed on 7-day-old protonemal tissues. Following incubation for 12–24 h at 22°C (25°C for Physcomitrella) in the dark, GFP and RFP expression was visualized at 100X magnification using a BX61 Olympus microscope (Olympus, Melbourne) with the excitation wavelengths of 460/480 nm (GFP) and 535/555 nm (RFP), and emission wavelengths of 495–540 nm (GFP) and 570–625 nm (RFP). Images were captured using CellR imaging software (Olympus, Melbourne) as previously described [[B3]].
