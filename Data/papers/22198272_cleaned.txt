!~ABS~! Clade A protein phosphatases type 2C (PP2Cs) are negative regulators of abscisic acid (ABA) signaling that are inhibited in an ABA-dependent manner by PYRABACTIN RESISTANCE1 (PYR1)/PYR1-LIKE (PYL)/REGULATORY COMPONENTS OF ABA RECEPTORS (RCAR) intracellular receptors. We provide genetic evidence that a previously uncharacterized member of this PP2C family in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana), At5g59220, is a negative regulator of osmotic stress and ABA signaling and that this function was only apparent when double loss-of-function mutants with pp2ca-1/ahg3 were generated. At5g59220-green fluorescent protein and its close relative PP2CA-green fluorescent protein showed a predominant nuclear localization; however, hemagglutinin-tagged versions were also localized to cytosol and microsomal pellets. At5g59220 was selectively inhibited by some PYR/PYL ABA receptors, and close relatives of this PP2C, such as PP2CA/ABA-HYPERSENSITIVE GERMINATION3 (AHG3) and AHG1, showed a contrasting sensitivity to PYR/PYL inhibition. Interestingly, AHG1 was resistant to inhibition by the PYR/PYL receptors tested, which suggests that this seed-specific phosphatase is still able to regulate ABA signaling in the presence of ABA and PYR/PYL receptors and therefore to control the highly active ABA signaling pathway that operates during seed development. Moreover, the differential sensitivity of the phosphatases At5g59220 and PP2CA to inhibition by ABA receptors reveals a functional specialization of PYR/PYL ABA receptors to preferentially inhibit certain PP2Cs.
!~RES~! At5g59220 is not expressed in seeds (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION), but it is expressed in seedlings or different tissues of adult plants according to public microarray data (CITATION; Supplemental Fig. S2). Basal transcript levels of At5g59220 are lower than those reported for other clade A PP2Cs; however, its expression is highly induced by ABA or osmotic stress (CITATION; CITATION; Supplemental Fig. S2), and this induction was dramatically impaired in the areb1 areb2 abf3 triple mutant (CITATION). In order to investigate the relative contribution of At5g59220 to ABA signaling, we analyzed the ABA response of the At5g59220 loss-of-function mutant SALK_142672, which we have named hai1-1 (Fig. 1A). ABA-mediated inhibition of seedling establishment was similar in the single hai1-1 mutant compared with the wild type, and a double pp2ca-1 hai1-1 mutant did not show an enhanced response to ABA compared with pp2ca-1, even at low ABA concentrations (Fig. 1B; Supplemental Fig. S3). However, a double pp2ca-1 hai1-1 mutant was more sensitive to Glc- or mannitol-mediated inhibition of seedling establishment than single parental mutants (Fig. 1B; Supplemental Fig. S3). [[FIGURE]] We also generated Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) transgenic lines expressing hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged versions of the PP2Cs driven by the 35S promoter. With respect to PP2CA, we confirmed previous results obtained by CITATION, which showed that overexpression of PP2CA leads to an ABA-insensitive phenotype (Fig. 1C). Likewise, 35S:At5g59220 lines showed diminished sensitivity to ABA-mediated inhibition of seedling establishment and root growth, enhanced water loss, and diminished expression of ABA-inducible genes compared with the wild type (Fig. 1C; Supplemental Fig. S4). Conversely, a characteristic feature of the pp2ca-1 hai1-1 double mutant was an enhanced sensitivity to ABA-mediated inhibition of growth compared with single mutants, which suggests that At5g59220 attenuates ABA signaling in vegetative tissue (Fig. 2, A and B). Therefore, the very moderate ABA hypersensitivity of pp2ca-1 in root assays described by CITATION is likely explained by partial redundancy with At5g59220 or other PP2Cs (CITATION). [[FIGURE]] We also analyzed the transcriptional regulation of ABA-responsive genes in the double pp2ca-1 hai1-1 mutant compared with the wild type and single parental mutants. ABA-mediated induction of the genes KIN1, RAB18, and RD29B was more than twofold higher in the double mutant compared with the other genetic backgrounds (Fig. 2C). Expression of these genes in the single parental mutants showed a less than twofold difference with respect to the wild type. Finally, by measuring the loss of fresh weight of detached leaves, we could observe a reduced water loss of the double pp2ca-1 hai1-1 mutant compared with the wild type and single parental mutants (Fig. 2D). While the catalytic core of At5g59220 is closely related to PP2CA, the N-terminal sequence shows a clear divergence (Supplemental Fig. S1). Several clusters rich in Arg residues are present at the N-terminal sequence of At5g59220. Different programs for the prediction of subcellular localization reveal the presence of nuclear targeting signals in this region; indeed, two nuclear localization patterns are present, both the pattern of four basic residues (type SV40 T antigen) and the bipartite nuclear localization signal (Supplemental Fig. S1). Instead, PP2CA only displays the pattern of four basic residues, which is localized at the C terminus of the protein (Supplemental Fig. S1). In experiments where GFP fusion proteins were transiently expressed in tobacco (Nicotiana benthamiana) epidermal cells, both PP2CA and At5g59220 appeared to be predominantly localized to the nucleus, although some cytosolic expression was also observed (Fig. 3A). Deletion of the N-terminal region of At5g59220 (a construct expressing residues 98–413) led to a subcellular localization of the catalytic phosphatase core similar to GFP, whereas the fusion of residues 1 to 97 of At5g59220 to GFP rendered a nuclear GFP protein (Fig. 3A). [[FIGURE]] Proper elucidation of the subcellular localization of clade A PP2Cs is an important goal to better understand their role in plant physiology; however, biochemical fractionation studies have only been reported for HAB1 (CITATION). Since interaction of PP2CA with the plasma membrane transporters AKT2 and SLAC1 has been reported (CITATION; CITATION) and interaction of PP2CA and At5g59220 with SnRK2s was localized to both nucleus and cytosol (CITATION), we further investigated the subcellular localization of both PP2Cs by fractionation studies. To this end, we used the Arabidopsis transgenic lines that express HA-tagged versions of the PP2Cs (Fig. 1C). Both HA-PP2CA and HA-At5g59220 proteins appeared to be functional with respect to ABA signaling, since their constitutive expression led to reduced sensitivity to ABA (Fig. 1C). Both proteins showed cytosolic and nuclear localization, and interestingly, part of the protein pool was localized to either the microsomal or nuclear insoluble (chromatin-associated) fraction (Fig. 3B). A relative quantification of the subcellular distribution of HA-PP2CA and HA-At5g59220 indicated that most of the protein was localized at the cytosol, although these data also confirmed that a significant fraction of the protein, 13% and 28% for HA-PP2CA and HA-At5g59220, respectively, was localized in the nucleus. The apparently predominant nuclear localization of transiently expressed GFP-tagged PP2Cs might be explained because the lower volume of the nucleus, compared with the cytosol, leads to a higher concentration of GFP fusion proteins, enhancing the GFP fluorescent signal (Fig. 3A). Since both At5g59220 and PP2CA regulate different aspects of ABA signaling, we analyzed its possible regulation by PYR/PYL ABA receptors. Coexpression of these PP2Cs and PYR/PYLs in seedlings, roots, or guard cells could be documented in public microarray databases (Supplemental Fig. S2; CITATION; CITATION; CITATION). Thus, we analyzed the phosphatase activity of PP2CA and At5g59220 in the presence of seven PYR/PYL receptors, which represent the dimeric class (i.e. PYR1, PYL1, and PYL2) and the monomeric class (i.e. PYL4, PYL5, PYL6, and PYL8; CITATION; CITATION). Using a 100:1 ratio of receptor:PP2CA, between 40% and 80% of ABA-independent inhibition of PP2CA by some monomeric receptors was recently reported (CITATION). However, in our hands, using either a 4:1 ratio in phosphopeptide-based activity assays (Fig. 4A) or a 10:1 ratio in OST1 dephosphorylation assays (Fig. 4B), we did not detect such ABA-independent inhibition of PP2CA by the PYR/PYL receptors tested. In the best case, only a 10% to 15% ABA-independent inhibition of PP2CA by PYL8 was found (Fig. 4, A and B). In the presence of ABA, PP2CA was inhibited by all the receptors, although important differences could be observed depending on the receptor considered. For instance, PP2CA inhibition by PYL8 was much more effective than by PYR1 (inhibitory concentration to obtain 50% inhibition [IC50] = 0.5 and 25 μm, respectively), whereas IC50 values for the other receptors ranged between 4 and 10 μm ABA. Such differences were not noted previously, but it is likely that they were masked by the high concentration of receptor with respect to the PP2C used by CITATION. At5g59220 was relatively resistant to inhibition by PYL4 and PYL6 (IC50 > 50 μm), and IC50 for dimeric receptors, such as PYR1, PYL1, and PYL2, was approximately 30 μm ABA, whereas PYL5 and PYL8 where the most effective inhibitors (IC50 = 8 and 0.8 μm, respectively). Indeed, both PYL5 and PYL8 were the most effective inhibitors of PP2CA as well (IC50 = 3.7 and 0.5 μm, respectively). [[FIGURE]] Structural and genetic studies have shown the importance for the locking mechanism of the ternary receptor:ABA:PP2C complex of a conserved Trp residue of clade A PP2Cs, which establishes a water-mediated hydrogen bond with the ketone group of ABA in ternary complexes (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION; Supplemental Fig. S1). Interestingly, AHG1 is the only clade A PP2C that lacks this conserved Trp (CITATION). Therefore, we wondered whether this seed-specific PP2C would be subjected to PYR/PYL regulation. As can be observed in Figure 4A, AHG1 phosphatase activity was not significantly affected by PYR/PYL receptors even at 50 μm ABA. This result indicates that AHG1 could negatively regulate ABA signaling even in the presence of high levels of ABA and PYR/PYL receptors. To gain additional evidence for the biochemical regulation of the above-described PP2Cs, we also performed in vitro reconstitution of the ABA signaling cascade and tested the protection of OST1 activity by PYL4, PYL5, PYL6, and PYL8 in the presence of the different PP2Cs and ABA (Fig. 4B). Both PP2CA and At5g59220 efficiently dephosphorylated OST1, whereas AHG1 was less effective (Fig. 4). Coincubation of PP2CA in the presence of ABA either with PYL4, PYL5, PYL6 or PYL8 or of At5g59220 with PYL5 or PYL8 notably protected OST1 activity. PYL4 and PYL6 only modestly recovered OST1 activity when coincubated with At5g59220 in the presence of ABA. In agreement with the phosphatase assays described in Figure 4A, coincubation of AHG1 with PYR/PYL receptors did not prevent OST1 dephosphorylation. Finally, we used ABF2 as a substrate of OST1, and after generation of phosphorylated ABF2, we incubated it with PP2CA and At5g59220 (Fig. 4C). Both PP2Cs efficiently dephosphorylated ABF2, whereas coincubation with PYL8 in the presence of ABA abolished their activity against the transcription factor. Taking into account that a significant portion of PP2CA and At5g59220 is localized at the nucleus, these results suggest that ABFs might also be substrates of these PP2Cs.
!~MM~! Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) plants were routinely grown under greenhouse conditions in pots containing a 1:3 vermiculite:soil mixture. For plants grown under growth chamber conditions, seeds were surface sterilized by treatment with 70% ethanol for 20 min, followed by commercial bleach (2.5% sodium hypochlorite) containing 0.05% Triton X-100 for 10 min, and finally, four washes with sterile distilled water. Stratification of the seeds was conducted in the dark at 4°C for 3 d. Then, seeds were sown on CITATION; MS) plates composed of MS basal salts, 0.1% MES, and 1% agar. The pH was adjusted to 5.7 with KOH before autoclaving. Plates were sealed and incubated in a controlled-environment growth chamber at 22°C under a 16-h-light/8-h-dark photoperiod at 80 to 100 μE m−2 s−1. Constructs to investigate the subcellular localization of PP2CA (At3g11410) and At5g59220 were generated in Gateway-compatible vectors. To this end, the coding sequences of PP2CA, At5g59220, and the N-terminal extension (residues 1–97) and the catalytic core (residues 98–413) of At5g59220 were PCR amplified using the following primer pairs, respectively: FPP2CANcoI and RPP2CAnostopSalI; F5g59220 and Rnostop5g59; F5g59220 and RNterm2CB; FMSTV2CB and Rnostop5g59. The sequences of all primers used in this work are provided in Supplemental Table S1. The PCR products were cloned into the pCR8/GW/TOPO entry vector (Invitrogen) and recombined by Gateway LR reaction into the pMDC83 destination vector (CITATION). The different binary vectors were introduced into Agrobacterium tumefaciens C58C1 (pGV2260) by electroporation (CITATION). Transformed cells were grown in liquid Luria-Bertani medium to late exponential phase, and cells were harvested by centrifugation and resuspended in 10 mm MES-KOH, pH 5.6, containing 10 mm MgCl2 and 150 mm acetosyringone to an optical density at 600 nm of 1. These cells were mixed with an equal volume of Agrobacterium C58C1 (pCH32 35S:p19) expressing the silencing suppressor p19 of Tomato bushy stunt virus (CITATION) so that the final density of Agrobacterium solution was about 1. Bacteria were incubated for 3 h at room temperature and then injected into young fully expanded leaves of 4-week-old Nicotiana benthamiana plants. Leaves were examined after 3 to 4 d with a Leica TCS-SL confocal microscope and a laser scanning confocal imaging system. The coding sequence of PP2CA was amplified by PCR using the primers FPP2CANcoI and RPP2CASalI. The coding sequence of At5g59220 was amplified by PCR using the primers F5g59220 and Rnosto5g59. Next, both were cloned into pCR8/GW/TOPO and recombined by LR reaction into the ALLIGATOR2 destination vector (CITATION). The ALLIGATOR2-35S:3HA-PP2CA and 35S:3HA-At5g59220 constructs were transferred to Agrobacterium C58C1 (pGV2260; CITATION) by electroporation and used to transform Columbia wild-type plants by the floral dip method. T1 transgenic seeds were selected based on GFP visualization, and T3 progeny homozygous for the selection marker were used for further studies. To determine the sensitivity to inhibition of seedling establishment by ABA, Glc, or mannitol, the MS medium was supplemented with the indicated concentrations of these compounds. The percentage of seeds that had germinated and developed fully green expanded cotyledons was determined. Approximately 200 seeds of each genotype were sown in each medium and scored for germination and early growth at 3, 5, 7, and 10 d later. For root growth assays, seedlings were grown on vertically oriented MS medium plates for 4 to 5 d. Afterward, 20 plants were transferred to new plates containing MS medium lacking or supplemented with the indicated concentrations of ABA. After the indicated periods of time, the plates were scanned on a flatbed scanner to produce image files suitable for quantitative analysis using the NIH Image software ImageJ version 1.37. Nuclear fractionation was performed according to techniques described by CITATION and CITATION. Arabidopsis leaves of epitope HA-tagged PP2CA or At5g59220 transgenic lines were ground in lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 25% glycerol, 20 mm KCl, 2 mm EDTA, 2.5 mm MgCl2, and 250 mm Suc) containing protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche) and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF). The lysate was filtered through four layers of Miracloth (Calbiochem) and centrifuged at 1,000g for 10 min to pellet the nuclei. The cytosolic fraction was removed, and the pellet was washed in nuclei resuspension buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, 25% glycerol, 2.5 mm MgCl2, and 0.5% Triton X-100) to solubilize most proteins from the organelles. The nuclear pellet was resuspended in 5 volumes of medium salt buffer (CITATION; 20 mm Tris-HCl, 0.4 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 5% glycerol, 1 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.5 mm PMSF, and protease inhibitor cocktail [Roche]) and then frozen and thawed. After incubation with gentle mixing for 15 min at 4°C, the nuclear insoluble fraction containing the major protein histones was precipitated by centrifugation at 10,000g for 10 min, whereas the supernatant contained the nuclear soluble fraction. Detection of PP2CA or At5g59220 was performed using anti-HA-peroxidase conjugate (Roche). The purity of the different fractions was demonstrated using antibodies against histone H3 (Abcam), plasma membrane H+-ATPase (Dr. Ramón Serrano, Universidad Politecnica de Valencia), and Ponceau staining of the ribulose-1,6-bisphosphate carboxylase. A second fractionation procedure was used to analyze the presence of PP2CA and At5g59220 in cytosol or microsomal pellets (CITATION). Arabidopsis leaves of epitope HA-tagged PP2CA or At5g59220 transgenic lines were ground in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8, 2 mm EDTA, 20% glycerol, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol [DTT], and 25 mm CaCl2) containing protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche) and 1 mm PMSF. The lysate was filtered through Miracloth and centrifuged at 5,000g for 5 min to remove organelles and debris. Supernatants were centrifuged at 100,000g for 45 min to pellet microsomal membranes and to obtain the cytosolic soluble fraction. The resulting microsomal pellet was solubilized in resuspension buffer (25 mm Tris, pH 7.2, 10% Suc, 2 mm EDTA, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, protease inhibitor cocktail, 0.1 mm PMSF, and 25 mm CaCl2) using a 2-mL glass homogenizer. After mock or ABA treatment, plant material was collected and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen. Total RNA was extracted using a Qiagen RNeasy Plant Mini Kit, and 1 μg of the RNA obtained was reverse transcribed using 0.1 μg of oligo(dT)15 primer and Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Roche) to finally obtain a 40-μL cDNA solution. Reverse transcription-quantitative (RT-q)PCR amplifications and measurements were performed using an ABI PRISM 7000 Sequence Detection System (Perkin-Elmer Applied Biosystems), and they were monitored using the Eva-Green fluorescent stain (Biotium). Relative quantification of gene expression data was carried out using the 2−ΔΔCT or comparative cycle threshold (CT) method (CITATION). Expression levels were normalized using the CT values obtained for the β-Actin8 gene. Gene induction ratios were calculated as the expression ratio between ABA-treated plantlets and mock-treated plantlets. The presence of a single PCR product was further verified by dissociation analysis in all amplifications. All quantifications were made in triplicate on RNA samples obtained from three independent experiments. The sequences of the primers used for RT-qPCR amplification have been described previously (CITATION). The coding sequence of PP2CA was amplified by PCR using the primers F2CASalINdeI and R2CASmaISalI. The full-length At5g59220 protein was not soluble; therefore, we generated a ΔN-At5g59220 version, since according to the structure of ternary complexes reported so far, N-terminal deletions of PP2Cs are able to interact with PYR/PYL proteins (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION). To this end, the coding sequence encompassing the catalytic core of At5g59220, residues 98 to 413, was amplified by PCR using the primers FMSTV2CB and RHAstopP2B. PCR products were cloned into pCR8/GW/TOPO, then the coding sequence of PP2CA was excised from this plasmid using NdeI/SalI double digestion and subcloned into pET28a, whereas the coding sequence of At5g5922098–413 was excised using EcoRI digestion and subcloned into pET28a. The coding sequence of AHG1 was excised from a pACT2 construct (kindly provided by Dr. J.F. Quintero, Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas) using NcoI/BamHI double digestion and subcloned into pETM11. Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) cells transformed with the corresponding pET28a/pETM11 construct were grown in 50 mL of Luria-Bertani medium supplemented with 50 μg mL−1 kanamycin to an optical density at 600 nm of 0.6 to 0.8. Then, 1 mm isopropylthio-β-galactoside was added, and the cells were harvested 3 h after induction and stored at −80°C before purification. The pellet was resuspended in 2 mL of buffer HIS (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 250 mm KCl, 10% glycerol, 0.1% Tween 20, and 10 mm mercaptoethanol), and the cells were sonicated in a Branson Sonifier. A cleared lysate was obtained after centrifugation at 14,000g for 15 min, and it was diluted with 2 volumes of buffer HIS. The protein extract was applied to a 0.5 mL nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid agarose column, and the column was washed with 10 mL of buffer HIS supplemented with 20% glycerol and 30 mm imidazol. Bound protein was eluted with buffer HIS supplemented with 20% glycerol and 250 mm imidazol. Phosphatase activity was measured using the RRA(phosphoT)VA peptide as substrate, which has a Km of 0.5 to 1 μm for eukaryotic PP2Cs (CITATION). Assays were performed in a 100-μL reaction volume containing 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, 25 μm peptide substrate, and 0.5 μm PP2C. When indicated, PYR-PYL recombinant proteins and ABA were included in the PP2C activity assay. ABA concentrations were 0.5, 1, 5, 10, 20, 40, and 50 μm. After incubation for 60 min at 30°C, the reaction was stopped by the addition of 30 μL of molybdate dye (CITATION), and the absorbance was read at 630 nm with a 96-well plate reader. Phosphatase activity was also measured using phosphorylated OST1 and ΔCABF2 (amino acids 1–173, containing the C1, C2, and C3 protein kinase targets) as substrates (CITATION; CITATION). Autophosphorylated OST1 or transphosphorylated ΔCABF2 were prepared in a 60-min reaction. Dephosphorylation of OST1 or ΔCABF2 was achieved by incubation with the different PP2Cs. Assays to test the recovery of OST1 activity were done by previous incubation of the PP2C for 10 min in the absence or presence of 30 μm ABA and the indicated PYR/PYL. Next, the reaction mixture was incubated for 50 min at room temperature in 30 μL of kinase buffer: 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 20 mm MgCl2, 2 mm MnCl2, and 3.5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (3,000 Ci mmol−1). The reaction was stopped by adding Laemmli buffer. After the reaction, proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE using an 8% acrylamide gel and transferred to an Immobilon-P membrane (Millipore). Radioactivity was detected using a phosphorimage system (FLA5100; Fujifilm). After scanning, the same membrane was used for Ponceau staining.
