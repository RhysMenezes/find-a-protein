!~ABS~! Constitutive endocytic recycling is a crucial mechanism allowing regulation of the activity of proteins at the plasma membrane and for rapid changes in their localization, as demonstrated in plants for PIN-FORMED (PIN) proteins, the auxin transporters. To identify novel molecular components of endocytic recycling, mainly exocytosis, we designed a PIN1-green fluorescent protein fluorescence imaging–based forward genetic screen for Arabidopsis thaliana mutants that showed increased intracellular accumulation of cargos in response to the trafficking inhibitor brefeldin A (BFA). We identified bex5 (for BFA-visualized exocytic trafficking defective), a novel dominant mutant carrying a missense mutation that disrupts a conserved sequence motif of the small GTPase, RAS GENES FROM RAT BRAINA1b. bex5 displays defects such as enhanced protein accumulation in abnormal BFA compartments, aberrant endosomes, and defective exocytosis and transcytosis. BEX5/RabA1b localizes to trans-Golgi network/early endosomes (TGN/EE) and acts on distinct trafficking processes like those regulated by GTP exchange factors on ADP-ribosylation factors GNOM-LIKE1 and HOPM INTERACTOR7/BFA-VISUALIZED ENDOCYTIC TRAFFICKING DEFECTIVE1, which regulate trafficking at the Golgi apparatus and TGN/EE, respectively. All together, this study identifies Arabidopsis BEX5/RabA1b as a novel regulator of protein trafficking from a TGN/EE compartment to the plasma membrane.
!~RES~! To understand the mechanism of PIN1 endocytic recycling and to identify molecular components that regulate this process, we used a forward genetic approach. Complete inhibition of protein cycling might be lethal; therefore, a typical morphology-based screen for the identification of mutants defective in the endocytic recycling of the proteins might be ineffective. To overcome this limitation, we designed a PIN1-green fluorescent protein (GFP) fluorescence imaging-based screen and looked for mutants that showed subcellular defects in the brefeldin A (BFA)–induced intracellular accumulation of PIN1-GFP. The fungal toxin BFA has proven to be an excellent tool to investigate protein trafficking, as it inhibits intracellular trafficking, mainly secretion, and causes the accumulation of PM proteins, such as basal (rootward) localized PIN1, into large aggregates known as BFA compartments or BFA bodies (CITATION). Nonetheless, long-term BFA treatment leads to the gradual disappearance of PIN1 from the BFA compartment and its relocation to the apical (shootward) PM (CITATION). Hence, we screened for mutants that, in contrast with the PIN1pro:PIN1-GFP control line, showed abnormal PIN1-GFP intracellular accumulation after a 16-h treatment with 50 µM BFA, indicating defective exocytosis. This approach is distinct from the previously reported PIN1pro:PIN1-GFP screens that were focused on PIN1-GFP aggregations in the absence of any treatments (pat mutants; CITATION; CITATION) or on short-term BFA treatments (ben mutants; CITATION). By screening the progeny of 1200 M1 ethyl methanesulfonate–mutagenized PIN1pro:PIN1-GFP individuals, we obtained five nonallelic mutants (H. Tanaka and J. Friml, unpublished data) that were named bex1 to -5. Here, we identify and characterize the bex5 mutant. In the wild type, endogenous PIN1 or transgenic PIN1-GFP proteins showed intracellular endosomal agglomerations after a 1.5-h treatment with 25 µM BFA (Figures 1A to 1F; see Supplemental Figure 1A online). These BFA-induced PIN1 or PIN1-GFP agglomerations were enhanced in the bex5-1 mutant (Figures 1A to 1F; see Supplemental Figure 1A online). Similar to PIN1, the PIN2 and PIN2-GFP proteins displayed enhanced intracellular aggregation in the bex5-1 mutant following BFA treatment (Figures 1A, 1B, and 1E to 1H; see Supplemental Figure 1A online). Interestingly, other proteins, such as ARF1 (see Supplemental Figures 1B and 1C online), and nonpolar PM proteins, such as aquaporin GFP-PIP2a (Figures 1I and 1J; see Supplemental Figures 1F and 1G online) or PM ATPase (see Supplemental Figures 1D and 1E online), also showed enhanced BFA-induced intracellular accumulation in the PIN1pro:PIN1-GFP;bex5-1 mutant. These results show that the bex5-1 mutation enhances BFA-induced protein accumulation, indicating a more general defect in protein trafficking. [[FIGURE]] To further investigate the cause of bex5 hypersensitivity to BFA, we analyzed the cell ultrastructure by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). In PIN1pro:PIN1-GFP roots, a 1-h treatment with 50 µM BFA caused the heterogeneous aggregation of vesicle-like structures that became surrounded at their periphery by Golgi stacks (Figure 1K), as reported previously (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION). We named this characteristic endosomal agglomeration a “typical BFA compartment,” as 94% of the total BFA compartments counted in the PIN1pro:PIN1-GFP roots (n = 31 BFA compartments) had this morphology. In contrast, in the PIN1pro:PIN1-GFP;bex5-1 mutant, BFA induced a different aggregation pattern (Figures 1K and 1L; see Supplemental Figure 1H online). Only 38% of the PIN1pro:PIN1-GFP;bex5-1 BFA-induced aggregates (n = 42 BFA-induced aggregates) displayed the typical BFA compartment morphology, while the others looked more enlarged, abnormally shaped, and less compact, and the vesicles from their composition displayed an altered morphology such as abnormal size (often larger than in the control), shape (distortion of the round shape probably due to vesicle fusion), and composition (more dense) (Figures 1K and 1L; see Supplemental Figure 1H online). To test whether the impaired protein trafficking caused by the bex5 mutation affects overall plant development, we investigated the morphology of PIN1pro:PIN1-GFP;bex5 seedlings. PIN1pro:PIN1-GFP;bex5 seedlings had smaller cotyledons and shorter roots than PIN1pro:PIN1-GFP seedlings (Figure 1M; see Supplemental Figures 1I and 1J online), indicating that the BEX5 protein is important for plant growth and development. Previous studies have shown that BFA also affects root growth (CITATION, CITATION). To investigate whether PIN1pro:PIN1-GFP;bex5-1 displays a different root growth sensitivity to BFA, we germinated and grew the mutant on medium supplemented with BFA. PIN1pro:PIN1-GFP;bex5-1 seedlings on BFA had shorter roots than control seedlings (Figures 1N to 1P; see Supplemental Figure 1K online), indicating that, not only at the subcellular level but also at the plant level, PIN1pro:PIN1-GFP;bex5-1 is hypersensitive to BFA. Together, these findings support the hypothesis that the bex5-1 mutant is defective in some BFA-sensitive trafficking processes. To test if the bex5 mutant is defective in exocytosis, we performed a 90-min treatment with 50 µM BFA followed by a 90-min wash out in Murashige and Skoog (MS) liquid medium. The intracellular agglomeration of PIN proteins caused by BFA treatment is reversible (CITATION; CITATION); hence, we could observe almost complete disappearance of PIN1-GFP, PIN2, or GFP-PIP2a from the BFA compartments in the control cells treated with BFA followed by wash out (Figure 2A; see Supplemental Figures 2A and 2C online). In contrast, strong BFA-induced PIN1-GFP, PIN2, or GFP-PIP2a agglomerations persisted in the bex5-1 mutant after BFA removal (Figures 2A and 2B; see Supplemental Figures 2A to 2D online). This result suggests that exocytosis is defective in the PIN1pro:PIN1-GFP;bex5-1 mutant and indicates that BEX5 acts as a regulator of protein trafficking to the PM. [[FIGURE]] During the long-term BFA treatment, PM proteins with a basal localization, such as PIN1, first agglomerate in the BFA compartments and then subsequently disappear from the BFA compartment and relocalize to the apical PM (CITATION). This process involves protein translocation from the basal to the apical side of a polarized cell and is called transcytosis (CITATION). No or very little PIN1-GFP agglomerations could be observed in the PIN1pro:PIN1-GFP root cells treated for 12 h with 50 µM BFA (Figure 2C; see Supplemental Figure 2E online). In contrast, PIN1pro:PIN1-GFP;bex5-1 showed strong intracellular PIN1-GFP accumulation (Figures 2C and 2D; see Supplemental Figures 2E and 2F online). The BFA-treated seedlings were briefly stained with propidium iodide to determine their cell viability (see Supplemental Figures 2E and 2F online). The observed impaired transcytosis indicates that the bex5-1 mutant is defective in PIN1-GFP trafficking from the BFA compartment to the apical side of the PM, which supports the hypothesis that the bex5-1 mutation affects protein trafficking to the PM. Defective protein trafficking to the PM in the bex5 mutant may impair secretion and/or recycling. The bex5-1 mutant displayed BFA hypersensitivity also when we performed the BFA treatment in the presence of the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide (Figures 2E to 2H), indicating that the PIN2-GFP (Figures 2E and 2F) or PIN1-GFP (Figures 2G and 2H) accumulation in the enlarged BFA bodies comes from a recycled but not newly synthesized pool of proteins. To examine if the degradation pathway is impaired in the bex5-1 mutant, we performed a dark treatment experiment that allows the visualization of the vacuolar targeting of GFP-tagged proteins (CITATION; CITATION). A 4-h dark treatment followed by the observation of PIN2-GFP fluorescence revealed that in both the wild type and the bex5-1 mutant, PIN2-GFP accumulated into the vacuoles (Figures 2I and 2J). Furthermore, a 5-min staining with 2 µM FM4-64 followed by a 1.5-h treatment with 25 µM BFA showed the expected overaccumulation of FM4-64 and PIN2-GFP into abnormal BFA bodies in the bex5-1 mutant (Figures 2K and 2L). Moreover, in both PIN2pro:PIN2-GFP and PIN2pro:PIN2-GFP;bex5-1 seedlings, FM4-64 also labeled the tonoplast (Figures 2K and 2L). These two findings show that the bex5 mutation does not interfere with the trafficking of proteins from the TGN/EE to the vacuoles and support the hypothesis that recycling is defective in the bex5 mutant. To gain further insight into trafficking defects in bex5, we analyzed the localization of the PIN2-GFP marker in the bex5 mutant. Live imaging of untreated bex5 mutant roots revealed an increased endosomal and PM PIN2-GFP signal (Figures 3A to 3D). PIN2-GFP endosomes in the mutant cells were enlarged, brighter, and sometimes appeared in aggregates (Figures 3A to 3E). Similarly, the uptake of the membrane-selective fluorescent dye FM4-64, commonly used to investigate endocytosis and vesicle trafficking in eukaryotic cells (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION; CITATION; CITATION), revealed slightly abnormal endosomal compartments in the bex5-1 mutant (Figures 3F and 3G; see Supplemental Figures 3A and 3B online). These findings, together with the abnormal morphology of the BFA compartment, indicate that the bex5-1 mutation affects endosomal compartments that are sensitive to BFA, such as the Golgi and/or the TGN/EE. [[FIGURE]] Thus, we investigated the localization of the Golgi marker Sec21 (CITATION). By performing immunolocalization experiments, we found that Sec21 did not show altered localization in the bex5-1 mutant (see Supplemental Figures 3C and 3D online), indicating that the GA morphology may not be affected by the bex5-1 mutation. As the TGN/EE is another endosomal compartment that is a target of BFA, we investigated the localization of commonly used TGN/EE markers such as VHAa1 (CITATION), clathrin light chain (CLC; CITATION), and RabA2a (CITATION). Live imaging of VHAa1-GFP and CLC-GFP in the bex5-1 mutant revealed no dramatic or quantifiable defects in the localization of these proteins, although sometimes VHAa1-GFP and CLC-GFP endosomes appeared slightly enlarged and brighter (Figures 3H and 3I; see Supplemental Figures 3E and 3F online). Notably, we found that RabA2a GTPase, a protein defining a TGN compartment that contributes to cell plate formation (CITATION), displayed an impaired localization in the bex5-1 mutant (Figures 3J and 3K). These results suggest that the bex5-1 mutant is impaired in a process that takes place at a TGN/EE compartment. TEM performed on roots of untreated seedlings confirmed that bex5-1 endosomes have a defective morphology (Figures 3L to 3N; see Supplemental Figures 3G to 3J online). The typical morphology of the GA-TGN/EE complex observed in the PIN1pro:PIN1-GFP root cells was impaired in the root cells of the bex5-1 mutant (Figures 3L to 3N; see Supplemental Figures 3G to 3J online). The predominant defect in the mutant was characterized by endosomal/vesicle-like clusters present in the neighborhood of GA-TGN/EE, mainly at one of its sides. The vesicles had a more heterogeneous size and generally larger size and were often fused and abnormally shaped (Figures 3L to 3N; see Supplemental Figures 3G to 3J online). The abnormal accumulation of aberrant vesicles in the vicinity of the TGN/EE suggests that bex5-1 is defective in vesicle budding and/or trafficking and supports a role of BEX5 in protein/vesicle trafficking from a TGN/EE compartment to the PM. Next, we investigated the site of BEX5 action in protein trafficking. For this purpose, we analyzed the genetic relationship between bex5 and ben1, a mutant defective in protein trafficking from the TGN/EE to the RE (CITATION), and gnl1, a mutant impaired at the GA (CITATION; CITATION). Both ben1 and gnl1 are distinct from bex5, as they showed a dramatically reduced intracellular accumulation of PIN1 or PIN2 following a 1.5-h treatment with 25 µM BFA (Figures 4A to 4F), a phenotype largely opposite to that of bex5. When crossed into the bex5-1 mutant background, ben1 showed complete and gnl1 showed partial epistasis to bex5-1 (Figures 4A to 4F; see Supplemental Figures 4A to 4C online). Thus, the root cells of the double ben1-2 bex5-1 or gnl1 bex5-1 mutants showed less BFA-induced accumulation of PIN1, PIN1-GFP, or PIN2 protein than the single bex5-1 mutant (Figures 4A to 4F; see Supplemental Figures 4A to 4C online). This suggests that BEX5 and the large ARF-GEFs BEN1 and GNL1 act at different steps along the intracellular trafficking pathway and that, in a subcellular membrane flow, BEX5 acts after BEN1 or GNL1. However, both double mutants showed additive effects regarding the root length (Figure 4G) and overall plant growth and development of the aerial part (Figure 4H), consistent with the notion that combined partial defects at two instances of the protein-trafficking pathways have a greater impact on plant growth than a single defect. Overall, these results are consistent with the finding that bex5, ben1, and gnl1 disrupt intracellular protein trafficking at distinct steps, with bex5 impairing protein trafficking in the post-TGN/EE pathway. [[FIGURE]] We identified bex5-1 as a dominant mutant (see Supplemental Figures 5A to 5C online). Using 291 recombinants selected for the wild-type subcellular phenotype, we cloned bex5-1 by map-based cloning to a region of 236 kb on the left arm of chromosome 1 (Figure 5A). Because of a low recombination rate in this chromosome region, we chose not to further narrow down the interval but to use a candidate approach for gene identification. We sequenced several candidates and identified a point mutation that causes amino acid substitution S156F in a conserved GTP binding site in the open reading frame of RabA1b (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION) (Figure 5B). [[FIGURE]] To test whether the mutation in RabA1b is responsible for the defective protein trafficking, we analyzed two knockout T-DNA insertion alleles, bex5-2 and bex5-3 (see Supplemental Figure 5D online). These mutants did not show similar phenotypes to bex5-1 regarding the root growth hypersensitivity to BFA (see Supplemental Figure 5E online) or exocytosis defects (see Supplemental Figures 5F to 5I online), although the bex5-2 mutant showed mild defects in subcellular BFA sensitivity (see Supplemental Figures 5F to 5I online). These results suggest functional redundancy with other RabA1 GTPases or GTPases from the RabA class. To confirm that the bex5-1 mutation in RabA1b is responsible for the observed protein-trafficking defects, we expressed the bex5-1 dominant mutation (genomic DNA amplified from the bex5-1 mutant) under the control of both the native and the strong constitutive cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter and subsequently transformed these constructs into the PIN1pro:PIN1-GFP transgenic line. Similar to the bex5-1 mutant, transgenic BEX5pro:bex5-1 (Figures 5C to 5E) or 35Spro:bex5-1 (see Supplemental Figures 6A to 6C online) showed high intracellular PIN1-GFP agglomerations after a 1.5-h treatment with 25 µM BFA. In contrast, week and sporadic BFA compartments could be observed in the PIN1pro:PIN1-GFP control (Figures 5C to 5E; see Supplemental Figures 6A to 6C online). Similar retention of PIN1-GFP into abnormal BFA bodies in bex5-1, BEX5pro:bex5-1, and 35Spro:bex5-1 confirms that the bex5-1 mutation causes the observed protein-trafficking defects. Surprisingly, overexpression of the wild-type clone (35Spro:GFP-RabA1b) in the wild-type background also resembles the bex5-1 subcellular phenotype (see Supplemental Figures 6D to 6I online). This indicates that wild-type 35Spro:GFP-RabA1b does not suppress the bex5-1 phenotype but generates a dominant phenotype. To investigate the nature of the bex5-1 mutation, we generated GTP binding and GTP hydrolysis RabA1b mutants by creating mutations in the conserved sequence motifs that are well known to either stabilize the GDP-bound (SN) or GTP-bound (QL) form (CITATION). Thus, we generated RabA1bpro:GFP-RabA1b S27N and RabA1bpro:GFP-RabA1b Q72L mutants known to act as DN and CA versions, respectively (CITATION). Immunolocalization of PIN1 and PIN2 proteins in the roots of RabA1bpro:GFP-RabA1b S27N and RabA1bpro:GFP-RabA1b Q72L treated for 1.5 h with 25 µM BFA showed that DN RabA1bpro:GFP-RabA1b S27N but not CA RabA1bpro:GFP-RabA1b Q72L displayed BFA oversensitivity similarly to the bex5-1 mutant (Figure 6). These results show that bex5-1, carrying the S156F mutation in the ETSAL conserved sequence motif of RabA1b small GTPase, acts as a DN mutant and identifies this mutation as a potential target of DN manipulations in small GTPases. [[FIGURE]] Next, we investigated the subcellular localization of BEX5/RabA1b by generating transgenic RabA1bpro:GFP-RabA1b and RabA1bpro:RFP-RabA1b in the wild-type background. Both transgenic constructs showed the same pattern of localization throughout the root, with higher occurrence in the root meristem, specifically in the root cap (Figure 7A; for RabA1bpro:GFP-RabA1b). At the subcellular level, red fluorescent protein (RFP)-RabA1b (Figure 7B) or GFP-RabA1b (Figure 7C) labeled punctate structures resembling endosomes that were sensitive to BFA (Figure 7D). In addition, RFP-RabA1b and GFP-RabA1b showed faint localization at the PM (Figures 7A to 7C) and, notably, they strongly labeled the cell plates during cell division (Figures 7A and 7B). [[FIGURE]] To address the identity of the BEX5/RabA1b compartments, we performed colocalization experiments and found that GFP-RabA1b endosomes showed partial colocalization with early accumulation (5 min after treatment) of the lipophilic styryl dye FM4-64 (Figure 7E; see Supplemental Figure 7A online). It has been shown that FM4-64 labels endosomal compartments of the endocytic pathway (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION) and that the early site of FM4-64 accumulation corresponds to the TGN/EE (CITATION; CITATION). The partial colocalization of GFP-RabA1b endosomes with early FM4-64–labeled endosomes indicates that BEX5/RabA1b localizes at a TGN/EE compartment. Moreover, GFP-RabA1b showed partial or complete colocalization with other known TGN/EE markers, such as VHAa1-RFP (Figure 7F; see Supplemental Figure 7B online), SYP61 (Figure 7G; see Supplemental Figure 7C online), MIN7/BEN1 (Figure 7H; see Supplemental Figure 7D online), and YFP-RabA2a (Figure 7I; see Supplemental Figure 7E online) (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION). In contrast, GFP-RabA1b did not colocalize with Golgi markers Sec21 (see Supplemental Figure 7F online) and N-ST-GFP (see Supplemental Figure 7G online) (CITATION), although it often showed localization in their immediate proximity (see Supplemental Figures 7F and 7G online). Together, these results show that BEX5/RabA1b localizes at a TGN/EE compartment and further support the notion that BEX5/RabA1b plays a role in protein trafficking from this compartment to the PM.
!~MM~! PIN1pro:PIN1-GFP (CITATION), PIN2pro:PIN2-GFP (CITATION), VHAa1pro:VHAa1-GFP (CITATION), VHAa1pro:VHAa1-RFP (CITATION), RabA2apro:YFP-RabA2a (CITATION), 35Spro:GFP-PIP2a (CITATION), 35Spro:CLC-GFP (CITATION), and 35Spro:N-ST-YFP (CITATION) marker lines and the ben1-2 (CITATION) mutant in Arabidopsis thaliana have been described previously. The seeds were stratified for 2 d in the dark at 4°C, and the seedlings were germinated and grown vertically in Petri dishes containing 0.8% agar and 0.5× MS medium with 1% Suc (pH 5.9) mainly at 18°C, long-day photoperiod but also at 22°C, continuous illumination. gnl1 (Salk_030701), bex5-2 (SAIL_875_F08), and bex5-3 (GABI_726E08) alleles were identified from available T-DNA collections (CITATION). To identify bex mutants, 35,000 M2 PIN1pro:PIN1-GFP seedlings descended from 1200 0.3% ethyl methanesulfonate–mutagenized M1 plants were analyzed with the epifluorescence microscope. The bex5-1 mutant on chromosome 1 was mapped between F19K19 (5.722 Mb) simple sequence-length polymorphism and F28G4_FspBI (5.958 Mb) cleaved-amplified polymorphic sequence markers. A total of 291 recombinants from an F2 cross between bex5-1 (Columbia background) and Landsberg erecta were used. For Columbia/Landsberg erecta polymorphism information, the Monsanto Arabidopsis Polymorphism and the Ler Sequence Collection (Cereon Genomics) were used, and for information regarding single-nucleotide polymorphisms and insertions/deletions, The Arabidopsis Information Resource (http://www.Arabidopsis.org) was used. Five-day-old seedlings were incubated for the indicated time points in MS medium containing one of the following drugs: BFA (Invitrogen; 25 or 50 μM in DMSO solvent), cycloheximide (Sigma; 50 μM in DMSO solvent), propidium iodide (Sigma; 1 mg/mL in water diluted 1:100), and FM4-64 (Invitrogen; 2 or 4 µM in water solvent); or they were germinated for 5 or 7 d on MS medium supplemented with BFA at 5 or 7.5 μM. For the evaluation of bex5 oversensitivity to BFA, the fluorescence intensity of PIN2-GFP or PIN1-GFP was measured in a defined region of 1416 E-4 (PIN2-GFP) and 7080 E-5 (PIN1-GFP) for BFA bodies and in a defined region of 5015 E-4 (PIN2-GFP) and 2537 E-4 (PIN1-GFP) for PMs by using the corresponding functions of ImageJ 1.41 software (http://rsbweb.nih.gov/ij/). One hundred BFA bodies and 100 PMs (1 BFA body and 1 PM per cell; 10 cells per root) from 10 root tips were evaluated. To evaluate the area of the BFA bodies, 150 bodies from 10 root tips per line (∼15 BFA bodies per root) were measured. To examine the ultrastructure of the BFA bodies, the BFA bodies from 32 PIN1pro:PIN1-GFP cells (five root tips) and 38 PIN1pro:PIN1-GFP;bex5 cells (five root tips) were counted on TEM images. To evaluate PIN2-GFP fluorescence at the PM and in the endosomes, the fluorescence of 100 PMs and the total fluorescence from the interior of 100 cells were measured. Ten cells per root and a total of 10 root tips were evaluated per line. Additionally, the fluorescence and area of PIN2-GFP endosomes were gauged in 300 endosomes from 10 root tips per line (30 endosomes per root from ∼10 cells). Immunolocalizations were performed on 4- to 5-d-old seedlings using the Intavis in situ pro robot, as described by CITATION. The following dilutions were used for primary antibodies: anti-PIN1 rabbit (CITATION), 1:1000; anti-PIN2 rabbit (CITATION), 1:1000; anti-ARF1 rabbit (CITATION), 1:1000; anti-MIN7/BEN1 rabbit (CITATION), 1:1000; anti-Sec21 rabbit (CITATION), 1:1000; anti-SYP61 rabbit (CITATION), 1:500; anti-PM–ATPase mouse (CITATION), 1:1000; and anti-GFP mouse (Roche), 1:1000. For the secondary antibodies, Alexa488 anti-mouse (Invitrogen), 1:600 and Cy3 anti-mouse (Sigma), 1:600 were used. Root tips of 4-d-old seedlings of PIN1pro:PIN1-GFP and PIN1pro:PIN1-GFP;bex5-1 untreated and treated for 1 h with 50 µM BFA were excised and processed as described by CITATION. bex5-1 (bex5-1_BglII_FP, 5′-AGAATCGCTCTGCTTCATGGAAAGAT-3′, and bex5-1_RP, 5′-TCAATTTGAGCAGCACCCGAG-3′, product size is 211 bp; BglII cuts wild-type sequence), bex5-2 (bex5-2_FP, 5′-AATGTATGTCATGGCGTGAGTC-3′, and bex5-2_RP, 5′-CTCCCATTCACTCCAAAACTG-3′), bex5-3 (bex5-3_FP, 5′-AGTTGACTGCATTTGACCACC-3′, and bex5-3_RP, 5′-TGAACGTCGGCATTTTAGATC-3′), ben1-2 (ben1-2_FP, 5′-TGGAAAGTGAAATTGGTGAGC-3′, and ben1-2_RP, 5′-CAAGGATTCTTCTCTGCATGG-3′), and gnl1 (gnl1_FP, 5′-TCACGTTAGATCCCGTACTGG-3′, and gnl1_RP, 5′-AGCAGTTTCCAAATTGCCTC-3′) were genotyped using the stated primers. For RT-PCR, total RNA was isolated from 6-d-old seedlings using the Qiagen RNeasy Plant Mini kit. The cDNA was synthesized with the Reverse Transcription System (Promega) from 1 µg of total RNA that was previously decontaminated with an Ambion TURBO DNA-free kit. The total length of BEX5 was amplified using BEX5_FP (5′-ATGGCAGGGTACAGAGTGGAA-3′) and BEX5_RP (5′-ATTTGAGCAGCACCCGAGTTT-3′) primers. Tubulin (Tub_FP, 5′-ACTCGTTGGGAGGAGGAACT-3′, and Tub_RP, 5′-ACACCAGACATAGTAGCAGAAATCAAG-3′) was used as a control. The PCR underwent 25 cycles. To create RabA1bpro:GFP-RabA1b and RabA1bpro:RFP-RabA1b, the promoter was introduced into pDONR P4-P1R (attB4_ RabA1b_prom_FP, 5′-GGGGACAACTTTGTATAGAAAAGTTGTTATGACCATTTCGCTGACCGTA-3′, and attB1r_ RabA1b_prom_RP, 5′-GGGGACTGCTTTTTTGTACAAACTTGTCTCCGCCGTCTCCAGGTGGTT-3′) and the gene into pDONR P2R-P3 (attB2r_ RabA1b_FP, 5′-GGGGACAGCTTTCTTGTACAAAGTGGTTATGGCAGGGTACAGAGTGGAA-3′, and attB3_ RabA1b_stop_RP, 5′-GGGGACAACTTTGTATAATAAAGTTGTTCAATTTGAGCAGCACCCGAG-3′). Then, by multisite Gateway recombination, these fragments were introduced with pEN-L1-F-L2 or pEN-L1-R-L2 into pB7m34GW,0 (CITATION; http://www.psb.ugent.be/gateway). To create 35Spro:GFP-RabA1b, we introduced the entry clone containing RabA1b together with pEN-L4-2-R1 and pEN-L1-F-L2 into pK7m34GW,0. All constructs were transformed into the Columbia wild type. To make 35Spro:bex5-1, the mutated form of BEX5 was amplified from bex5-1 DNA using attB1_bex5-1_FP, 5′-GGGGACAAGTTTGTACAAAAAAGCAGGCTTTATGGCAGGGTACAGAGTGGAA-3′, and attB2_bex5-1_stop_RP, 5′-GGGGACCACTTTGTACAAGAAAGCTGGGTTTCAATTTGAGCAGCACCCGAG-3′. The fragment was introduced into pDONR221, then into pB7WG2,0, and transformed into the PIN1pro:PIN1-GFP transgenic line. To generate BEX5pro:bex5-1, the BEX5 promoter was amplified together with the mutated gene from the bex5-1 mutant DNA using attB1_BEX5_prom_FP, 5′-GGGGACAAGTTTGTACAAAAAAGCAGGCTTTATGACCATTTCGCTGACCGTA-3′, and attB2_bex5-1_stop_RP. The fragment was introduced into pDONR221, then into pB7FWG,0, and further transformed into the PIN1pro:PIN1-GFP transgenic line. S27N and Q72L mutant versions of RabA1bpro:GFP-RabA1b were generated by PCR mutagenesis of RabA1bpro:GFP-RabA1b in pGWB1, which contained 2.5 kb of the 5′ flanking and 1.0 kb of the 3′ flanking sequences, using SN f, 5′-GAGTTGGCAAAAACAATCTCCTTTC-3′, SN r, 5′-GAAAGGAGATTGTTTTTGCCAACTC-3′, QL f, 5′-TTTGGGACACTGCTGGTCTGGAGAG-3′, and QL r, 5′-CTCTCCAGACCAGCAGTGTCCCAAA-3′. The original RabA1bpro:GFP-RabA1b fragment was made by the technique of fluorescent tagging of full-length proteins (CITATION). Primer sequences used for the amplification of genomic fragments were RabA1b-1, 5′-CACCCATTTCGCTGACCGTAGATAACCCAGT-3′, RabA1b-2, 5′-CCGGAACTCACTCACTTGGATTTGGTA-3′, RabA1b-3, 5′-ACCACCTGGAGACGGCGGAGATGGTGAGCAAGGGCGAGGAGCTGT-3′, RabA1b-4, 5′-TCCTCGCCCTTGCTCACCATCTCCGCCGTCTCCAGGTGGTTGCTT-3′, RabA1b-5, 5′-TGTACAAGGGAGGTAGTGGCATGGCAGGGTACAGAGTGGAAGATG-3′, and RabA1b-6, 5′-CCTGCCATGCCACTACCTCCCTTGTACAGCTCGTCCATGCCGTGA-3′. Confocal laser scanning microscopy images were taken with an Olympus FV10 ASW apparatus, and the most representative images are shown. Collages were assembled in Photoshop 7.
