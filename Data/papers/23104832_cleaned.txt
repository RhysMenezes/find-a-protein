!~ABS~! Eukaryotic organisms have evolved a set of strategies to safeguard genome integrity, but the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. Here, we report that ASYMMETRIC LEAVES1/2 ENHANCER7 (AE7), an Arabidopsis thaliana gene encoding a protein in the evolutionarily conserved Domain of Unknown Function 59 family, participates in the cytosolic iron-sulfur (Fe-S) cluster assembly (CIA) pathway to maintain genome integrity. The severe ae7-2 allele is embryo lethal, whereas plants with the weak ae7 (ae7-1) allele are viable but exhibit highly accumulated DNA damage that activates the DNA damage response to arrest the cell cycle. AE7 is part of a protein complex with CIA1, NAR1, and MET18, which are highly conserved in eukaryotes and are involved in the biogenesis of cytosolic and nuclear Fe-S proteins. ae7-1 plants have lower activities of the cytosolic [4Fe-4S] enzyme aconitase and the nuclear [4Fe-4S] enzyme DNA glycosylase ROS1. Additionally, mutations in the gene encoding the mitochondrial ATP binding cassette transporter ATM3/ABCB25, which is required for the activity of cytosolic Fe-S enzymes in Arabidopsis, also result in defective genome integrity similar to that of ae7-1. These results indicate that AE7 is a central member of the CIA pathway, linking plant mitochondria to nuclear genome integrity through assembly of Fe-S proteins.
!~RES~! We previously showed that AE7 expression was associated with proliferating cells in a pattern similar to that of the cell cycle marker gene HISTONE4 and that the DNA repair gene RAD51 was upregulated in the ae7 mutant (CITATION). To test whether AE7 is involved in DNA repair, we first examined the sensitivity of ae7 seedlings to DNA damage agents methyl methanesulfonate (MMS) and cisplatin. MMS is a DNA-alkylating agent and can cause DSBs (CITATION), whereas cisplatin is a cross-linking reagent that induces DNA lesions (CITATION). Compared with the wild type, the growth of ae7 seedlings was strongly compromised in the presence of MMS and cisplatin (Figures 1A to 1H). This sensitivity to DNA damage agents suggests that AE7 is involved in DNA replication and/or repair. [[FIGURE]] To gain direct evidence that ae7 carries increased DNA damage, we performed a comet assay to measure DNA breakage, using the first-pair leaves of 13-d-old ae7 seedlings. Because the extent of DNA damage differed from cell to cell even in the same plant, we classified the comet signals into four grades based on a ratio of signal intensities from the comet tail over the entire nucleus (Figure 1I). At the developmental stage examined, only weak DNA damage signals were detected in the wild-type leaves (Figures 1J and 1L), whereas not only was DNA damage more severe but also the number of cells containing damaged DNA markedly increased in the leaves of ae7 seedlings (Figures 1K and 1L). The results further indicate the role of AE7 in DNA replication and/or repair. In eukaryotic cells, DNA damage usually leads to activation of ATM/ATR-mediated signaling response cascades that turn on DNA repair machineries and arrest or delay cell cycle progression (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION; CITATION). Since DNA damage highly accumulated in the ae7 mutant, we next examined expression of several genes that are often induced in the DNA damage response. The tested genes included PARP genes that encode poly (ADP-ribose) polymerases required for the maintenance of DNA integrity during replication (CITATION), BREAST CANCER SUSCEPTIBILITY1 (BRCA1) and GAMMA RESPONSE1 (GR1) that are involved in DSB repair by the homologous recombination (HR) pathway (CITATION; CITATION), KU70, KU80, and LIGASE4 (LIG4) that are required for DSB repair by the nonhomologous end joining pathway (CITATION; CITATION), TSO2 that is activated in response to DSBs, and RIBONUCLEOTIDE REDUCTASE 2A (RNR2A) and RNR2B that are specifically induced by hydroxyurea (CITATION; CITATION). Our real-time quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) showed that among the genes tested, transcript levels of PARP1, PARP2, BRCA1, GR1, and TSO2 were elevated in ae7 (Figure 2A). [[FIGURE]] To understand better the functions of AE7, we backcrossed the ae7 mutant (Landsberg erecta [Ler]) to wild-type Columbia-0 (Col-0) five times and then introduced several marker lines that are in the Col-0 background into ae7-1 (for convenience, the backcrossed ae7 mutant was renamed ae7-1). Compared with wild-type plants (Figures 2B and 2D), the ae7 (Figure 2C) and ae7-1 (Figure 2E) plants displayed overall similar phenotypic abnormalities, with a smaller size and narrower, serrated leaves. Activation of the DNA damage response in the ae7-1 background was also confirmed by β-glucuronidase (GUS) staining of the pPARP2:GUS transgenic plants (CITATION): GUS staining appeared strongly in the shoot apex and young leaves of the ae7-1 seedlings (Figure 2G) but was barely detectable in the wild-type Col-0 (Figure 2F). To investigate whether the activated DNA damage response in ae7-1 leads to cell cycle arrest, we introduced a pCYCB1;1:Dbox-GUS construct (CYCB1;1-GUS) into ae7-1 plants by crossing. CYCB1;1 is activated in the G2 phase, and the CYCB1;1-GUS protein is degraded at metaphase; thus, GUS staining marks cells in the G2-to-M transition (CITATION; CITATION). Compared with the wild type (Figure 2H), GUS signals strongly accumulated in the shoot apex of ae7-1 (Figure 2I), indicating that ae7-1 mutation resulted in delayed or arrested transition of G2 to M phase. All of these results strongly suggest that the accumulated DNA damage causes activation of DNA damage responses in the ae7 mutants, leading to arrest of the cell cycle. In eukaryotes, DSBs are repaired in part via the HR pathway, which is important for maintaining genome integrity (CITATION). Given that ae7 seedlings are hypersensitive to DNA damaging agents, exhibited increased levels of DNA damage, and upregulated genes involved in HR-mediated DSB repair, we employed an HR repair assay, which allows recombination events to be visualized and scored by GUS histochemical staining (CITATION).The ae7-1 mutant was crossed to two HR reporter lines 1415 and 1406 (Col-0), which carry a T-DNA construct containing parts of the GUS gene with an overlapping sequence in a direct or inverted orientation, respectively. If an intrachromosomal recombination event occurs between the overlapping sequences, a functional GUS gene will be reconstituted and expressed; therefore, GUS staining in these lines reflects the frequency of intrachromosomal HR. Compared with line 1415 in the wild-type background (Figures 3A and 3B), a much greater number of GUS spots/patches were observed in the 1415/ae7-1 plants (Figures 3C and 3D). About 80% of the 1415/ae7-1 plants carried more than 20 GUS staining spots (Figure 3E) with an average of ∼43 per plant (Figure 3F). For 1406/ae7-1, ∼80% plants showed more than nine GUS spots (Figure 3G) with an average of ∼15 per plant (Figure 3H). By contrast, 1415 and 1406 in the wild-type background yielded far fewer GUS spots, with approximately eight and three per plant on average, respectively (Figures 3F and 3H). These results indicate that the ae7-1 mutation severely increased DSB events, leading to a higher frequency of intrachromosomal HR. [[FIGURE]] To provide additional evidence that accumulation of DNA damage stimulated intrachromosomal HR repair in ae7-1, we introduced the rad51d-2 mutation into the ae7-1 mutant by crossing. The RAD51D gene encodes a RecA/Rad51 family protein functioning in DNA recombination and repair and is required for somatic HR (CITATION). Although the rad51d-2 single mutant was indistinguishable from the wild-type plants (Figure 3I), the ae7-1 rad51d-2 double mutant displayed much stronger developmental defects than ae7-1, as shown by the reduced plant size (cf. Figures 3J and 2E). Compared with the wild-type plants, ∼20% of the ae7-1 rad51d-2 plants (33 out of 162) carried arrested leaf primordia (Figures 3K and 3L). Because RAD51D functions in the intrachromosomal HR repair pathway, it is likely that the enhanced ae7-1 rad51d-2 phenotypes are due to a strongly decreased efficiency of intrachromosomal HR repair. To test whether AE7 interacts with CIA1, NAR1, and MET18, as reported for the yeast and human homologs, we performed yeast two-hybrid assays with the Arabidopsis proteins. Yeast cells that coexpressed the AE7 bait and the CIA1 prey, the CIA1 bait and the NAR1 prey, or the AE7 bait and MET18 prey promoted the expression of the HIS3 and ADE2 reporter genes, allowing cells to grow on media lacking His and adenine (Figure 4A). However, an interaction between AE7 and NAR1was not detected using this assay (Figure 4A). [[FIGURE]] To confirm the protein–protein interaction between AE7 and CIA1, we performed a coimmunoprecipitation (Co-IP) assay. Tandem affinity protein (TAP)-tagged AE7 and FLAG-tagged CIA1 proteins were coexpressed transiently in the leaves of Nicotiana benthamiana, and the protein extracts were immunoprecipitated with IgG beads followed by immunoblotting analysis. The AE7-TAP protein but not TAP alone coprecipitated the FLAG-CIA1 protein (Figure 4B), suggesting that the AE7 protein was associated with CIA1 in planta. The AE7-CIA1 and AE7-MET18 interactions were also confirmed by bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) assays. Yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) fluorescence was observed in cells coinfiltrated with AE7-YN and CIA1-YC, or AE7-YN and the C-terminal domain of MET18 (MET18-C-YC), but not in cells with AE7-YN and YC, CIA1-YC and YN, or MET18-C-YC and YN (Figure 4C; data not shown for latter two combinations). Additionally, subcellular localization experiments revealed that the AE7-YFP, CIA1-mCherry, and MET18-mCherry fusion proteins were present in both nucleus and cytoplasm (see Supplemental Figure 1 online), further supporting the possibility that AE7, CIA1, and MET18 function in the same protein complex. The direct interactions between the Arabidopsis CIA members prompted us to investigate further whether the corresponding mutants display similar developmental defects. One Ds transposon insertional mutant heterozygous for AE7 (ae7-2), two T-DNA insertional mutants heterozygous for CIA1 (cia-1 and cia1-2), and another two T-DNA insertional mutants heterozygous for NAR1 (nar1-1 and nar1-2) were obtained (see Supplemental Figure 2 online). Because no homozygous plants were identified from the segregating population of any of these mutants, we examined seeds in the siliques of heterozygous plants. Aborted seeds were found among normal ones in a 1:3 ratio in each of these mutant alleles (104:308 for ae7-2+/−, 104:282 for cia1-1+/−, 111:331 for cia1-2+/−, 77:234 for nar1-1+/−, and 117:359 for nar1-2+/−) (Figures 5A to 5G). [[FIGURE]] To investigate the possible roles of AE7, CIA1, and NAR1 in embryonic development, we analyzed embryo phenotypes of the defective seeds from siliques of heterozygous mutant plants using Nomarski differential interference contrast microscopy. Different from those in the wild type (Figure 5H), the ae7-2 embryos displayed an irregular cell division pattern and arrested at the globular stage (Figure 5I). Compared with the wild-type embryos (Figure 5J), embryos of cia1-1 were arrested even earlier, resulting in a smaller apical part with abnormal shapes (Figure 5K). No embryo structure was observed in the aborted seeds of nar1-1 (Figure 5L), possibly due to defective cell division at the very early embryogenesis stage or gametophytic sterility. In contrast with AE7, CIA1, and NAR1, which are indispensable for Arabidopsis, phenotypes of two knockout mutant alleles of the single MET18 gene were indistinguishable from those of the wild type (Figures 5M and 5N compared with Figure 2D; see Supplemental Figure 2 online). To investigate a genetic interaction between AE7 and MET18, we crossed ae7-1 to met18-1 or met18-2. In the F2 progeny, plants with enhanced ae7-1 phenotypes were found, but genotyping analysis demonstrated that all the ae7-1 enhancer mutants were met18-1 ae7-1+/− or met18-2 ae7-1+/− plants (Figures 5O and 5P). In addition, the plants with ae7-1 phenotypes included ae7-1, met18-1+/− ae7-1, or met18-2+/− ae7-1, whereas met18 ae7-1 double mutant plants were not found in the F2 populations. We further analyzed the seeds in the siliques of met18-1+/− ae7-1 and met18-2+/− ae7-1 plants and found that about a quarter of seeds were aborted (Figures 5Q to 5T), indicating that met18 ae7-1 double homozygotes were not viable. To start our investigation into whether AE7 and its interaction partners in Arabidopsis play a role in Fe-S protein biogenesis, we performed yeast complementation assays. First, we tested whether AE7 is able to rescue a yeast cia2/yhr122w mutant, but introduction of AE7 into the yeast cells failed to rescue their growth on selective medium (see Supplemental Figure 3 online). At-CIA1 shares 37% identity and 53% similarity over the entire amino acid sequence with yeast Cia1, with seven conserved WD-40 repeats (see Supplemental Figure 4A online). Next, we tested At-CIA1 for complementation of the inducible Gal-CIA1 mutant in which the endogenous CIA1 promoter is replaced by the Gal-inducible GAL1-10 promoter. Because CIA1 is essential for yeast viability, the Gal-CIA1 cells were able to grow only on the Gal-containing medium (see Supplemental Figure 4B online, left panel). However, by shifting the cells from Gal to Glc as a sole carbon source, the endogenous Cia1 protein was depleted, and the cells carrying the empty vector p416 stopped growing, unless another copy of the yeast CIA1 gene, driven by a different promoter (p416-ScCIA1), was expressed. Growth of the Cia1-depleted cells could also be rescued by expression of the Arabidopsis homolog (p416-AtCIA1), although the growth was slower than with yeast CIA1 (see Supplemental Figure 4B online, right panel). Further biochemical analysis showed that the activities of two cytosolic [4Fe-4S] enzymes, isopropylmalate isomerase (Leu1) and sulfite reductase (SiR), were partially restored by expression of At-CIA1 (see Supplemental Figures 4C and 4D online). These results indicate that At-CIA1 is a functional ortholog of yeast Cia1. To investigate whether AE7 plays a role in the assembly of Fe-S proteins like its yeast homolog Cia2/YHR122W (CITATION), we analyzed activities of aconitases (ACOs) and aldehyde oxidases (AOs), which carry [4Fe-4S] and 2[2Fe-2S] clusters, respectively, in ae7-1 seedlings. Two prominent ACO activities were visualized by in-gel staining in the wild type, corresponding to the cytosolic and one of the mitochondrial isozymes (CITATION). Both activities were decreased in ae7-1 seedling extracts (Figure 6A, top panel), the cytosolic activity by 75% and the mitochondrial activity by 55% (see Supplemental Figure 5A online). The decreased levels of ACO activity were confirmed using cell fractionation and a photospectrometric assay (see Supplemental Figure 5B online). Levels of ACO protein were also diminished in ae7-1 (Figure 6A, second panel), as shown by protein blot analysis with specific antibodies against ACO (CITATION), but the transcript levels of ACO genes were not affected (see Supplemental Figure 6 online). These results indicate a posttranscriptional defect in ACO biogenesis, most likely a lack of Fe-S cluster assembly, which is known to destabilize the protein (CITATION). By contrast, the activities of AO isozymes were unchanged in the ae7-1 mutant, although a slight decrease of the upper activity was noticeable (Figure 6A, third panel). [[FIGURE]] Next, we performed a PCR assay to assess the demethylation activity of ROS1, a DNA glycosylase closely related to DEMETER for which 5-methylcytosine excision activity has been shown to depend on the [4Fe-4S] cluster ligands (CITATION). Genomic DNA from wild-type and ae7-1 leaves was digested with McrBC, which only cuts when methylated cytosines are present, followed by PCR with primer sets spanning two different loci known to be methylated (Figure 6B). The ROS1-dependent locus 3′ of At4g14365 (CITATION) was hypermethylated in ae7-1 compared with the wild type, based on the absence or presence, respectively, of a PCR product (Figure 6B, top panel). Similarly, the MRD1 coding sequence (At1g53480) was hypermethylated in ae7 mutants and in ros1-3, but not in the wild type (Figure 6B, third panel; CITATION). Control PCR reactions for undigested DNA or ACTIN confirmed that differences in the levels of PCR product were due to methylation status rather than DNA template concentration (Figure 6B, second, fourth, and fifth panels). Also, the levels of ROS1 expression were not affected at the mRNA level (see Supplemental Figure 6 online). The requirement of AE7 for the activity of at least two Fe-S enzymes indicates that the function of the CIA pathway is conserved in plants. To extend our knowledge of the Arabidopsis CIA pathway, we further analyzed phenotypes of atm3, as the Arabidopsis ortholog of yeast Atm1p is known to be critical for the activity of cytosolic Fe-S enzymes (CITATION; CITATION). We chose to focus our study on the weak atm3-4 allele, which has a similar reduction in growth as the weak ae7 alleles. Compared with that of the wild type, the number of palisade cells was reduced markedly, and CYCB1;1-GUS accumulated strongly in the atm3-4 leaves (see Supplemental Figures 7A to 7E online), similar to those of ae7-1 in which cell proliferation was defective. In addition, the ae7-1 atm3-4 double mutant displayed enhanced phenotypic abnormalities compared with either ae7-1 or atm3-4 single mutant, including diminutive plant size and serrated leaves (see Supplemental Figures 7F to 7I online). The phenotypic analysis strongly indicates a genetic interaction between AE7 and ATM3. Our expression analysis revealed that transcript levels of the DNA damage-inducible genes, including BRCA1, RAD51, PARP1, PARP2, and CYCB1;1, were elevated significantly in atm3-4 (Figure 7A), consistent with upregulation of RAD51 and PARP1 in sta1, another atm3 allele (CITATION). Additionally, atm3-4 seedlings were also hypersensitive to cisplatin (Figures 7B to 7E), similar to ae7 seedlings (Figures 1E to 1H). We also introduced atm3-4 into the HR marker lines 1415 and 1406. Compared with wild-type plants, the number of GUS-stained spots was increased for both the 1415/atm3-4 (Figures 7F to 7H) and 1406/atm3-4 (Figure 7I) plants. These results indicate that ATM3 function is also required for maintaining genome integrity. [[FIGURE]]
!~MM~! The ae7 mutant in Ler accession has been described previously (CITATION). This allele was backcrossed to wild-type Col-0 five times to generate ae7-1. Seeds of ae7-2 (GT6615), cia1-1 (SALK_060584), cia1-2 (CS16106), nar1-1 (GK_674D01), nar1-2 (GK_462G04), met18-1 (SALK_121963), met18-2 (SALK_147068), and rad51d-2 (SAIL_690_A08) were obtained from the European Arabidopsis Stock Centre or the ABRC. The primers used in PCR to identify insertional mutations are listed in Supplemental Table 1 online. Seeds of pCYCB1;1:Dbox-GUS/Col-0 (CITATION), pPARP2:GUS/Col-1 (CITATION), and HR marker lines 1415 and 1406 (CITATION) were kindly provided by Peter Doerner (University of Edinburgh, UK), Lieven De Veylder (Ghent University, Belgium), and Barbara Hohn (Friedrich Miescher Institute for Biomedical Research, Switzerland), respectively. Plants were grown in soil according to our previous conditions (CITATION). For seedlings grown on plates, surface-sterilized seeds were germinated in half-strength Murashige and Skoog medium supplemented with 1% Suc, kept at 4°C for 2 d, and then moved into a growth chamber with a 16-h-light and 8-h-dark regime at 22°C. Fresh seedlings and siliques from wild-type and mutant plants were examined using a SZH10 dissecting microscope (Nikon) and photographed using a Nikon E995 digital camera. Scanning electron microscopy, differential interference contrast microscopy, and GUS staining for pCYCB1;1:Dbox-GUS/Col-0 and pPARP2:GUS /Col-0 transgenic plants were performed according to our previous methods (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION; CITATION). GUS staining to detect intrachromosomal HR was performed as described previously (CITATION). For yeast two-hybrid assays, the coding sequences of AE7, CIA1, NAR1, MET18, and the N-terminal (MET18-N; amino acids 1 to 600) or C-terminal (MET18-C; amino acids 601 to 1134) sequence of MET18 were amplified by PCR. After verification of the sequences, the genes were subcloned into pGBK-T7 or pGAD-T7 (Clontech) to generate DNA binding or activation domain fusion constructs, respectively. The EcoRI and BamHI sites were used for cloning AE7, CIA1, and NAR1 into pGBK-T7 or pGAD-T7, but the NdeI and BamHI sites for MET18 and the NdeI and XhoI sites for MET18-N and MET18-C into pGAD-T7. For protein interaction analysis, two combinatory constructs were transformed simultaneously into the yeast strain AH109 (Clontech) and tested for Ade-, His-, Trp-, and Leu- auxotrophy according to the manufacturer’s protocols. For Co-IP, the coding regions of AE7 and CIA1 were fused to a DNA sequence encoding the TAP tag or the FLAG tag, respectively, and placed under the control of the 35S promoter. The resultant constructs p35S:AE7-TAP and p35S:FLAG-CIA1 were introduced into Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain GV3101 and then coinfiltrated into the leaves of 4-week-old Nicotiana benthamiana plants. IgG beads (Sigma-Aldrich) were used for capturing the protein complex from the total proteins prepared from the infiltrated leaves. The protein samples were analyzed on blots probed with the monoclonal anti-FLAG M2-peroxidase (horseradish peroxidase) antibody (Sigma-Aldrich; A8592) and peroxidase antiperoxidase soluble complex antibody (Sigma-Aldrich; P1291). Immunoreactive signals were revealed by chemiluminescence using Super Signal West Pico Chemiluminescent Substrate (Thermo Scientific). For the BiFC assays, the coding sequence of AE7 was fused in frame with the N-terminal fragment of YFP to generate p35S:AE7-YN. CIA1 or the C-terminal sequence (amino acids 601 to 1134) of MET18 was fused with the C-terminal fragment of YFP to generate p35S:CIA1-YC and p35S:MET18-C-YC, respectively. The resultant constructs were introduced into the leaves of N. benthamiana. After infiltration for 2 d, the epidermis of infiltrated leaves was examined for YFP signals under a Zeiss 510META confocal laser scanning microscope at a wavelength of 488 nm. For qRT-PCR, total RNA was extracted from 13-d-old seedlings using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen), and reverse transcription was performed with 3 μg total RNA using a kit (Fermentas). qRT-PCR was performed according to our previous methods (CITATION). For the McrBC-PCR assay, genomic DNA was extracted from leaf samples using the Qiagen Pure Gene kit. One microgram of DNA was mixed into a volume of 100 μL with restriction buffer, then split into 2 × 50 μL with either 2 μL McrBC enzyme (New England Biolabs) or 2 μL 2% (v/v) glycerol as control. After overnight digestion, a standard PCR was performed on 2 μL sample. The sequences of primers used for PCR are listed in Supplemental Table 1 online. The comet assay was performed as described previously (CITATION). The percentage of DNA in each comet tail was evaluated by comet-scoring software (http://www.autocomet.com). For chemical treatment, surface-sterilized seeds were germinated on agar containing different concentrations of MMS or cisplatin, kept at 4°C for 2 d, and then grown at 22°C for additional 16 d. The in-gel activity assays for AOs and ACO were performed as described previously (CITATION; CITATION). Protein samples were separated by standard SDS-PAGE (12%), transferred to nitrocellulose, and labeled with antisera against ACO (CITATION) or the mitochondrial marker protein Cox2 (Agrisera). The GAL-CIA1 mutant strain and the plasmids p416 and p416-ScCIA1 (CITATION) were kindly provided by R. Lill (University of Marburg, Germany). The coding sequence of At-CIA1 was subcloned into the EcoRI and SalI sites of the plasmid p416 to generate p416-AtCIA1. Cells were grown in rich (YP) or minimal (SC) medium containing Glc or Gal as carbon sources at a concentration of 2%. The yeast strain harboring a conditional (doxycycline-dependent) disruption in the CIA2/YHR122W gene (CITATION) was provided by Z. Li (Zhejiang University, China). The coding sequence of CIA2/YHR122W or AE7 was subcloned into the EcoRI and SpeI sites of the pESC-HIS plasmid (Stratagene) to generate FLAG fusion constructs and transformed into yeast. The expression of the endogenous CIA2/YHR122W gene was switched off by the addition of 10 μM/mL doxycycline.
