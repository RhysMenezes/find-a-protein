!~ABS~! Boron uptake in Arabidopsis thaliana is mediated by nodulin 26-like intrinsic protein 5;1 (NIP5;1), a boric acid channel that is located preferentially on the soil side of the plasma membrane in root cells. However, the mechanism underlying this polar localization is poorly understood. Here, we show that the polar localization of NIP5;1 in epidermal and endodermal root cells is mediated by the phosphorylation of Thr residues in the conserved TPG (ThrProGly) repeat in the N-terminal region of NIP5;1. Although substitutions of Ala for three Thr residues in the TPG repeat did not affect lateral diffusion in the plasma membrane, these substitutions inhibited endocytosis and strongly compromised the polar localization of GFP-NIP5;1. Consistent with this, the polar localization was compromised in µ subunit mutants of the clathrin adaptor AP2. The Thr-to-Ala substitutions did not affect the boron transport activity of GFP-NIP5;1 in Xenopus laevis oocytes but did inhibit the ability to complement boron translocation to shoots and rescue growth defects in nip5;1-1 mutant plants under boron-limited conditions. These results demonstrate that the polar localization of NIP5;1 is maintained by clathrin-mediated endocytosis, is dependent on phosphorylation in the TPG repeat, and is necessary for the efficient transport of boron in roots.
!~RES~! To identify amino acid residues required for the polar localization of NIP5;1, we first compared the localization of NIPs in Arabidopsis. Previously, NIP5;1 (CITATION) and NIP6;1 (CITATION) were reported to be localized primarily in the PM, whereas NIP1;1 and NIP2;1 were located both in the PM and in intracellular membranes, most likely the endoplasmic reticulum (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION). To compare localization in the same cell types without the influence of native NIP5;1, GFP-fused proteins were expressed under control of the NIP5;1 promoter in the nip5;1-1 mutant throughout this study. In epidermal cells, GFP-NIP1;2, GFP-NIP5;1, and GFP-NIP6;1 were localized mainly in the PM (Supplemental Figure 1). GFP-NIP1;1, GFP-NIP2;1, and GFP-NIP4;1 were localized in both the PM and intracellular compartments, presumably in endoplasmic reticulum membranes, and GFP-NIP3;1 and GFP-NIP7;1 were localized in intracellular compartments (Supplemental Figure 1). We next investigated whether GFP-NIP1;2 and GFP-NIP6;1 showed polar localizations in the PM by comparing their signals with those of FM4-64, a lipophilic styryl dye considered to stain the PM in a nonpolar manner (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION). The GFP signals of GFP-NIP5;1 and GFP-NIP6;1 were clearly polarized toward the soil side in epidermal cells (Figure 1A). By contrast, the localization of GFP-NIP1;2 showed only a weakly polar localization in the optical longitudinal section. Signal intensities from different positions in the longitudinal optical section are affected by the reduction of light penetration of the tissue. It should also be noted that the degree of reduction is dependent on wavelength. Indeed, when PM markers YFP-NSPN12 and mCherry-NPSN12 were expressed under control of the UBQ10 promoter in the same root, YFP signals showed slightly more polarized distribution toward the soil side than mCherry signals (Supplemental Figure 2A). [[FIGURE]] Therefore, we also used cross sections to evaluate polar localization (Figure 1A). Again, the localizations of GFP-NIP5;1 and GFP-NIP6;1 were clearly polar, whereas that of GFP-NIP1;2 was weakly polar. To evaluate the polar localization quantitatively, we defined the polarity index (PI) as follows. In longitudinal optical sections of Arabidopsis roots, the PI represents the ratio of GFP signals normalized by FM4-64 signals of the soil-side half versus the stele-side half (Figure 1C, PILongitudinal) (CITATION). In the cross sections, the PI represents the ratio of GFP signal intensity of the soil-side versus the stele-side portions (Figure 1D, PICross). Therefore, a PI of 1.0 represents a nonpolar localization with an equal amount of protein in the two halves/portions. The PILongitudinal values for GFP-NIP5;1 and GFP-NIP6;1 were ∼3.8 and ∼3.3, and those of PICross were ∼11.5 and ∼5.4, respectively (Figures 1C and 1D), showing preferential localization on the outermost, soil-facing side of the root cells. By contrast, the PILongitudinal value for GFP-NIP1;2 was ∼1.5 and the PICross value was ∼2.0 (Figures 1C and 1D). These values were lower than those for GFP-NIP5;1, but still >1.0, representing a weak polar localization favoring the soil side. To examine whether this weak polar localization of NIP1;2 is common for membrane proteins in the PM of epidermal cells, we observed and quantified the localization of several PM markers normally expected to be nonpolar. For this purpose, GFP-tagged LTI6a, a small hydrophobic protein with two potential transmembrane domains (TMDs) (CITATION); GFP-tagged NPSN12, a plant-specific SNARE with one TMD (CITATION); and GFP-tagged PIP2;1, a water channel (CITATION), were expressed in the nip5;1-1 mutant under the control of the NIP5;1 promoter. As with GFP-NIP1;2, these PM markers showed reduced signals from the soil side to the stele side in the transverse PM domain compared with the FM4-64 signals and the PILongitudinal values were ∼1.5 (Figures 1A and 1C). In cross sections, intensities of the GFP signal were higher in the soil-side PM domain and PICross values were 1.3 to 2.5 (Figures 1A and 1D), values that were similar to those of GFP-NIP1;2. The GFP-LTI6a and GFP-NPSN12 fusions showed weak expression in the cortical cells even under the control of the NIP5;1 promoter. Thus, the PICross values of GFP-LTI6a and GFP-NPSN12 in the epidermal cells are likely underestimates. In addition to GFP-fused PM markers, mCherry-NPSN12 under control of the UBQ10 promoter and PIP2;1-mCherry under control of the CaMV 35S promoter also showed weakly polar localization in epidermal cells in the cross section (Supplemental Figures 2B and 2C). These results suggest that weak polar localization toward the soil side is an inherent feature of membrane proteins on the PM of the epidermal cells. For simplicity, we classify GFP-NIP1;2, GFP-PIP2;1, GFP-LTI6a, and GFP-NPSN12 as general PM markers in this study. Considering the high sequence similarity in the central region from the first to the sixth TMDs and the lower conservation in the cytosolic N- and C-terminal regions among the NIPs (Supplemental Figure 3A), we hypothesized that the N- or the C-terminal region of NIP5;1 is probably responsible for the polar localization. To test this, we generated three chimeric constructs by swapping the corresponding N-terminal region (Nt), C-terminal region, and the TMD-containing central region from NIP5;1 and NIP1;2, and tagged them with GFP at the N terminus (Figure 1B). The chimera GFP-NIP5;1-Ct1;2, in which the C-terminal region of NIP5;1 was replaced with that of NIP1;2, showed PILongitudinal and PICross values of 2.1 and 4.4, respectively (Figures 1C and 1D). The chimera GFP-Nt5;1-TMD1;2-Ct5;1, in which the TMD-containing central region of NIP5;1 was replaced with that of NIP1;2, showed PILongitudinal and PICross values of 2.3 and 7.2, respectively (Figures 1C and 1D). These values were significantly higher than those for GFP-NIP1;2 (P < 0.01, Student’s t test). By contrast, the chimera GFP-Nt1;2-NIP5;1, in which the Nt of NIP5;1 was replaced with that of NIP1;2, was localized in the PM in a manner similar to the general PM markers (Figure 1B), with PILongitudinal and PICross values of 1.5 and 2.1, respectively (Figures 1C and 1D). These results indicated that the N-terminal region of NIP5;1 was required for the polar localization. We then investigated whether the N-terminal region of NIP5;1 was sufficient to confer polar localization on either its homolog NIP1;2 or the water channel PIP2;1. For this, we generated chimeric constructs by replacing the Nt region of NIP1;2 or PIP2;1 with that of NIP5;1, and we then tested the localization of the respective proteins in the nip5;1-1 mutant (Figure 1B). The GFP-Nt5;1-NIP1;2, in which Nt of NIP1;2 was replaced with that of NIP5;1, showed a clear polar distribution, with PILongitudinal and PICross values of 2.1 and 8.4, respectively (Figures 1B to 1D). Likewise, the GFP-Nt5;1-PIP2;1, in which Nt of PIP2;1 was replaced with that of NIP5;1, also displayed clear polar localization, with PILongitudinal and PICross values of 2.7 and 9.4, respectively (Figures 1B to 1D). These values were significantly higher than those of GFP-NIP1;2 or GFP-PIP2;1 (P < 0.01, Student’s t test), indicating that the N-terminal region of NIP5;1 is sufficient to establish polar localization of aquaporin homologs. Although the amino acid sequences of the N-terminal regions of Arabidopsis NIPs vary (Supplemental Figure 3A), there is a characteristic pattern in NIP5;1 and NIP6;1 that is not present in other NIPs in Arabidopsis: the TPGTPGTPG sequence at positions 18 to 26 of NIP5;1 and the TPGTPG sequence at positions 16 to 21 of NIP6;1 (Figure 2A). Os-NIP3;1 and Zm-NIP3;1, the rice and maize orthologs of Arabidopsis NIP5;1, respectively, are boric acid channels (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION). Alignment of their N-terminal regions showed that they share the TPGTPG/A sequence (Supplemental Figure 3B). TPGTPG/A or similar sequences in the N-terminal region were identified in AtNIP5;1 homologs in various plant species (CITATION; CITATION). [[FIGURE]] To test the importance of this conserved sequence in polar localization, we analyzed the localization of GFP-NIP5;1 variants in which 17 (∆Nt1–17) or 26 (∆Nt1–26) amino acids from the N terminus were deleted. The GFP-NIP5;1∆Nt1–17 variant, which retains the TPG repeat, showed polar localization (Figure 2B), although PIs were lower than that of the wild-type construct (Figure 2E). The GFP-NIP5;1∆Nt1–26 variant, which does not contain the TPG repeat, showed significantly lower PI values than those of the wild type and the ∆Nt1–17 variant (Figures 2B and 2E), although the PI values were a little higher than those of general PM markers (Figure 1). These results show that the TPG repeat is required for the polar localization of NIP5;1. The GFP-NIP5;1∆Nt1–17 and GFP-NIP5;1∆Nt1–26 variants were observed in punctate structures in cells in addition to the PM (Supplemental Figures 4B and 4C). To test whether a significant proportion of the variants was transported to endosomes and the vacuole, we imaged the cells after dark treatment. In the dark, GFP in the vacuole is relatively resistant to degradation (CITATION). Following a dark treatment for 8 h, a large fraction of GFP-NIP5;1∆Nt1–17 and GFP-NIP5;1∆Nt1–26 variants was observed in the vacuole (Supplemental Figures 4E and 4F), suggesting that the N-terminal 17 amino acid sequence is important for retaining the protein in the PM. We focused on the Thr residues in the conserved TPG repeat because these have been predicted to be phosphorylation sites (CITATION; CITATION). To investigate phosphorylation of these residues, a polyclonal antibody was generated against an artificial peptide of the NIP5;1 N-terminal region containing three phospho-Thr residues (T18/T21/T24). GFP-NIP5;1 variants, in which either one or all three Thr residues at positions 18, 21, and/or 24 (Figure 2A) were substituted by Ala, were expressed in the nip5;1-1 mutant under control of the NIP5;1 promoter. For immunoblotting, we prepared immunoprecipitated samples containing GFP-NIP5;1 wild type and variants to reduce nonspecific binding. Using an anti-GFP antibody, GFP-NIP5;1 wild type and variants were detected as bands at ∼50, ∼100, ∼130, ∼190, and ∼270 kD (Figure 2C). Considering the predicted molecular mass of GFP-NIP5;1 (58.5 kD) and that the functional form of aquaporins is a tetramer (CITATION), we suggest that these bands include monomer, dimer, trimer, tetramer, and unknown modified forms. Using the phospho-Thr NIP5;1 antibody, these forms of wild-type GFP-NIP5;1 protein were detected, whereas those of the T18A·T21A·T24A variant were not (Figure 2C). The wild-type signals disappeared after lambda phosphatase treatment (Figure 2C), indicating that the antibody recognized GFP-NIP5;1 in which the TPG repeat is present in a phosphorylated state. The GFP-NIP5;1 T18A and T24A proteins were detected prominently, but less efficiently than wild-type proteins, whereas the T21A variants were not. These results indicate that NIP5;1 is phosphorylated at conserved Thr residue(s) in vivo and that Thr-21 is especially important in this respect. It should be noted that this approach does not unambiguously determine the phosphorylated Thr residue(s) in the TPG repeat in the wild type because Ala substitution has the potential to affect the phosphorylation of neighboring Thr residues. To assess whether Thr residue phosphorylation was involved in the polar localization of NIP5;1 in the PM, we investigated both the localization of the phosphomimetic mutant GFP-NIP5;1 T18D·T21D·T24D, in which Thr residues at positions 18, 21, and 24 were replaced with Asp, and the localization of the nonphosphorylatable mutant GFP-NIP5;1 T18A·T21A·T24A in epidermal cells. The localization pattern of GFP-NIP5;1 T18D·T21D·T24D was similar to that of wild-type GFP-NIP5;1 (PILongitudinal value, 3.4; PICross value, 9.0; Figures 2D and 2E), whereas GFP-NIP5;1 T18A·T21A·T24A showed a marked loss in polar localization (PILongitudinal value, 1.5; PICross value, 2.1; Figures 2D and 2E). These results indicate the importance of the Thr residues in the TPG repeat for the polar localization. We next investigated the effects of substitution in cell types other than epidermal cells. In transgenic plants with relatively strong expression, we detected the expression of GFP-NIP5;1 in mature endodermal cells (Figure 2F). As reported previously, the FM4-64 signal was localized exclusively on the soil-side PM domain due to blocked diffusion in both the apoplast and the PM by the Casparian strips (Figure 2F; CITATION). Wild-type GFP-NIP5;1 was observed only on the soil-side PM domain, decorated with FM4-64, whereas the T18A·T21A·T24A variant was observed in both the soil-side and the stele-side PM domains in the endodermis (Figure 2F). Imaging of the cross section supported this. These results suggested a common mechanism regulating the polar localization of NIP5;1 in epidermal and endodermal cells, independent of the presence of a diffusion barrier (Casparian strips) in the PM. We also investigated the localization of the single Ala-substituted variants, T18A, T21A, and T24A. Each Ala substitution affected polar localization to a different degree (Figures 2D and 2E). The T21A variant showed the lowest PI, although still higher than the T18A·T21A·T24A triple substitution variant. Together with the finding that T18A and T24A variants, but not the T21A variant, were detected by the phospho-Thr NIP5;1 antibody (Figure 2C), these results suggest a correlation between phosphorylation status and the degree of polar localization. To examine whether Thr residue phosphorylation was also important for the polar localization of NIP6;1, we focused on T15, T16, and T19, residues predicted to be putative phosphorylation sites according to the PhosPhAt database (CITATION). In contrast to the polar localization of wild-type GFP-NIP6;1, the T15A·T16A·T19A variant lost its polar localization (Supplemental Figure 5A). The PILongitudinal and PICross values were 1.3 and 1.6 (Supplemental Figure 5B), which were similar to those obtained with the general PM markers (Figures 1B and 1C). Similar to the case of NIP5;1, single substitutions of these Thr residues (at positions 15, 16, and 19) with Ala affected the polar localization of GFP-NIP6;1 to differing extents (Supplemental Figures 5A and 5B). These findings indicate the common importance of conserved Thr residues in the TPG repeats for polar localization of NIP5;1 and NIP6;1 in the PM. Next, we investigated time-dependent changes in the localization of newly synthesized GFP-NIP5;1 under control of the NIP5;1 promoter and the 5′-UTR by transferring plants from high (100 µM) to low (0.3 µM) boron conditions (Supplemental Figure 6). The 5′-UTR of NIP5;1 helps to regulate mRNA degradation, depending on boron conditions (CITATION, CITATION). The signals of wild-type GFP-NIP5;1 in the PM were detectable after 1.5 h under low-boron conditions and the pattern was already polar at this point (Supplemental Figure 6). The intensity of wild-type GFP-NIP5;1 on the soil side, but not on the stele side, increased continuously for 24 h. By contrast, the intensity of GFP-NIP5;1 T18A·T21A·T24A increased on both sides and showed consistently weak polar localization for 24 h (Supplemental Figure 6). These results support our findings that phosphorylation of the Thr residues in the conserved TPG repeat is important in establishing the polar localization of NIP5;1. Polar localization in the PM can be generated and maintained by polar trafficking, including secretion and endocytic recycling, and/or retention in specific membrane domains. To examine the effects of phosphorylation on the dynamics of NIP5;1 within and around the PM, we performed fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) analyses on the soil-side PM surface of root epidermal cells. To inhibit de novo synthesis of GFP-NIP5;1, we applied cycloheximide (CHX; 50 µM) at 30 min prior to the FRAP analyses. We confirmed that CHX treatment inhibited the new synthesis of GFP-NIP5;1 effectively (Supplemental Figure 7). In the FRAP analysis, wild-type GFP-NIP5;1 and the T18A·T21A·T24A variant showed comparable fluorescence recovery up to 30 min (Figure 3A). We then examined the fluorescence recovery at the center and periphery of the bleached area. The rates of recovery at 30 min were significantly lower at the center than at the periphery for both GFP-NIP5;1 and T18A·T21A·T24A proteins (Figure 3B). These results suggest that lateral diffusion contributed significantly to fluorescence recovery of the wild-type GFP-NIP5;1 and T18A·T21A·T24A proteins under these experimental conditions. [[FIGURE]] To further compare the lateral diffusion of wild-type GFP-NIP5;1 and the T18A·T21A·T24A variant, we used sodium azide (NaN3; 0.02%) together with CHX (50 µM) for 30 min prior to FRAP analysis. NaN3 blocks hydrolysis by the mitochondrial ATPase and thus is used as an energy inhibitor. Under these conditions, endocytosis of FM4-64 was inhibited effectively, compared with the control condition (Figure 3C). To estimate the rate of lateral diffusion precisely at the PM surface, changes in the signal ratios for a region around (X) and precisely at the bleached region (Y) in the presence of CHX alone or in combination with NaN3 were calculated (Figure 3D). The signal ratio, X/Y, was not affected significantly by NaN3 treatment and showed no significant difference at any time point between the wild-type GFP-NIP5;1 and T18A·T21A·T24A proteins (Figure 3D). These results indicated both that the rate of lateral diffusion in the PM was similar for the wild-type GFP-NIP5;1 and T18A·T21A·T24A proteins and that the impact of recycling is of little significance, at least within 30 min. Thus, it seems likely that phosphorylation of the Thr residues in the TPG repeat is not involved in retention in a PM domain. To assess whether Thr residue phosphorylation was involved in vesicle trafficking, we used BFA, an inhibitor that enables the visualization of internalized PM proteins by inhibiting their recycling to the PM (CITATION; CITATION). To reduce accumulation of de novo synthesized proteins, we treated roots with CHX (50 µM) for 30 min and then with BFA (50 µM) and CHX (50 µM) for 60 min. Consistent with a previous report, BFA caused the formation of aggregates containing GFP-NIP5;1 in root epidermal cells (Figures 4A and 4B; CITATION). The rate of intracellular accumulation (CITATION) of GFP-NIP5;1 protein was increased, from 6.9 to 12.8%, by BFA treatment in the presence of CHX (Figure 4E). Pretreatment with CHX did not decrease the accumulation of GFP-NIP5;1 significantly in cells compared with treatment with BFA alone (Figures 4C and 4E, P < 0.01, Student’s t test), suggesting that GFP-NIP5;1 in the aggregates is transferred mainly from the PM. By contrast, the T18A·T21A·T24A variant accumulated little in the BFA-induced aggregates (Figures 4B and 4E), whereas GFP-NIP5;1 T18D·T21D·T24D was accumulated in the aggregates and the rate of intracellular accumulation increased, from 8.1 to 12.2%, by BFA treatment (Figures 4B and 4E). These results suggest that phosphorylation of the Thr residues in the TPG repeat accelerated the endocytosis of NIP5;1. [[FIGURE]] Clathrin-mediated endocytosis is a major endocytic pathway in Arabidopsis (CITATION; CITATION). A heterotetrameric adaptor protein complex, AP2, which is conserved in eukaryotes, is important for clathrin-mediated endocytosis in Arabidopsis (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION; CITATION). To determine whether clathrin-mediated endocytosis contributed to the polar localization of GFP-NIP5;1 in the PM, we investigated the localization of GFP-NIP5;1 in T-DNA insertion mutants of the µ subunit of the AP2 complex (AP2M). In the ap2m-1 and ap2m-2 mutants, GFP-NIP5;1 did not accumulate significantly in BFA-induced aggregates in root epidermal cells (Figures 4D and 4E), indicating a low rates of endocytosis. The patterns of GFP-NIP5;1 localization in the epidermal cells of ap2m-1 and ap2m-2 mutants showed a strongly compromised polar distribution with PILongitudinal values of 1.6 and 2.0 and PICross values of 2.8 and 2.7, respectively (Figure 5; Supplemental Figure 8). These results demonstrate that clathrin-mediated endocytosis is required for maintenance of the polar localization of NIP5;1 in the PM. [[FIGURE]] To investigate the physiological significance of the polar localization of NIP5;1 on plant growth, we tested whether the mutation affected the boric acid transport activity of NIP5;1. For this, we injected cRNAs of wild-type GFP-NIP5;1 and the T18A·T21A·T24A variant into Xenopus laevis oocytes to conduct a boric acid uptake assay (CITATION; CITATION). We also used cRNA of GFP-tagged NIP1;2, which has a different type of aromatic/arginine selectivity filter from NIP5;1 and NIP6;1 and thus is not expected to transport boric acid effectively (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION). Identical amounts of cRNAs were injected into the oocytes and similar GFP levels were observed in the PM (Figure 6A). The oocytes were incubated in MBS buffer containing 5 mM boric acid for 30 min and the boron concentration was analyzed by inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). GFP-NIP5;1-expressing oocytes accumulated 2.7- and 1.9-fold higher boron contents than water-injected controls and the GFP-NIP1;2-expressing oocytes, respectively (Figure 6B). As expected, the boron contents of oocytes with wild-type GFP-NIP5;1 and T18A·T21A·T24A did not differ significantly (Figure 6B), indicating that substitution of the Thr residues did not disturb NIP5;1 boron transport activity. [[FIGURE]] We then investigated the physiological significance of the polar localization in transgenic Arabidopsis plants. It was reported previously that the ProNIP5;1:sGFP-NIP5;1(cDNA) construct did not fully complement the growth defects of the nip5;1-1 mutant plant under boron limitation, probably due to low expression levels (CITATION; CITATION). Thus, we tested the ProNIP5;1:GFP-NIP5;1(genomic) construct containing a 5′-UTR and the genomic sequence of NIP5;1 from the start codon to the end of the 3′-UTR and its T18A·T21A·T24A variant introduced into a nip5;1-1 background. We measured the mRNA levels and protein levels based on GFP signal intensities in T3 homozygous lines with single insertions (Figures 7A and 7B). For growth analysis, we selected three lines of GFP-NIP5;1(genomic) wild-type (#3, 6, and 7) and two lines of GFP-NIP5;1(genomic) T18A·T21A·T24A (#5 and 10) with similar mRNA and GFP levels. We also selected two lines with higher expression of GFP-NIP5;1 T18A·T21A·T24A (#1 and 12). These lines showed expression and localization patterns of wild-type GFP-NIP5;1 and T18A·T21A·T24A in epidermal cells and mature endodermal cells, similar to the patterns in the lines containing the cDNA construct (Supplemental Figure 9; compared with Figures 1A, 2D, and 2F). Using these lines, we characterized complementation of growth of the nip5;1-1 mutant by GFP-NIP5;1 variants under low-boron conditions (Figures 7C and 7D; Supplemental Figure 10). When boron in the medium was increased from 0.03 to 3 µM, Col-0 plants showed improved root and shoot growth. The nip5;1-1 plants also showed growth improvement with increased boron supply, whereas the growth was retarded severely versus Col-0 even at 3 µM boron, as reported previously (CITATION). Under these conditions, transgenic nip5;1-1 lines expressing wild-type GFP-NIP5;1 developed similar or slightly longer primary roots and similar or slightly heavier shoot weights, relative to Col-0, indicating full complementation (Figures 7C and 7D; Supplemental Figure 10). By contrast, the GFP-NIP5;1 T18A·T21A·T24A variant did not fully complement the growth defects of the nip5;1-1 mutant. At 0.03 µM boron, the primary root lengths and shoot fresh weights of GFP-NIP5;1 T18A·T21A·T24A lines were 73 to 87% and only 38 to 47%, respectively, relative to Col-0 (Figures 7C and 7D). At 3 µM boron, the primary root lengths and shoot fresh weights of GFP-NIP5;1 T18A·T21A·T24A lines reached levels similar to those of Col-0, although lines #1, 5, and 12 still showed significantly lower values (P < 0.01, Student’s t test; Figures 7C and 7D). The lines with higher expression of GFP-NIP5;1 T18A·T21A·T24A (#1 and 12) did not grow better than the lines with moderate expression (#5 and 10). In summary, the wild-type GFP-NIP5;1 protein was able to complement fully the growth defects of the nip5;1-1 mutant, whereas the nonphosphorylatable T18A·T21A·T24A variant was not. [[FIGURE]] To examine the physiological significance of the polar localization on boron transport, a tracer experiment was conducted using transgenic plants with similar expression levels of wild-type GFP-NIP5;1 (#3 and 6) and the T18A·T21A·T24A variant (#5 and 10). Plants grown hydroponically with 100 µM 11B-enriched boric acid were divided into two pools. One was incubated with 1 µM 10B-enriched boric acid for 24 h, and the other was harvested as a control. The 10B concentration in each sample was determined by ICP-MS, and 10B transported into the shoot during the 24-h period was calculated as a function of root weight. The amount of 10B transported to the shoot in Col-0 during the 24-h period was about 3 times higher than that in the nip5;1-1 mutant (Figure 7E) and the amount in the transgenic nip5;1-1 lines with wild-type GFP-NIP5;1 was 5 to 29% higher than in Col-0. This was likely caused by higher expression of GFP-NIP5;1 mRNA, relative to endogenous NIP5;1 (Figure 7A). In the transgenic lines with GFP-NIP5;1 T18A·T21A·T24A, 10B transport was 27 to 30% lower than in the Col-0. Together, these results indicate that the polar localization of NIP5;1 supported the efficient transport of boron in roots under low-boron conditions.
!~MM~! Arabidopsis thaliana Col-0 was from our laboratory stock. The T-DNA insertion mutants nip5;1-1 (SALK_122287; CITATION), ap2m-1 (SALK_08393; CITATION), and ap2m-2 (SAIL_165_A05; CITATION) were described previously. The nip5;1-1 mutant was used for transformation by the Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated in planta method (CITATION). Plasmid vectors described in the next section were introduced into Agrobacterium strain GV3101::pMP90. T1 plants were selected on half-strength Murashige and Skoog medium supplemented with 20 µM hygromycin boron. Then, plants were transferred to medium without antibiotics and GFP expression was confirmed by fluorescence microcopy. T3 homozygous lines with single insertions of wild-type ProNIP5;1:GFP-NIP5;1(genomic) and the T18A·T21A·T24A variant were established based on segregation analysis on medium with hygromycin boron. T3 homozygous lines harboring ProNIP5;1(without 5′-UTR):GFP-NIP5;1 (CITATION) were provided by Mayuki Tanaka (The University of Tokyo). ap2m-1 or ap2m-2 homozygous plants expressing GFP-NIP5;1 were selected from F2 populations derived from the cross of ProNIP5;1(without 5′-UTR):GFP-NIP5;1/nip5;1 and ap2m-1 or ap2m-2 mutants by fluorescence imaging and genotyping using the primers in Supplemental Table 2. For imaging and growth analyses, seeds were sown on solid medium (CITATION), supplemented with 1% (w/v) sucrose, 1.5% (w/v) gellan gum (Wako Pure Chemicals), and various concentrations of boric acid. Purified water was produced using a Milli-Q Advantage A10 purification system (Millipore). Plates were placed vertically in growth chambers at 22°C under a cycle of 18 h light and 6 h dark. For imaging, unless otherwise indicated, plants were supplemented with 10 µM boric acid and grown for 3 to 4 d. For growth analysis, photos of 1-week-old plants supplemented with 0.03, 0.1, 1.0, or 3.0 µM boric acid were taken and root lengths were measured using the RootNav software (CITATION). Sequences of primers used for plasmid construction are listed in Supplemental Table 2. For the ProNIP5;1:sGFP-NIP5;1(genomic) construct, a PCR fragment containing the NIP5;1 genomic sequence from the start codon to the end of the 3′-UTR was fused to a PCR fragment containing ProNIP5;1:sGFP that was amplified from ProNIP5;1:sGFP-NIP5;1 (CITATION) using the In-Fusion HD cloning kit (Takara Clontech). To generate the ProNIP5;1:sGFP-NIP5;1(genomic) T18A·T21A·T24A construct, a pair of specific primers containing nucleotide substitutions was used to perform PCR using the ProNIP5;1:sGFP-NIP5;1(genomic) construct as a template. The 5′ and 3′ ends of PCR products were fused using the In-Fusion HD cloning kit. Similarly, the ProNIP5;1:sGFP-NIP5;1(genomic) T18D·T21D·T24D construct was generated using specific primers containing nucleotide substitutions. The nucleotides altered to create amino acid substitutions are underlined in Supplemental Table 2. For high-throughput analysis of the localization of NIPs in the root epidermal cells, we generated a Gateway destination vector (Invitrogen) containing the NIP5;1 promoter and sGFP. The Gateway vector pGWB506 containing the cauliflower mosaic virus 35S (CaMV35S) promoter and sGFP for N-terminal fusion (CITATION) was digested with restriction enzymes HindIII and XbaI (Takara-Bio) to remove the promoter sequence. A PCR fragment containing a 2180-bp NIP5;1 promoter sequence was amplified using Col-0 genomic DNA as a template and was digested with HindIII and XbaI. This NIP5;1 promoter fragment was ligated with the digested pGWB506 to generate the ProNIP5;1:sGFP destination vector. To make entry vectors, the open reading frame (ORF) of NIP7;1 was amplified from cDNA generated from RNA of Col-0 flowers, and other NIPs and PIP2;1 were amplified from cDNAs generated from RNA of Col-0 roots using the One-Step RT-PCR kit (Qiagen) with specific primers. Then, the ORFs of interest were subcloned into the pENTR/D-TOPO vector by TOPO cloning (Invitrogen). For chimeric constructs, PCR fragments of NIP1;2, NIP5;1, and PIP2;1 and a pENTR/D-TOPO backbone were amplified from the entry vectors pENTR/D-TOPO NIP1;2 and pENTR/D-TOPO PIP2;1 using specific primers containing overlapping sequences. The amplified PCR fragments were then fused using the In-Fusion HD cloning kit. The Gateway LR reaction (Invitrogen) was performed between the entry vectors (pENTR/D-TOPO background) and the ProNIP5;1:sGFP destination vector to obtain expression constructs. For the expression of GFP-NIP5;1 ∆Nt1–17, ∆Nt1–26, T18A·T21A·T24A, T18D·T21D·T24D, T18A, T21A, and T24A variants, constructs were generated by PCR using specific primers and the In-Fusion HD cloning kit, based on the ProNIP5;1:sGFP-NIP5;1 vector (CITATION). To construct ProNIP5;1:sGFP-NIP6;1, the backbone sequence containing ProNIP5;1 and sGFP was amplified from the ProNIP5;1:sGFP-NIP5;1 vector and fused with a PCR fragment of NIP6;1 ORF using the In-Fusion HD cloning kit. Similarly, ProNIP5;1:sGFP-NPSN12 and ProNIP5;1:sGFP-LTI6a were generated using the NPSN12 and Lti6a PCR fragments that were amplified from GFP-LTI6a- and mCherry-NPSN12-containing plasmids (CITATION; CITATION). Constructs to express the GFP-NIP6;1 T15A·T16A·T19A, T16A, and T19A variants were generated by PCR using the ProNIP5;1:sGFP-NIP6;1 vector as a template and specific primers containing nucleotide substitutions and were fused with the In-Fusion HD cloning kit. The plasmids used for expression in Xenopus laevis oocytes were constructed as follows. The ORFs of NIPs N-terminally fused to GFP were amplified by PCR using specific primers containing BamHI restriction sites at both 5′ ends. The PCR products were digested with BamHI and subcloned into the pXβG-ev1 oocyte expression vector (CITATION; CITATION) that had been digested with BglII. Sequences of PCR fragments, including promoters, coding sequences, and untranslated regions of genes, were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Plants were grown on solid medium containing 100 µM boron for 11 d and shifted to medium containing 0.3 µM boron for 24 h. Total RNA was extracted using the RNeasy plant mini kit and treated with DNase I (Qiagen). Total RNA (1 µg) was reverse transcribed to cDNA in a 20-μL reaction using the SuperScript III first-strand synthesis system (Invitrogen) with oligo-d(T)20 primers. Real-time PCR was performed using a Roche LightCycler 480 real-time System (Roche) and the LightCycler 480 SYBR Green I Master kit. The UBQ5 gene was used as an internal control for quantification. The primers used are listed in Supplemental Table 2. A Leica TCS-SP5 confocal laser scanning microscope and the TCS-SP8 system were used for imaging with the following set of excitation/detection wavelengths: GFP (488 nm/505–540 nm) and FM4-64 (488 nm/640–750 nm). Plants were grown for 3 to 4 d on vertically placed solid medium before use. Unless otherwise indicated, FM4-64 (Molecular Probes) was used at 4 µM in liquid medium for 30 min prior to imaging to label membranes. To quantify the polarity index in the transverse PM domain in longitudinal optical sections (PILongitudinal values), ImageJ software (NIH, http://imagej.nih.gov/ij/) was used to measure the mean value of GFP and FM 4-64 intensities in the soil- and stele-side halves or the transverse PM domain (CITATION; Figure 1C). GFP intensity, normalized by FM4-64 on the soil side, was divided by GFP intensity, normalized by FM4-64 on the stele side. For cross sections, plant roots were embedded in medium solidified with 2.5% (w/v) gellan gum (Wako Pure Chemical) and cut with layered razor blades. To quantify the polarity index in the lateral domain in cross sections (PICross), a line 2 µm wide was set to cross the outer- and innermost portions of epidermal cells (Figure 1D). GFP fluorescence intensity in a 2 × 2-µm region including the PM at the outermost portion was divided by the GFP fluorescence intensity at the innermost portion. To quantify the rate of intracellular accumulation of GFP-NIP5;1 variants in epidermal cells in the transition zone (six to eight cells after onset of elongation), we used the polygon tool of ImageJ to measure the mean intensities of the transverse (apical and basal) PM and cytoplasmic region. Then, to define the rate of intracellular accumulation, the intensity of the cytoplasmic region was divided by the intensity of the sum of the transverse PM and cytoplasmic regions (CITATION). FRAP experiments were performed using FRAP Wizard TCS-SP8 (Leica), equipped with an argon laser and an HC PL APO CS ×40 water immersion lens. For imaging before and after photobleaching, a 488-nm diode laser was used at low levels (<2% transmission) to minimize photobleaching during measurements. A circular region of interest (ROI) 6 µm in diameter was bleached with a 488-nm argon laser at 100% transmission for 3 s. The “Zoom In” option was used in FRAP Wizard. Recovery of fluorescence was recorded at 5-min intervals for up to 30 min. The percentage of recovery was calculated based on the equation: (It − Ip) / (I0 − Ip) × 100, where It is the GFP intensity at each time point, Ip is the GFP intensity after bleaching, and I0 is the GFP intensity before bleaching (CITATION). Roots of 2-week-old plants (1.5 to 4.5 g) were harvested and homogenized using a Multi-Beads Shocker (Yasui Kikai) in buffer (2 mL per 1 g sample, 250 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 100 mM NaCl, 5 mM DTT, 0.5 mM Na2MoO4, 1.5 mM NaF, 0.5 mM Na3VO4, and 2% Nonidet P-40) supplemented with protease inhibitors (cOmplete Mini, EDTA-free [Roche] and 0.5 mg L−1 Pefabloc SC [Roche]) and PhosSTOP phosphatase inhibitor cocktail (Roche) on ice. The lysate was centrifuged (9100g, and then 20,000g, 15 min each at 4°C) to remove cellular debris. Immunoprecipitations (IPs) were performed using the µMACS GFP-tagged protein isolation kit (Miltenyi Biotec) following the supplier’s protocol with the following modification. After rinsing the columns once with 100 μL of wash buffer 2 (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5), the IP samples with 30 μL of microbeads were collected in ∼50 μL of NE buffer (50 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 100 mM NaCl, 2 mM DTT, and 0.01% Brij 35). The anti-phospho-Thr antibody of NIP5;1 was generated by SCRUM as follows. A phosphorylated peptide [Cys-MAPP(pT)PG(pT)PG(pT)PG] (>80% purity) was synthesized and used to immunize rabbits. At 6 weeks after immunization, 20 mL of serum was collected and affinity purified using the phosphorylated peptide. To remove antibodies recognizing nonphosphorylated sequences, the eluate was absorbed with a nonphosphorylated peptide (Cys-MAPPTPGTPGTPG) on an affinity column. The flow-through fraction contained the anti-phospho-Thr NIP5;1 antibodies. For phosphatase treatment, 0.5 μL of lambda protein phosphatase (New England Biolabs) and 1 μL of 10 mM MnCl2 were added to tubes containing 8.5 μL of IP sample including microbeads and were then incubated at 30°C for 1 h. Control samples were supplemented with an equivalent volume of NE buffer and MnCl2. Then, 4 μL of 4× LDS sample buffer (Thermo Fischer Scientific) and DTT (166 mM final concentration) were added and the samples were denatured at 85°C for 10 min. For immunoblotting, samples were separated on a NuPAGE Novex 4 to 12% Bis-Tris gel (Thermo Fischer Scientific) and transferred to a PVDF membrane (Merck Millipore) by a standard wet-transfer method. The membrane was immediately blocked with 3% (w/v) skim milk (Difco) in TBST (50 mM Tris, 150 mM NaCl, and 0.1% Tween 20) for 1 h at room temperature. The membrane was then incubated with anti-GFP monoclonal antibody (1:2000; mouse IgG1-κ; Nacalai Tesque) or the anti-phosphoTNIP5;1 polyclonal antibody (1:500) diluted with 3% (w/v) skim milk in TBST for 1 to 2 h. The secondary antibody was either horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated anti-mouse IgG antibody (1:10,000; GE Healthcare; cat. no. NV931) or HRP-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG antibody (1:10,000; GE Healthcare; cat. no. NV934). After washing the membrane with TBST, 2 mL of Luminata Forte Western HRP substrate (Merck Millipore) was applied and luminescence was imaged with a LuminoGraph I system (ATTO). Capped cRNA was transcribed in vitro from XbaI-linearized vectors using the mMESSAGE mMACHINE kit (Ambion). Oocytes injected with the cRNA of interest using an injector (Drummond Nanoject II Auto-Nanoliter) were kept in MBS buffer [88.0 mM NaCl, 1.0 mM KCl, 2.4 mM NaHCO3, 15.0 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 0.3 mM Ca(NO3)2, 0.41 mM CaCl2, 0.82 mM MgSO4, 10 µg mL−1 sodium penicillin, and 10 µg mL−1 streptomycin sulfate] for 48 h at 18°C. Then, oocytes with GFP signals were selected under a fluorescence microscope (MVX10; Olympus) and incubated in medium supplemented with 5 mM boric acid for 30 min. Five oocytes were pooled in DigiTUBEs (GL Sciences) and washed with 1 mL of boron-free MBS buffer five times. Oocytes were incubated in 500 μL of concentrated HNO3 for 20 min, followed by incubation for 20 min in a 100°C prewarmed DigiPREP MS apparatus (GL Sciences). The tubes were further incubated at 110°C and 120°C for 20 min each for digestion. Finally, 99.0 μL of concentrated HNO3 was added to dissolve the samples and 2900 μL of Milli-Q water was added. Boron contents in oocytes were determined by ICP-MS as described below. Two-week-old plants grown on solid medium containing 100 µM 11B-enriched (>99%) boric acid were shifted to hydroponic media with 100 µM 11B-enriched boric acid for 1 week. For each line, 12 plants were grown in one pot; half of the plants were sampled at time 0 and the others were supplemented with 1 µM 10B-enriched (>99%) boric acid for 24 h. The root and shoot tissues were dried at 60°C for 3 d and the dry weights were measured. The samples were digested for 24 h in DigiTUBEs (GL Sciences) with 6 mL of concentrated nitric acid (for boron determination; Wako Pure Chemical) at 110°C in a DigiPREP MS apparatus (GL Sciences). After the nitric acid solution was evaporated, 10 mL of 2% HNO3 was added to dissolve the samples. The solution was filtered with a DigiFILTER (0.45 μm; GL Sciences) to remove solid materials and used for ICP-MS. Boron concentrations were determined using an ICP-MS ELAN DRC-e equipped with ESI Autosamplers (Perkin-Elmer). 10B was measured for the tracer experiment and 11B was measured for the boron concentration in oocytes. Purified water was produced using the Milli-Q Advantage A10 purification system (Millipore). Data were subjected to analysis of variance using the SPSS software (IBM). Statistical significance was assessed by least significant differences and Duncan’s multiple range tests.
