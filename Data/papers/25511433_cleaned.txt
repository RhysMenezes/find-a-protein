!~ABS~! Photosystem II (PSII) is a multiprotein complex that catalyzes the light-driven water-splitting reactions of oxygenic photosynthesis. Light absorption by PSII leads to the production of excited states and reactive oxygen species that can cause damage to this complex. Here, we describe Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) At1g71500, which encodes a previously uncharacterized protein that is a PSII auxiliary core protein and hence is named PHOTOSYSTEM II PROTEIN33 (PSB33). We present evidence that PSB33 functions in the maintenance of PSII-light-harvesting complex II (LHCII) supercomplex organization. PSB33 encodes a protein with a chloroplast transit peptide and one transmembrane segment. In silico analysis of PSB33 revealed a light-harvesting complex-binding motif within the transmembrane segment and a large surface-exposed head domain. Biochemical analysis of PSII complexes further indicates that PSB33 is an integral membrane protein located in the vicinity of LHCII and the PSII CP43 reaction center protein. Phenotypic characterization of mutants lacking PSB33 revealed reduced amounts of PSII-LHCII supercomplexes, very low state transition, and a lower capacity for nonphotochemical quenching, leading to increased photosensitivity in the mutant plants under light stress. Taken together, these results suggest a role for PSB33 in regulating and optimizing photosynthesis in response to changing light levels.
!~RES~! A mutant of At1g71500 was identified as part of the Chloroplast 2010 functional genomics pipeline (CITATION, CITATION, CITATION; CITATION). Over 5,200 Arabidopsis homozygous T-DNA lines were screened for altered Chl fluorescence in plants grown under a photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD) of either 100 or 1,000 μmol photons m−2 s−1. The Chloroplast 2010 Project identified the SALK_098173 mutant (now called psb33-1) as having a very low maximal PSII quantum yield (Fv/Fm) following 3 h of photoinhibiting light (1,000 PPFD). Examination of the expression of PSB33 from transcriptome sequencing studies in Arabidopsis (CITATION) revealed that PSB33 had a similar transcript abundance to other auxiliary PSII subunits (Supplemental Table S1). These results led to the hypothesis that the mutant was impacted in PSII function. Several lines of evidence confirm that the phenotype is due to a mutation of At1g71500. First, photosynthetic defects were found for homozygous mutants with two additional alleles, psb33-2 (Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory [GABL]_GT25677) and psb33-3 (German Plant Genomics Research Program [GABI]_574D02; Fig. 1, A and B). Second, introduction of the native PSB33 gene into psb33-1 by Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated transformation (psb33-1-C; Fig. 1D; Supplemental Fig. S1A) restored PSB33 abundance and reversed the psb33 mutant growth and PSII supercomplex accumulation phenotypes (Supplemental Fig. S1, B and C). To test the hypothesis that the subcellular localization of the protein is consistent with a function in the light reactions of photosynthesis, anti-PSB33 antibodies were generated as described in “Materials and Methods.” These antibodies recognized a protein from leaf extracts of wild-type plants that migrates under SDS and urea denaturing PAGE consistent with a molecular mass of 23 kD. The protein was not detected in extracts from psb33-2 and psb33-3, demonstrating antibody specificity (Fig. 1C). The complemented line accumulates the protein to levels comparable to wild-type plants (Supplemental Fig. S1A). Also, the partial loss-of-function psb33-1 allele, which has a T-DNA insertion in the 5′ untranslated region (UTR), showed an 85% reduction compared with the wild-type amount of PSB33 (Fig. 1C). The severity of the slow-growth phenotype of the mutants correlated well with the degree of protein reduction, with the growth of the psb33-1 mutant intermediate to that of the wild type and the two protein-coding sequence insertion mutants (Fig. 1D). [[FIGURE]] The total Chl contents and Chl a/b ratios of the mutant plants are slightly lower than those of wild-type plants (Table I), suggesting minor changes in the abundance of the Chl-containing complexes in the mutant plants in vivo. However, levels of LHC, PSII, PSI, cytochrome b6f complex, and ATPase synthase proteins detected by immunodetection, heme-specific staining, and two-dimensional (2D) blue native/SDS-PAGE coupled with mass spectrometry showed no significant differences between psb33-1 mutant and wild-type plants under nonstressful standard growth light conditions (Fig. 2; Supplemental Fig. S2). Chl content, Chl a/b ratio (CITATION), and oxygen evolution were obtained from fresh leaves. Minimal fluorescence yield (F0), Fv/Fm, functional reaction centers per cross-sectional leaf area (RC/ABS), and photosynthetic performance index (PI) were calculated from fast fluorescence induction. Electron transfer rate of PSII (ETRII), quantum yield of PSII (YII), and NPQ were obtained at steady-state light induction. Quenching related to state transitions was calculated from fluorescence measurements. Proton-motive force (PMF), ΔpH, and ΔΨ were obtained by measuring the electrochromic band shift. n = 3 to 18. Asterisk denotes a significant difference at P < 0.05, and ns indicates no significant difference from the wild type at P ≤ 0.05. –, No data collected or data absence. [[FIGURE]] A search for homologs of Arabidopsis PSB33 among the plant and algal genomes available in the National Center for Biotechnology Information database revealed one or two homologs of PSB33 (Supplemental Fig. S3, A and C). PSB33 and orthologs share similarity with Rieske-type proteins, and the highest scoring structural homolog to PSB33 in the Protein Data Bank is the Rieske-type nonheme iron monooxygenase from Pseudomonas putida (CITATION). However, neither the iron-sulfur-binding residues nor the mononuclear iron-binding site is present in PSB33 (Supplemental Fig. S3A). PSB33 and orthologs in land plants and algae contain a putative transmembrane region near the C terminus. In land plants, this region includes a partial Chl-binding domain (pfam00504; CITATION). The highest scoring BLAST hits of this domain are orthologs of Arabidopsis PSBS (Supplemental Fig. S3B), a protein in the LHC superfamily that is involved in NPQ in land plants. No orthologs of PSB33 were found in cyanobacteria. Instead, the cyanobacterial genomes analyzed contain a closely related protein that has retained the iron-sulfur-binding residues and lacks the C-terminal extension that is characteristic of PSB33. The algal genomes analyzed encode both an ortholog of PSB33 and an ortholog of this cyanobacterial protein (Supplemental Fig. S3, A and C). To test the hypothesis that PSB33 is a membrane-bound chloroplast protein situated close to PSII, a PSB33-GFP fusion protein was transiently expressed in tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) leaves (GFP at the C terminus). GFP fluorescence and Chl autofluorescence were colocalized (Fig. 3A), indicating that the fusion protein is targeted to the chloroplast. Biochemical fractionation methods were employed to confirm this finding and to further localize the native PSB33 within a subcompartment of the chloroplast. Intact Arabidopsis chloroplasts were isolated by Percoll gradient centrifugation, lysed, and further fractionated by Suc density gradient centrifugation followed by immunodetection using a PSB33-specific antibody. Consistent with the hypothesis that PSB33 is a membrane-associated PSII protein, a signal was detected in membrane-containing and PSII-containing fractions (whole leaf, chloroplast, thylakoid, PSII-enriched membranes, and PSII-LHCII supercomplexes) but not in the soluble chloroplast stroma or thylakoid lumen fractions (Fig. 3B). [[FIGURE]] The hypothesis that PSB33 is a PSII-associated protein was evaluated by comparing its enrichment in spinach (Spinacia oleracea) leaf PSII-LHCII and PSII core complexes relative to that of the PSII core protein CP43 (CITATION; Fig. 3C); a similar 1.5-fold enrichment was obtained for the two proteins, suggesting a similar stoichiometry in the PSII protein complex. To identify the specific PSII subcomplexes containing PSB33, thylakoid membranes were separated by blue native PAGE followed by immunodetection using antibodies directed against PSII protein D1 (D1), PSI P700 Chl a apoprotein A1 (PsaA), or PSB33 (Fig. 3D). Strikingly, on blue native gels, the ratio of the D1-containing complexes was different in wild-type versus mutant plants, and again, the difference was more dramatic in the plant with the null allele compared with the psb33-1 plant that retains 15% of the PBS33 (Fig. 3D; Table II). The defect appeared to be specific to PSII, because both the abundance of tested polypeptides in the other complexes and the level of the PSI supercomplex were unaltered in the mutant as monitored on the basis of PsaA accumulation (Fig. 3D). PSB33 was found in most D1-containing PSII subcomplexes (Fig. 3D). Further evidence that PSB33 is a PSII component was obtained by cross-linking PSB33 against surface-exposed thylakoid membrane proteins and by coimmunoprecipitation using anti-PSB33 antibodies (Supplemental Fig. S4). PSB33 was cross-linked to a high-Mr protein complex that included the PSII proteins LHCII, CP43, D2, and D1 (Supplemental Fig. S4A). Coimmunoprecipitation also showed an interaction with CP43 and Lhcb1.3. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that PSB33 is present in the peripheral region of PSII close to CP43 and LHCII. The total protein contents of D1 and PSB33 in thylakoid membranes are indicated as percentages. The distributions of D1 and PSB33 in PSII protein complexes are estimated by quantitative immunodetection of blue native gels. The results shown are averages of three to five replicates with sd indicated. n.d., Not detected. To verify the orientation of PSB33 within the thylakoid membrane, we used a gene fusion, which encodes alkaline phosphatase (PhoA) followed by the alpha peptide of β-galactosidase (LacZα) as a topological reporter in Escherichia coli (CITATION). This approach relies on the bioenergetic analogy both between the bacterial periplasm positive (p) side and the thylakoid lumen, in which protons accumulate during active electron transport, and between the bacterial cytoplasm negative (n) side and the plastid stroma, which becomes proton deficient. High PhoA activity indicates a p-side location of the reporter, while LacZ activity indicates an n-side location of the reporter (CITATION; CITATION). As shown in Supplemental Figure S3D, when the PhoA-LacZα reporter is fused to the N-terminal side of the transmembrane region, transformants display predominantly β-galactosidase activity, suggesting that the Rieske-like domain faces the stroma. Because of the purple coloration of the two C-terminal constructs, we cannot distinguish between a periplasmic localization or insertion of the fusion in a transmembrane region; the latter is supported by I-TASSER (CITATION) structure prediction (Supplemental Fig. S3, D and E). We attribute the slow-growth phenotype of psb33 mutant plants to the impairment of photosynthesis, which is consistent with the physical association of the protein with components of PSII and LHCII and the change in distribution of Chl-containing complexes in the corresponding psb33 mutant. To further pursue this, we measured photosynthetic electron transfer function under various light conditions. First, the activity of the PSII complex was assessed by measuring oxygen-evolving activity and Chl fluorescence in vivo. Notably, oxygen-evolving activity decreased in the psb33 mutants even at relatively low light levels (50 PPFD) and was further decreased at higher light intensity (Fig. 4A). This decrease of activity in the mutants could be explained by the observed instability of the PSII-LHCII supercomplexes. Furthermore, consistent with the lower oxygen-evolving activity, the psb33 mutant plants displayed a lower Fv/Fm ratio compared with wild-type plants (Fig. 4B) both under growth (120) and high (800) PPFD. In line with these results, only a slightly lower Fv/Fm ratio of 0.78 was obtained in dark-acclimated mutant plants compared with 0.83 in the wild-type plants (Table I; Fig. 4B). Additional Chl fluorescence studies monitoring PSII in dark-adapted plants transferred to various light conditions showed that the photochemistry parameter for photochemical quenching was higher in psb33 mutants than in wild-type plants. This parameter gives an indication that a larger proportion of psb33 mutant PSII reaction centers stayed open compared with in wild-type plants (Table I). Additionally, psb33 mutants had an overall higher electron transfer rate (quantum yield of PSII and electron transfer rate of PSII) compared with wild-type plants (Table I). Interestingly, Chl fluorescence studies from light-exposed plants that were subsequently dark adapted showed a lowered electron transfer rate for the PSB33 null mutant compared with wild-type plants (Supplemental Fig. S5D), which correlates well with the slow-growth phenotype. In line with the above results, the abundance of both D1 and CP43 decreased to 80% of the initial value in psb33-3 (null allele) mutants exposed to 120 PPFD and further decreased to 50% to 60% of dark-acclimated levels following irradiation at 800 PPFD (Fig. 4C). In contrast, wild-type plants maintained dark-acclimated D1 and CP43 levels following a shift from dark to 120 PPFD (growth light). A decrease in wild-type reaction center proteins (to 80% of dark-acclimated levels) was observed only following a shift to 800 PPFD (Fig. 4C). [[FIGURE]] The above results and the observed whole-plant phenotype show that mutant plants lacking PSB33 are sensitive to light stress conditions. To investigate the relative extent of light-induced oxidative damage to PSII proteins in the psb33-3 mutant compared with the wild type, we measured ROS accumulation and D1 abundance in light-exposed leaves. Light treatments of 800 PPFD resulted in increased hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), superoxide, and singlet oxygen levels in the mutant leaves (Supplemental Fig. S5, A–C) as well as reduced steady-state D1 protein accumulation (Supplemental Fig. S5E). To address whether the increased ROS levels contributed to the loss of D1, we investigated whether artificially increasing ascorbate levels caused an improvement in the photosynthetic performance index and the D1 abundance in the psb33-3 mutant (CITATION). A positive effect on the performance index and D1 abundance was observed under low-light conditions in the presence of ascorbate, consistent with the hypothesis that ROS damage contributes to the mutant photosynthetic phenotype (Supplemental Fig. S5, E and F). To ask whether reduced D1 abundance in the psb33-3 mutant results from altered D1 degradation or synthesis, we tested the effect of the chloroplast protein synthesis inhibitor lincomycin on the photosynthetic activity. At low light, both in the presence or absence of lincomycin, the psb33-3 mutant showed decreases in D1 levels and photosynthetic performance index (Supplemental Fig. S5, E and F) as compared with the wild type. As expected (CITATION), these effects suggest not only that PSII damage is elevated but also that PSII repair is impaired. Taken together with the observation that psb33-3 plants have greater D1 degradation and lower photosynthetic activity in low light in the absence of lincomycin, these results suggest that the main effect is on the efficiency of the repair cycle. Further evidence that the repair cycle is affected is shown by a positive effect on psb33-3 when incubated with the reactive oxygen scavenger ascorbic acid (CITATION). The growth phenotype of psb33 mutant plants at low and high light correlates well with the results above (Supplemental Fig. S5G). The observations that psb33 mutant plants retain a reduced amount of PSII-LHCII supercomplexes, have altered electron transfer within PSII, and are sensitive to photoinhibition suggest a role for PSB33 in preventing PSII damage and/or enhancing the stability of this complex. This led us to hypothesize that NPQ, as a key regulatory component, could be affected in the psb33 mutants. NPQ kinetics were measured at three different light intensities (300, 700, and 1,300 PPFD), and the plants carrying severe psb33 alleles displayed an initial increase (60–180 s) and a subsequent decrease (180–600 s) in NPQ compared with the wild type at 300 and 700 PPFD. To our great surprise, NPQ of psb33 mutant plants resembled that of wild-type plants at 1,300 PPFD (Fig. 5A). The effect on NPQ observed with the mutant could be related to the observed loss of the PSII-LHCII supercomplex in the psb33 mutants, but we were interested to determine whether the PSB33 mutant also displayed other phenotypes indicative of impaired NPQ, such as an altered luminal pH, increased activity of the violaxanthin cycle, and state transitions (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION). [[FIGURE]] To investigate these parameters, we first analyzed the proton gradient (ΔpH) and transmembrane potential (ΔΨ) in the lumen by measuring the electrochromic band shift at 515 nm. No significant difference in proton-motive force, ΔpH, or ΔΨ was observed between the psb33-3 mutant and the wild type (Table I). To further test whether the violaxanthin cycle was altered, we measured the deepoxidation state of violaxanthin by extracting pigments from leaves exposed to 120, 300, and 1,300 PPFD. In fact, the deepoxidation state was 10 times lower in the psb33-3 mutant than in the wild type when exposed to 700 PPFD (Fig. 5B). That psb33 mutants show a relatively moderate change in NPQ activity can be put in comparison with npq1, an Arabidopsis zeaxanthin null mutant, that still retains 25% of the NPQ relative to the wild type (CITATION). Furthermore, reflecting the almost normal NPQ at 1,300 PPFD, the deepoxidation state of the psb33-3 mutant at this light intensity was similar to that of wild-type plants (Fig. 5B). Yet another component of NPQ is how plants regulate photosynthesis by state transition (i.e. redistribution of LHCII between the two photosystems; CITATION; CITATION; CITATION; CITATION). The state transition processes are influenced by the phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of various PSII proteins and the trimeric LHC (CITATION; CITATION). The thylakoid Ser/Thr-protein kinases STN7 and STN8, which phosphorylate LHCII and PSII, respectively, were shown previously to be activated by a reduced plastoquinone pool (CITATION). We measured the phosphorylation status of the thylakoid membrane proteins LHCII, D1, D2, and CP43 in plants acclimated to dark, 120 PPFD, and 800 PPFD (Supplemental Fig. S6). Phosphorylation of LHCII was only slightly altered in psb33 mutants. This indicates that reduction of the plastoquinone pool is not limited by a loss of PSB33 and suggests that the LHC state transition is functional in psb33-3. On the other hand, the phosphorylation level of PSII was reduced in psb33-1 and psb33-3 mutants relative to the wild type, and we propose that the lack of the PSII-LHCII supercomplex is the limiting factor for PSII phosphorylation in the mutant. In contrast to these findings, the measured state transition was greatly altered in the mutants. The state transition from state 1 to state 2 and from state 2 to state 1 was very low in the leaky psb33-1 mutant (with 15% residual PSB33; Fig. 1C) and completely absent in the null psb33-3 mutant (Fig. 5C).
!~MM~! Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) Col and Landsberg erecta wild-type and mutant plants were obtained from the Arabidopsis Biological Resource Center (www.Arabidopsis.org). Plants were grown in an 8-h-light (150 PPFD)/16-h-dark cycle in either a Conviron or Percival (controlled environments limited) growth chamber (model MTR26 or E30BHOC8). The plants were screened by PCR for homozygosity of the T-DNA insertion using primers 097813_F and 097813_R for SALK_097813, GT25677_F and GT25677_R for GT25677, 574D02_F and 574D02_R for 574D02, and T-DNA left border primers LBb1, Ds3-4, and o8409 for SALK, CSHL, and GABI-Kölner Arabidopsis T-DNA lines, respectively. DNA fragments were amplified by 30 cycles of denaturation at 94°C for 30 s, annealing at 63°C for 45 s, and extension at 72°C for 3 min. Plant homologs of PSB33 were identified by a BLAST search at the National Center for Biotechnology Information (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov). Intracellular location and membrane topology were predicted via a suite of prediction programs (ARAMEMNON; CITATION). Amino acid sequences were aligned in Jalview using ClustalW and Gblock sorting before constructing a phylogenetic tree (iTOL). A structural homology model of Arabidopsis PSB33 was built from its amino acid sequence using I-TASSER (CITATION) with Protein Data Bank code h319. Protein sequence alignments between PSB33 (At1g71500) and closely related homologs from land plants, green algae, and cyanobacteria were created with MUSCLE (CITATION) and visualized with ESPript (CITATION). Transmembrane regions were predicted with a strict cutoff in DAS (CITATION). The neighbor-joining tree of PSB33 orthologs encoded in the genomes of land plants and green algae was constructed with MEGA. Translational fusions between PSB33 and the dual PhoA-LacZα reporter (CITATION) were engineered at the 5′ and 3′ sides of the putative transmembrane region. The gene encoding the PhoA-LacZα reporter was amplified from pMA650 (CITATION) using PhoA_BamHI_F and LacZ_AgeI_R. The 5′ region of PSB33 was amplified using Psb33_NcoI and either Psb33_BamHI_1 for construct 1, Psb33_BamHI_2 for construct 2, or Psb33_BamHI_3 for construct 3. The 3′ region of PSB33 was amplified using Psb33_XbaI and either Psb33_AgeI_1 for construct 1, Psb33_AgeI_2 for construct 2, or Psb33_AgeI_3 for construct 3. For constructs 1 to 3, a four-way ligation was performed between pBAD22 (digested NcoI/XbaI), the 5′ fragment of PSB33 (digested NcoI/BamHI), the PhoA-LacZα reporter (digested BamHI/AgeI), and the 3′ fragment of PSB33 (digested AgeI/XbaI). For the C-terminal fusion (construct 4), a three-way ligation was performed between pBAD22 (digested NcoI/XbaI), PSB33 amplified with primers PSB33_NcoI and PSB33_BamHI_4 (digested NcoI/BamHI), and the PhoA-LacZα reporter amplified with primers PhoA_BamHI_F and LacZ_XbaI_stop_R (digested BamHI/XbaI). The sequence-verified constructs were transformed into Escherichia coli NEB alpha cells (New England Biolabs) and plated on dual indicator plates as described (CITATION) except that 0.2% (w/v) Ara was used for induction instead of isopropylthio-β-galactoside. For transgenic complementation analysis, a 2-kb DNA fragment, including a 0.7-kb region upstream of the ATG site, the full genomic PSB33 sequence, and a 0.2-kb 3′ UTR, was amplified by using primers PSB33_F and PSB33_R and cloned into the vector pEGAD (The Arabidopsis Information Resource). The resulting pEGAD-PSB33 clone was introduced by electroporation into Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain AGL0. Transformation of the homozygous psb33-1 mutant was carried out using the floral dip method (CITATION). Transformants were selected on soil with the herbicide BASTA (120 mg L−1; Bayer Scientific; Chemical Abstracts Service no. 77182-82-2). The T1 and T2 generations of transformants were assayed by phenotypic analysis, blue native gel electrophoresis, and immunodetection. A complementary DNA clone (U17348) for At1g71500 was obtained from the Arabidopsis Biological Resource Center, and the open reading frame minus its stop codon was amplified using primers U17348_F and U17348_R. The obtained product was reamplified using primers U17348_RE_F and U17348_RE_R, cloned in the Gateway entry vector PDONR221, and fused in frame to the 5′ end of a GFP in the PMDC83 destination vector (CITATION; Life Technologies). The destination vector was transformed into A. tumefaciens strain LBA4404 and infected into tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum). PSB33-GFP expression in infected tobacco leaves was imaged after 48 h using a confocal laser scanning microscope (Olympus Fluoview FV1000). Fluorescence from GFP was detected by excitation at 488 nm and a 510-nm emission filter. Chl autofluorescence was detected using an excitation wavelength of 543 nm and a 633-nm long-pass emission filter. Plant tissue, chloroplasts, stroma, thylakoid membranes, PSII-enriched membranes, PSII-LHCII, PSII cores, and lumen were isolated from Arabidopsis or spinach (Spinacia oleracea) as described (CITATION). Intact chloroplasts were isolated by Percoll gradient centrifugation, and thylakoid membranes were isolated and fractionated by Suc gradient centrifugation. Proteins were separated according to CITATION. Denaturing PAGE and immunodetection were performed as described (CITATION; CITATION). An antibody specific for PSB33 (α1-PSB33) was produced by immunization of rabbits with a peptide (corresponding to amino acids 274–287 of PSB33) and purified by affinity chromatography (Innovagen). A second antibody (α2-PSB33) specific for PSB33 was produced by immunization of rabbits with a recombinant protein corresponding to amino acids 61 to 242 of PSB33 (Agrisera TEF5 AS121852). Antibodies for subunit IV of the cytochrome b6f complex were raised against its C-terminal region, and those for the Rieske subunit cytochrome b6f complex iron-sulfur subunit (PetC) were raised against the entire mature protein of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. Antibodies against CP43 (AS06 110), α1-D1 (AS10704), α2-D1 (AS11 1786), Lhca1 (AS01 005), Lhca2 (AS01 006), Lhcb1 (AS01 004), Lhcb2 (AS01 003), Lhcb4 (AS04 045), the large subunit of Rubisco (AS03 037-10), PsaA (AS06 172), cytochrome f (AS06 119), PetC (AS08 330), actin (ABIN619544), and PsaN (AS06 109) were obtained from Agrisera. Immunoreactive proteins were visualized using the SuperSignal WestPico Horseradish Peroxidase detection kit (Thermo Scientific) as directed by the manufacturer. For immunoprecipitation, chloroplasts from 3-week-old wild-type Col and psb33-1 mutant plants were isolated and gradient purified as described. The chloroplasts were resuspended in solubilization buffer (20 mm Tricine-NaOH, pH 7.8, 5 mm MgCl2, and 100 mm Suc) containing 10 mm n-dodecyl β-d-maltoside and incubated at room temperature for 15 min. The insoluble membrane particles were removed by centrifugation at 4°C at 14,000g for 30 min, and the protein concentration was measured on the resulting supernatant by using the Lowry protein assay as described (CITATION). Pierce cross-link magnetic beads were coupled to α1-PSB33 according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Pierce Crosslink Magnetic IP/Co-IP Kit 88805). The beads were incubated with 50 µL of solubilized chloroplasts at a protein concentration of 2 μg μL−1 for 30 min with slow rotation at room temperature. Washing and elution of proteins coimmunoprecipitated with PSB33 were performed according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Pierce Crosslink Magnetic Co-IP Kit 88805). The eluted proteins were separated on a 15% (v/v) polyacrylamide gel and stained with silver as described (CITATION). In-gel digestion of selected protein bands was performed as described (CITATION). TMBZ staining was done on 12% (w/v) SDS gels (run as described above). The samples were solubilized for 30 min on ice with 50 mm dithiothreitol in sample buffer (note, not 2-mercaptoethanol). TMBZ was dissolved in methanol in the dark at room temperature, and after dissolving, NaOAc (CH3COONa; 1 m, pH 5) was added to the TMBZ solution at final concentrations of 0.25 m and 6.3 mm TMBZ. The gels were incubated for 45 min in the dark at 4°C. To reveal the heme bands, H2O2 was added at a final concentration of 30 mm. After approximately 10 min to stop the development, the H2O2 solution was exchanged to water. Thylakoid membranes were resuspended in 20% (w/v) glycerol and 25 mm BisTris-HCl, pH 7, to a Chl concentration of 2 mg mL−1. An equal volume of 1.5% (w/v) n-dodecyl β-d-maltoside in resuspension buffer was added, and the mixture was incubated on ice for 10 min. After centrifugation at 14,000g for 30 min, the supernatant was supplemented with 0.1 volume of sample buffer (100 mm BisTris-HCl, pH 7, 0.5 m ε-amino-n-caproic acid, 30% [w/v] Suc, and 50 mg mL−1 Serva Blue G) and subjected to blue native gel electrophoresis with a gradient of 5% to 13.5% (v/v) polyacrylamide gel on the separation gel (CITATION). For separation of proteins in the second dimension, individual lanes were excised from the first-dimension gel and incubated with 5% (v/v) β-mercaptoethanol in SDS sample buffer for 30 min at room temperature prior to SDS-PAGE on 15% (v/v) polycrylamide gels. For immunodetection, the native gels were incubated in blotting buffer (25 mm Tris, 192 mm Gly, and 10% [v/v] methanol) for 30 min before the transfer of proteins to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane for 120 min at 30 mA gel−1 (Immobilon; Millipore). After transfer, the membranes were blocked with 10% (w/v) skim milk. An incubation with the first antibody was done overnight at 4°C. The membranes were washed six times using Tween Tris-buffered saline and then incubated at room temperature with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody for 1 h. The membranes were washed six times with Tween Tris-buffered saline and the immunoreactive proteins were visualized following a 10-min incubation with detecting reagents from the SuperSignal WestPico Horseradish Peroxidase detection kit (Thermo Scientific). The bands indicated by arrows in Supplemental Figure S4A were excised from the gel and treated with trypsin (sequencing-grade modified trypsin; Promega) according to CITATION. Peptides were analyzed as described previously (CITATION) using a nanoAcquity UltraPerformance HPLC system (Waters) coupled to a Waters Xevo quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometer. Ultra-performance liquid chromatography was performed using a 5-μm Symmetry C18, 180-μm × 20-mm reverse-phase trap column in line with a 1.7-μm BEH130, 75-μm × 100-mm reverse-phase C18 analytical column. Protein Lynx Global Server (version 2.4; Waters) was used to process the liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry raw data and to determine protein identifications (Supplemental Fig. S4). In vivo steady-state and single-burst oxygen-evolving activity was measured using a gas-phase oxygen electrode system (LD1/2 Electrode chamber; Hansatech) in 11.3-mm2 leaf discs using a Clark-type electrode (S1 Oxygen electrode disc; Hansatech) and a red light-emitting diode light system (LH36/2R; Hansatech) at various light conditions. The Chl content and pigments of whole leaves were either determined by extraction in 80% (v/v) acetone and measured in a spectrophotometer at wavelengths of 646.6 and 663.6 nm according to CITATION or determined by extraction in methanol and subsequently measured by high performance liquid chromatography. Chl fluorescence was measured using a pulse-amplitude fluorometer (dual PAM-100; Walz). Its parameters were analyzed according to standard techniques (CITATION), and curves were obtained using light intensities of 300, 700, and 1,300 PPFD. For the data presented in Table I, plants were dark adapted for a minimum of 12 h, and measurements were taken every 20 s for the first 3 min and then every 1 min for 22 min until a steady state of photosynthesis was reached at 25 min. Otherwise, plants were dark adapted for a minimum of 12 h, and measurements were taken every 20 s for up to 10 min. For the data presented in Supplemental Figure S5, plants were dark adapted for a minimum of 12 h before being exposed to high light (800 PPFD), and measurements were taken after 15 min of dark adaptation from long-term dark-adapted plants and from plants exposed to either 2 or 4 h of light illumination. The electrochromic band shift was measured using a dual PAM-100 setup with a 515/535 module. Plants were dark adapted for a minimum of 30 min, and leaves were illuminated for 3 min with 166, 660, 1,287, or 1,952 PPFD, after which proton-motive force, ΔpH, and ΔΨ values were determined as described (CITATION). State transition was measured using a dual PAM-100 fluorometer according to CITATION. The excitation wavelength of actinic red light had a peak at 628 nm, and that of far-red light had a peak at 716 nm. The light intensity used was 100 PPFD. Histochemical staining for H2O2 and superoxide was detected by incubation with either 3,3′-diaminobenzidine (Sigma-Aldrich) or nitroblue tetrazolium (Sigma-Aldrich) for 2 h and subsequently exposed to dark or 1 or 3 h of high light (800 PPFD) as described previously (CITATION). Visualization of singlet oxygen was obtained by fluorescence microscopy on leaves incubated in 330 nm Singlet Oxygen Sensor Green (Sigma-Aldrich) for 2 h and subsequently exposed to dark or 1 or 3 h of high light (800 PPFD) as described previously (CITATION). Leaves that were dark acclimated for 12 h were then incubated with or without 20 mm ascorbic acid and illuminated first with low light (50 PPFD) for 2 h and then subsequently with high light (800 or 1,000 PPFD) for varying time periods. Photosynthetic parameters were determined from fluorescence data recorded at 0, 2, 3, 4, and 5 h using a PEA fluorometer (Hansatech). D1 levels were measured by immunodetection from total leaf protein extraction. Each time point consists of an extraction from three individual leaves.
