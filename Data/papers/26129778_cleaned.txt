!~ABS~! Epigenetic regulation of gene expression is critical for controlling embryonic properties during the embryo-to-seedling phase transition. Here we report that a HISTONE DEACETYLASE19 (HDA19)-associated regulator, SCARECROW-LIKE15 (SCL15), is essential for repressing the seed maturation programme in vegetative tissues. SCL15 is expressed in and GFP-tagged SCL15 predominantly localizes to, the vascular bundles particularly in the phloem companion cells and neighbouring specialized cells. Mutation of SCL15 leads to a global shift in gene expression in seedlings to a profile resembling late embryogenesis in seeds. In scl15 seedlings, many genes involved in seed maturation are markedly derepressed with concomitant accumulation of seed 12S globulin; this is correlated with elevated levels of histone acetylation at a subset of seed-specific loci. SCL15 physically interacts with HDA19 and direct targets of HDA19–SCL15 association are identified. These studies reveal that SCL15 acts as an HDA19-associated regulator to repress embryonic traits in seedlings.
!~RES~! To identify proteins that interact with HDA19, the full-length Arabidopsis HDA19 fused to the yeast GAL4 DNA-binding domain (GAL4 DB) was used as bait to screen an Arabidopsis seedling cDNA library. A total of 1.6 × 106 yeast transformants were screened yielding nine positive clones. One of these clones encoded SCL15 (At4g36710), which is also designated as AtHAM4 based on its genetic interaction with two Petunia HAIRY MERISTEM (HAM) homologues AtHAM1 and AtHAM2 (ref. [b28]). Comparison of deduced amino-acid sequences showed that SCL15 and the HAM homologues AtHAM1, AtHAM2 and AtHAM3 were fairly divergent, showing only 28–31% identity at the amino-acid level ([S1]). SCL15 shared 86% amino-acid identity with BnSCL1, an auxin responsive HDA19-interacting protein in Brassica napus[b29] and a member of the plant-specific GRAS (GIBBERELLIN ACID INSENSITIVE (GAI), REPRESSOR OF GIBBERELLIC ACID INSENSITIVE3 (RGA) and SCR)[b30] protein family. Phylogenetic analysis of all the Arabidopsis GRAS proteins confirmed their relationships ([S1])[b31]. Most GRAS domain proteins identified so far are nuclear proteins and SCL15 was shown to be mainly nuclear localized[b31]. To confirm the nuclear localization of SCL15, a transient expression assay was conducted in tobacco epidermal cells with a soluble-modified red-shifted green fluorescent protein (smRS-GFP) translational fusion. The SCL15-smRS-GFP was localized only in the nuclei ([S1]), indicating that SCL15 is a nuclear-restricted GRAS protein. To corroborate the physical association between SCL15 and HDA19 detected in the yeast two-hybrid system, three kinds of assays were conducted. First, in vitro GST pull-down affinity assays were performed. [35S]methionine-labelled SCL15 protein was tested for its ability to interact with recombinant GST–HDA19 fusion protein. SCL15 bound to GST-HDA19 fusion protein, but not to GST alone ([f1]). Second, BiFC assays in Arabidopsis protoplasts were carried out. SCL15 was fused to the N-terminal yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) fragment and HDA19 was fused to the C-terminal YFP fragment. A yellow fluorescent signal was observed when SCL15-N-YFP was co-delivered into protoplasts with HDA19-C-YFP ([f1] and [S1]). Third, a co-IP experiment was performed using nuclear protein extracts from roots of T3 homozygous SCL15pro::SCL15-sGFP transgenic plants that were in an scl15-1 background and had been used for the complementation assays. This assay showed that HDA19 co-precipitated with SCL15-sGFP ([f1]). These results provide good evidence that SCL15 physically interacts with HDA19 in the nuclei of Arabidopsis cells. To test whether SCL15–HDA19 interaction affects the histone acetylation status at a target promoter, a SCL15-GAL4DB fusion was used to co-transform a yeast line with pGAL1-HDA19. The yeast strain (GAL4UAS-GAL1pro::lacZ) harbours an integrated lacZ gene under the control of the GAL1 promoter and is regulated by distinct GAL4-responsive Upstream Activating Sequences (UASGAL1; [f1]). Co-transformation of SCL15-GAL4DB with p426GAL1-HDA19 resulted in reduced β-galactosidase activity when compared with SCL15-GAL4BD alone or empty vectors ([f1]). Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays were then conducted to investigate whether co-expression of SCL15 with HDA19 led to changes in the histone acetylation state at the GAL1 promoter. The histone H3K9 acetylation (H3K9ac) levels around the UASGAL1 sites were significantly reduced when both SCL15-GAL4DB and p426GAL1-HDA19 were expressed compared with SCL15-GAL4DB or the vectors alone ([f1]). This suggests that SCL15 recruits HDA19 to the target promoter via a gene-specific DNA-binding domain to decrease the local histone acetylation levels. For the functional analysis of SCL15 in planta, we obtained two independent T-DNA insertion lines for the SCL15 gene, namely SALK_110871 (scl15-1, also referred to as Atham4-1 (ref. [b28]), and GK292A11 (scl15-2). Based on the available description of the two T-DNA insertion lines (http://www.arabidopsis.org and http://www.gabi-kat.de), the T-DNA insertion site was located in the coding region of SCL15 gene, 1,004 and 1,064 bp downstream of the translation start site, respectively ([f2]). Both of the T-DNA insertions were located in the region encoding the PFYRE domain of SCL15 protein. No transcript was detected in the homozygous mutant plants using reverse transcription (RT)–PCR analysis with primers that either spanned the T-DNA insertions or were downstream of the insertion sites. However, RT–PCR products were amplified when using primers located upstream of the T-DNA insertions ([f2]). This result indicates that transcription of the full-length SCL15 in the mutant plants is disrupted by the T-DNA insertion, but that scl15-1 and scl15-2 could be hypomorphic rather than null mutations. There were no significant abnormalities in plant growth in scl15-1 and scl15-2 plants, as previously described[b28][b31], although they exhibited differences in vegetative growth and development from the wild type before the mid-stage of plant development. The mutant seedlings were smaller than those of the wild type and flowering was delayed by 2 to 3 days in long days when compared with the wild type. The mean rosette leaf numbers of the scl15 and wild-type plants were 12.8±0.6 and 13.9±0.8 (±indicates standard deviation, n=10), respectively ([f2]). The scl15 adult plants at the 32-day-old stage were still shorter (24.9±0.7 cm) than the wild type (30.8±0.8 cm; Student's t-test, P<0.01; [f2]), but subsequently caught up and had a life cycle from germination to mature seeds of about the same duration as wild-type plants. To confirm the phenotypes exhibited in scl15 mutant plants, complementation assays were conducted. The SCL15 genomic sequence fused to sGFP (SCL15pro::SCL15-sGFP) was used to transform scl15-1 mutant plants. Five independent transgenic lines displaying a 3:1 segregation ratio in T2 populations were selected and two of the T3 homozygous lines, Compl-6 and Compl-8, were chosen for the complementation assays. The SCL15-sGFP fusion protein was able to complement the scl15-1 mutant phenotypes ([f2]). There was no difference between the phenotypes of complemented lines and wild-type plants in terms of seedling establishment, flowering and plant growth, indicating that SCL15-sGFP fusion protein is functional. ABA, auxin, sugar and GA are important cues that guide seed maturation and the transition to seed germination[b1][b3]. The effect of ABA, sugar and auxin on SCL15 expression was tested. The level of SCL15 transcript increased substantially in response to ABA and sucrose, whereas SCL15 expression was only moderately altered by auxin treatment ([f2]). The specific expression of SCL15 in vascular tissues, particularly in the root phloem system and chalazal seed coat has been suggested from information in in silico databases, the BAR Arabidopsis eFP browser (http://bar.utoronto.ca/efp/cgi-bin/efpWeb.cgi) and Genevestigator (https://www.genevestigator.com/gv/plant.jsp; [S1]). To confirm the expression pattern, we analysed SCL15 promoter β-glucuronidase (GUS) activity and SCL15-GFP protein localization. The SCL15 promoter-GUS construct was generated by fusing the 2.3-kb fragment directly upstream of the SCL15 start codon to the GUS reporter gene and six independent transformants were analysed. In T1 transgenic Arabidopsis plants, strong GUS staining was observed in the vascular tissues of cotyledons, leaves, stamen filaments and primary and lateral roots ([f3]). During seed development, SCL15pro::GUS expression was not detected in the embryo ([f3]), whereas a strong GUS signal was found in the funiculi and chalazal regions of ovules and mature seeds ([f3]), as well as the vasculature of silique walls ([f3]). A more detailed analysis of SCL15pro::GUS expression pattern was performed using a dissecting microscope. GUS activity was exclusively restricted to the vascular bundles in mature root and a stronger signal was detected on the abaxial (phloem system) sides of root and stem vascular bundles, whereas no GUS activity was found in the adaxial xylem vessels ([f3]). In vegetative apices, GUS activity was observed in the newly formed leaf primordia and the vasculatures of older leaf primordia ([f3]). SCL15 localization was examined in vascular tissues of the scl15-1 mutant expressing SCL15pro::SCL15-sGFP that had been used for the complementation assays. The GFP signal occurred in the phloem CCs as well as in the neighbouring tissues. In leaf petiole, the signal was apparent in the CCs and neighbouring bundle sheath (BS) cells ([f4]). At the root tip, SCL15-sGFP fluorescence was predominantly localized in protophloem sieve elements and neighbouring phloem-pole pericycle cells (Pp; [f4]). In mature roots, the signal was restricted to the nuclei of metaphloem CCs and the Pp cells ([f4]). In developing seeds, SCL15pro::SCL15-sGFP was expressed in the CCs of chalazal ends of the ovule funiculi, a tissue that connects the ovule to the ovary wall. Interestingly, a strong GFP signal was also present in the placentochalaza, a region that is in close proximity to the CCs at the base of the funiculus vasculature ([f4]) and is thought to function as a nutrient unloading zone, particularly for the export of amino acids[b32][b33]. Microarray analysis on scl15-1 and wild-type seedlings was performed to obtain global changes in gene expression caused by SCL15 mutation. Global gene expression patterns in wild-type and the scl15-1 mutant seedlings were profoundly different, such that 606 genes were at least twofold upregulated and 363 genes were more than twofold downregulated in the mutant relative to the wild type (Student's t-test (P≤0.05) from three biological replicates with a Benjamini-Hochberg false discovery rate of 0.05; [S1]). To evaluate the upregulated genes, BiNGO analysis was used to assign gene ontology (GO) categories to the 209 genes that showed more than threefold higher expression in the mutant seedlings[b34]. Most of the over-represented GO categories in the classification system biological function related to reproduction with two distinct subcategories: stress response and seed development ([f5] and [S1]). The seed development group of genes related to those that are fundamental for various aspects of seed maturation and seed filling, namely genes encoding seed storage proteins (SSPs) and oleosins. The stress response group of genes were linked with environmental stress responses and hormone signalling, such as dehydration, cold stress and ABA signalling. However, a closer analysis of the corresponding genes revealed that most of them are also involved in embryogenesis and seed maturation. Besides reproduction and response to stimuli, a few additional small categories were also over-represented, including genes involved in lipid localization and vascular protein processing. These results suggest that SCL15 represses a large subset of seed maturation genes during the embryonic phase to seedling transition and during seedling establishment. The DNA microarray results for embryonic genes that were markedly upregulated in scl15 mutant seedlings were validated using real-time RT–PCR. The tested genes are important in regulating initiation of the seed maturation programme (LEC1 and ABI3), seed reserve trafficking and processing (vacuolar processing enzymes (VPEs), tonoplast intrinsic protein (α-TIP) and reticulon family gene (RTNLB13)) and accumulation (CRA1, CRU3 and Oleo2)[b35]. Consistent with the microarray data, all of the genes noted above were upregulated in the mutant seedlings. Several were more than 20-fold upregulated, which included a seed-specific LEA (At4g21020) gene, RTNLB13 and CRA1 ([f6], [S1] and [S1]). Moreover, the expression of these seed maturation genes in scl15-1 seedlings expressing SCL15pro::SCL15-sGFP did not differ from wild-type plants ([f6]). These results demonstrate that the ectopic expression of a subset of embryonic genes in seedlings is attributable to a defect in SCL15 expression and suggest that derepression of seed maturation genes in scl15 seedlings is mediated by upstream regulators in a manner analogous to that occurring in developing wild-type seeds. To further investigate the extent to which the seed maturation prapram was derepressed in the mutant seedlings, we analysed scl15-1 for the presence of seed storage 12S globulins. Immunoblot analysis was conducted using monoclonal anti-CRA1 antibody against proteins extracted from 2-week-old seedlings. As shown in [f6], an unprocessed ∼55-kDa proglobulin (p12S) as well as 12S globulin species accumulated in untreated scl15-1 seedlings and accumulation of these proteins was increased after treatment with ABA. Globulins were not observed in untreated wild-type seedlings; however, accumulation of these proteins was detected after ABA treatment, although at much lower levels when compared with the ABA-treated scl15-1 seedlings ([f6]). These findings indicates that in vegetative tissues ABA contributes to the derepression of genes encoding seed storage proteins. SCL15 was strongly expressed in the vascular tissues of silique walls, funiculi and chalazal regions of ovules and developing seeds ([f3] and [f4]). Therefore, the expression of various seed maturation genes was examined, including ABI3, α–TIP, CRA1 and Oleo2, in developing siliques corresponding to embryo morphogenesis (5 days post-anthesis (DPA)), mature (10 DPA) and post-mature (16 DPA) stages of embryo development[b32]. Seeds were matured and completely dry after 17 DPA. All seed maturation genes tested in siliques of scl15-1 mutant at 5 DPA were significantly upregulated, showing similar expression levels to that in seedlings. Heart to linear stage (5 DPA) of seed development is specialized in cellularization and tissue type differentiation before storage reserve accumulation[b32]. However, transcripts of these genes were downregulated at the mature stage of embryo development and even further repressed at the post-mature stage compared with the wild type ([f6]). HDA19 is capable of forming a multiprotein complex for the repression of gene expression via histone deacetylation[b25] and is involved in the repression of many seed maturation genes in Arabidopsis seedlings by reducing H3K14ac levels[b18]. ChIP assay was performed to determine whether scl15-1 mutation affected histone acetylation at seed-specific loci that were derepressed in mutant seedlings. Increased acetyl H3K9K14 (H3K9K14ac) levels were found at the translational start regions and/or the proximal promoter regions in a subset of seed maturation genes in scl15-1 seedlings ([f7]). These changes in histone acetylation state at the proximal promoter regions for derepressed seed genes in scl15-1 seedlings were restored to the wild-type levels in the presence of SCL15pro::SCL15-sGFP (Compl-6; [f7]). Histone H4 acetylation levels for ABI3, CRA1, CRU3, AtEM6 and RAB18 were also elevated in the scl15-1 mutant ([S1]); however, H3 and H4 acetylation levels for LEC1 in the mutant were similar to those in the wild type ([f7]). These results indicate that the ectopic expression of many embryonic genes in scl15-1 mutant seedlings was due, at least in part, to increased histone acetylation levels. To verify whether HDA19-SCL15 association plays a direct role in the repression of embryonic genes in seedlings, ChIP assays using anti-HDA19 antibodies were performed in wild-type and scl15-1 seedlings. The LEC1 gene was used as a negative control because it was derepressed without detectable changes in H3 and H4 acetylation levels in scl15-1 seedlings. Six embryonic genes encoding SSPs, oleosins and seed reserve trafficking proteins that were markedly derepressed ([f6]) and displayed a dramatic increase in histone acetylation in scl15-1 seedlings ([f7]) were examined. HDA19 was significantly enriched in the promoter regions of four genes, including the 12S globulin gene CRA1, the protein storage vacuole-localized membrane protein gene α-TIP, SSP processing enzyme gene δ-VPE and the ABA-responsive seed maturation gene At3g02480, in wild type relative to the scl15-1 mutant seedlings ([f7]), indicating that these genes are direct targets of HDA19–SCL15 interaction. ABI3 and Oleo2 did not show significant differences of HDA19 enrichment in the examined promoter regions between wild type and the scl15-1 mutant.
!~MM~! Arabidopsis thaliana ecotype Col-0 was used as the wild-type plant. T-DNA insertion lines SALK_110871 (scl15-1) and GK292A11 (scl15-2) (NASC ID: N427947)[b46] were obtained from the ABRC (Ohio State University) and the NASC (University of Nottingham), respectively. Arabidopsis plants were grown in pots of soil in a growth chamber that was set to 22 °C day/16 °C night on a 16/8 h day/night cycle and 60% relative humidity. Arabidopsis siliques were harvested at the heart to linear (5 DPA), mature (10 DPA) and post-mature (16 DPA) stages of embryo development. Seeds were completely dried after 17 DPA. To grow plants on solid medium, surface-sterilized seeds were kept for 2 days at 4 °C in the dark, placed onto 1/2 MS medium containing 0.7% agar and 1% sucrose, and grown at 22 °C under continuous light. Tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) plants were cultivated in pots of soil in a growth chamber at 22 °C under long day conditions (16/8 h day/night). For ABA treatments, 14-day-old Arabidopsis seedlings were transferred from the 1/2 MS agar-sucrose plates to fresh plates containing the same medium with 0 or 50 μM ABA (A1049; Sigma-Aldrich) and harvested after incubation for 2 days. For the treatment with auxin, GA and sugar, 14-day-old seedlings were incubated in liquid half-strength MS medium supplemented with various concentrations of hormones or sucrose for 1 h. Mock (control) treatment consisted of no or 0.1% ethanol, as the IAA (I2886; Sigma-Aldrich) and GA3 (G7645; Sigma-Aldrich) were dissolved in water and 0.1% ethanol, respectively. ChIP analysis was conducted using 3-week-old Arabidopsis seedlings grown on solid medium plates as described above. Roots of 14-day-old seedlings that were grown on solid medium and treated with 0 or 100 μM ABA (Sigma-Aldrich) for 4 h were used for co-IP assays. All tissues were harvested and flash frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C until used for RNA isolation and protein extraction. Individual plants from T-DNA-tagged lines were genotyped by PCR. The SCL15-specific primers scl-f1 and scl-KO-r1 were used for identification of the wild-type allele and T-DNA left border-specific primer LBb1 and the SCL15-specific primer scl-f1 were used to detect the mutant allele ([S1] for all primer sequences). The position and structure of the T-DNA insertion site were analysed by PCR, Southern blotting and sequencing of the PCR products that spanned the insertion site. Individual homozygous plants were used for total RNA isolation, RT–PCR and real-time RT–PCR. For construction of the yeast two-hybrid cDNA library, total RNA was isolated from 2-week-old Arabidopsis seedlings, converted to cDNA and cloned into a GAL4 activation domain (GAL4 AD) vector pPC86. The SuperScript Plasmid System (Life Technologies) was used for cDNA synthesis and cloning. The open reading frame of the Arabidopsis HDA19 (Accession no. AY093153; At4g38130) was generated by PCR using primers HDA19-f1 and HDA19-r2, and cloned into the SalI-NotI sites of pDBLeu in-frame with the GAL4 DB. This construct served as a bait to screen a cDNA library using the ProQuest Two-Hybrid System (Life Technologies) as previously described[b47]. Candidate positive clones were confirmed by yeast retransformation and DNA sequencing analysis. 5′-RLM-RACE (Applied Biosystems/Ambion) was undertaken to determine the transcription start sites of candidate genes based on the manufacturer's instructions. Alignment of amino-acid sequences was performed using the AlignX programme, Vector NTI Advance 11 suite (Invitrogen), with default settings[b48]. A neighbour-joining phylogenetic tree was generated using MEGA 5 (ref. [b49]) with default parameters. The coding region of the Arabidopsis HDA19 was amplified by PCR using HDA19-f2 and HDA19-r3 primers and inserted in-frame with GST into the SalI and NotI sites of vector pGEX-6P-2 (Amersham Pharmacia). Expression, purification and western blotting analysis of the recombinant HDA19 was carried out as described by Gao et al.[b50]. The entire coding region of SCL15 was amplified by PCR using scl-f3 and scl-r3 primers and cloned into the HindIII and XhoI sites of the expression vector pET-28b (Novagen) in-frame with the His-Tag sequence. The full-length SCL15 protein labelled with [35S]methionine was produced using TNT–Quick Coupled Transcription/Translation System (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions. In vitro protein interaction was detected using a GST pull-down assays as previously described[b50]. Briefly, GST or GST-fusion protein was incubated with [35S]Met-labelled translation mixture in a bead-binding buffer (50 mM K-phosphate (pH 7.6), 450 mM KCl, 10 mM MgCl2, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 1% BSA and 1 μl per 50 ml of buffer of 1:12 diluted protease inhibitors set (Roche Diagnostics)). After incubation for 1 h at room temperature, a 50% slurry of glutathione-Sepharose beads containing 10 mg ml−1 of BSA and 4 μg of ethidium bromide was mixed with the interaction mixture followed by gentle rotation for 1 h at 4 °C. After washing six times with bead-binding buffer without BSA or ethidium bromide, but containing the protease inhibitors set, the bound proteins were eluted with 2 × SDS–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) loading buffer and analysed by 12% SDS–PAGE. After electrophoresis, the gels were dried and subjected to fluorography. Full scans of the fluorographic films are provided in [S1]. DNA sequences for the N-terminal 173-amino-acid EYFP (N-YFP) and C-terminal 64-amino-acid (C-YFP) fragments were amplified previously by PCR and cloned into the plant expression vectors pOCA30 and pFGC5941 to generate pOCA-N-YFP and pFGC-C-YFP, respectively[b51]. N-YFP was also cloned into pFGC5941 to generate a second N-YFP fusion/expression vector (pFGC-N-YFP). WRKY38-coding sequence was amplified using primers WRKY38-f1 and WRKY38-r2, digested with SacI/SpeI and ligated into the SacI-XbaI sites of pOCA-N-YFP to generate an in-frame fusion with N-YFP. The HDA19-coding sequence was amplified using primers HDA19-f2 and HDA19-r3, digested with SpeI and BglII and ligated into the XbaI-BamHI sites of pFGC-C-YFP to form an in-frame fusion with C-YFP. For generating the SCL15-N-YFP fusion construct, the ∼600 bp 5′ and ∼900 bp 3′ coding sequences of SCL15 were amplified using two pairs of primers scl-f6/scl-r6 and scl-f7/scl-r7, digested with SacI/BamHI and BamHI/XbaI, respectively, and sequentially cloned into the same sites of pFGC-N-YFP. WRKY38 was sub-cloned in the same way as SCL15 and was used as a positive control for interaction with HDA19 (ref. [b51]). The plasmids were used for BiFC assays as previously described[b52]. Fluorescence and Hoechst 33258 staining were visualized using a Zeiss LSM 710 confocal microscope. In the absence of Hoechst 33258 staining, fluorescence and chlorophyll were excited with YFP excitation and red channel, respectively, on a Zeiss Axio Imager Z1 microscope with ApoTome and AxioCam MRm (Carl Zeiss). The experiments were performed three times with the same results. Nuclei and nuclear proteins were isolated from roots of 2-week-old Col-0 and SCL15pro::SCL15-sGFP (Compl-6) seedlings as previously described[b53]. Briefly, root powder was homogenized in cold Buffer A (0.4 M sucrose, 10 mM HEPES, 2.5 mM dithiothreitol, 2 mM EDTA, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 protease inhibitor cocktail tablet (Roche Diagnostics) per 50 ml buffer, pH 8). After filtration and centrifugation (14,000g) of the extracts, the pellet was resuspended in 1 ml of cold Buffer B (0.25 M sucrose, 10 mM HEPES, 1% Triton X-100, 10 mM MgCl2, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, protease inhibitor cocktail, pH 8) and centrifuged at 10,000g for 10 min at 4 °C. The resultant pellet was resuspended in 300 μl of cold Buffer C (1.7 M sucrose, 10 mM HEPES, 0.15% Triton X-100, 2 mM MgCl2, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, protease inhibitor cocktail, pH 8). The pellet suspension was then carefully overlaid on top of 500 μl of Buffer C and centrifuged at 16,000g for 45 min (4 °C). To release the nuclear proteins from the enriched nuclei, 300 μl of 1 × IP protein extraction buffer (100 mM NaCl, protease inhibitor cocktail, 110 mM KOAc and 0.5% Triton X-100, pH 7.4) was added to the cold nuclei suspension and subsequently sonicated with a sonicator (Qsonica, Model Q55) set at 35% amplitude for five times with 10 s for each sonication. After addition of 2 μl of benzonase (Sigma) to remove nucleic acids, the mixture was centrifuged at 12,000g for 30 min at 4 °C and the proteins remaining in the supernatant were quantified. Co-IP assays were carried out with a kit using Dynabeads (Life Technologies) following the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, total nuclear proteins (300 μg) were pre-cleared with 1 mg of magnetic beads through continual rotation for 1 h at 4 °C. Polyclonal anti-GFP antibody (7.5 μg; Clontech, Catalogue No. 632592) was coupled to 1.5 mg of magnetic beads at a dilution of 1:200 following the manufacturer's instructions and then incubated with the pre-cleared nuclear protein extract by rotating for 30 min at 4 °C. The immobilized proteins on the GFP-coupled beads were washed four times and subsequently eluted for immunoblotting using anti-HDA19 antibodies[b54] at a dilution of 1:2,000 and HRP-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Invitrogen, Catalogue No. 65–6120) as the secondary antibody at 1:30,000 dilution. The Clarity Western ECL Substrate system (Bio-Rad) was used for immunodetection of HDA19. Full scans of the western blots are shown in [S1]. The effector plasmid SCL15-GAL4BD was constructed by ligating the amplified SCL15 product (primers scl-f4 and scl-r4) between the SalI and NotI sites of the vector pDBLeu (Life Technologies) in-frame with the GAL4BD sequence. To make the construct p426GAL1-HAD19, plasmid pDBLeu-HDA19 was digested with SalI and NotI and the HDA19 fragment cloned between the SalI and NotI sites of the vector p426 GAL1 (Life Technologies). MaV203 yeast cells, expressing an integrated lacZ reporter gene driven by the GAL1 promoter (GAL1pro; Life Technologies), were transformed with either the effector SCL15-GAL4BD only, both SCL15-GAL4BD and p426GAL1-HDA19, or empty vectors pDBLeu and p426 GAL1. The β-galactosidase activity was measured using chlorophenol red-β-D-galactopyranoside. Quantitative data (mean±s.d.) were determined from three independent assays. The GAL1pro contains distant GAL4BD sites located in the 365-bp upstream activation sequence UASG designated as UASGAL1 (ref. [b55]). ChIP experiments were performed as previously reported[b47] using anti-acetyl-histone H3K9 antibody (07–352; Millipore). DNA enrichment was analysed by real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) using specific primers. Three replicates of the ChIP assay were carried out on different preparations of nuclei. ChIP experiment was conducted as described previously[b56]. Chromatin extract was prepared from seedlings treated with formaldehyde. After being sheared to an average length of 500 bp by sonication, the chromatin was immunoprecipitated with specific antibodies, including anti-acetyl-histone H3K9K14 (06–599; Millipore), anti-acetyl-histone H4K5K8K12K16 (06–866; Millipore) and anti-HDA19 (ref. [b54]). qPCR was carried out to detect the DNA cross-linked to the immunoprecipitated proteins. Primers used for qPCR analysis in ChIP assays were designed within 350 bp around the transcription initiation sites (promoter region) or to flank the ATG translation start site (ATG region; [S1]). Primer sequences are given in [S1]. ACT7 was used as internal control for normalization[b7]. Each immunoprecipitation was replicated a minimum of three times and each sample was quantified in triplicate. All results were shown as means±s.d. of at least three biological replicates. For subcellular protein localization, the construct 35Spro::smRS-GFP was generated in the binary vector pCAMBIA[b57] by subcloning the cDNA (U70496) that encodes the smRS-GFP[b58]. The SCL15 open reading frame was amplified by PCR and subcloned into the EcoRI-SacII sites of the plasmid 35Spro::smRS-GFP in-frame with the N-terminus of smRS-GFP generating 35Spro::SCL15-smRS-GFP. Plasmid 35Spro::smRS-GFP was used as the negative control for transient expression in Nicotiana tabacum epidermal cells[b59]. For promoter expression studies, 2,353 bp of the SCL15 promoter including 299 bp of 5′ untranslated region was amplified using primer pairs scl-f8 and scl-r8 and cloned into the binary vector pBI121 by replacing the CaMV 35S promoter. The SCL15pro::GUS plasmid was introduced into Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain GV3101 followed by transformation into Arabidopsis plants using the floral dipping method[b60]. For complementation of the scl15 mutant, the SCL15 gene sequence (including 2,051 bp of promoter, the 5′ untranslated region and 1,458 bp of coding region without the TAG stop codon) was synthesized in frame with 717 bp of sGFP by GeneArt Gene Synthesis (Life Technologies, Canada), in which a ten-residue flexible polypeptide linker (GGGGSGGGGS) was inserted before sGFP, and cloned into a modified pZP121 binary vector[b57]. The resulting SCL15pro::SCL15-sGFP construct was used to transform homozygous scl15-1 mutant plants. Multiple independent transgenic lines that displayed a 3:1 segregation ratio in T2 populations were selected. The T3 homozygous lines Compl-6 and Compl-8 were chosen for the complementation assays. For subcellular localization of the SCL15:smRS-GFP fusion, transiently transformed N. tabacum leaves were incubated with 50 μg ml−1 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI; Life Technologies) for nuclei staining. Leaf tissues were stained with DAPI for 30 min. GFP signal was observed on a Zeiss Axio Imager Z1 microscope with ApoTome and AxioCam MRm and AxioVision Rel. 4.7 Imaging System (Carl Zeiss) with excitation of 490 and 383 nm for GFP and DAPI, respectively. The images shown are representative of at least three independent experiments. For SCL15pro::GUS activity assay, whole Arabidopsis seedlings or individual organs were incubated with GUS staining solution (10 mM phosphate buffer, 10 mM EDTA, 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 1 mM potassium ferricyanide, 1 mM potassium ferrocyanide, 1 mg per 1 ml of X-Gluc (5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-D-glucuronide) from 50 mg ml−1 stock in dimethylformamide). Samples were mounted in water under a coverslip and viewed using a Zeiss Axio Imager Z1 microscope. For histological analysis of transverse sections of Arabidopsis tissues, GUS staining was performed as described by Sieburth and Meyerowitz[b61]. Images were captured using an Axioplan Universal microscope with a Digital CCD camera and AxioCam ICc 1 and AxioVision Release 4.7 software. For anatomical analysis of SCL15pro::SCL15-sGFP plants, whole seedlings were stained briefly with 10 μg ml−1 propidium iodide (Sigma-Aldrich), mounted in water under glass coverslips, and visualized on a Zeiss Axio Imager Z1 microscope with ApoTome and AxioCam MRm software. The excitation wavelengths for GFP and propidium iodide were 561 nm and 488 nm, respectively. Wild-type Col-0 and scl15-1 seeds were sterilized and sown onto 1/2 MS agar-sucrose plates. Total RNA was isolated from 14-day-old seedlings using the RNeasy Plant mini kit (Qiagen). An Arabidopsis 70-mer oligo-gene array containing 26,090 annotated genes was used for microarray analysis. The GeneChip arrays were developed by Qiagen/Operon and printed on Super Amine slides (Telechem International) at the Microarray and Proteomics Facility, University of Alberta, Edmonton, AB, Canada. Total RNA was amplified and probe was labelled using an Ambion Amino Allyl MessageAmp II RNA amplification kit (Ambion) according to the manufacturer's instructions as described previously[b62]. Total RNA from three independent biological replicates were used. Briefly, fluorescent cDNA probes were synthesized from RNA and labelled with Cy3- or Cy5-dCTP using CyDye Post-Labelling Reactive Dye Packs (GE Healthcare). Hybridization and washing were performed according to the Corning Epoxide Coated Slides instruction manual (Corning Life Sciences). The labelled antisense RNA was fragmented in Ambion's fragmentation buffer (Applied Biosystems). After addition of 45 μl of DIG Easy Hybridization solution (Roche, Diagnostics) and 3 μl of blocking buffer (GE Healthcare) followed by incubation for 2 min at 65 °C, samples were hybridized for 16–18 h at 37 °C using a MAUI hybridization system (BioMicro Systems). Microarray images were analysed using Array-Pro Analyzer software (Media Cybernetics). The data were then extracted, log transformed, quantile normalized and corrected for background using Robust Multiarray Analysis. Statistical analysis of gene expression data was based on the Student's t-test (P≤0.05) and a Benjamini-Hochberg false discovery rate multiple testing correction with cutoff of 0.05 (ref. [b63]). Differentially expressed genes were considered to be those exhibiting at least a twofold change. GO categories that were significantly over-represented among upregulated genes in the scl15-1 seedlings were determined using the Biological Network Gene Ontology tool 2.4 (BiNGO 2.4) plugin[b34] for Cytoscape 2.8 (ref. [b64]) with default settings (hypergeometric test and a Benjamini-Hochberg multiple testing correction[b63]). Total RNA was extracted from Arabidopsis seedlings or siliques using the RNeasy Plant Mini Kit (Qiagen) and genomic DNA was eliminated from RNA samples with DNase I (amplilification grade; Life Technologies). Total RNA was reversed transcribed using the SuperScript III First-Strand Synthesis SuperMix for qRT–PCR (Life Technologies) following the manufacturer's instructions. Real-time RT–PCR was performed using the Platinum SYBR Green qPCR SuperMix-UDG (Life Technologies) on an ABI Prism StepOnePlus Real-time PCR System (Applied Biosystems) or using the SsoFast EvaGreen Supermix (Bio-Rad) in a CFX96 Touch Real-Time PCR Detection System (Bio-Rad) according to the manufacturer's instructions. ACT2 and Ef-1α were used as the reference genes. Each pair of primers produced a single amplicon of the expected size and melting temperature. The gene-specific primers for LEC1, ABI3, CRU3, RAB18, Oleo2, Ef-1α and ACT2 have been described previously[b23] and those for other genes are listed in [S1]. Data were analysed using the StepOne Software v2.0 (Applied Biosystems) or the CFX Manager 3.1 (Bio-Rad). All samples were run with triplicate and results present are the mean (±s.d.) of three biological replicates. Arabidopsis 12S globulin was purified by HPLC and a monoclonal anti-12S globulin CRA1 was generated by the Animal Care Unit, Western College of Veterinary Medicine, University of Saskatchewan, Saskatoon, Canada. 12S globulin were purified from leaves of 2-week-old Col-0 and scl15-1 plants following treatment with or without 50 μM ABA for 2 days by employing a RuBisCO depletion and antibody-capture technique. Briefly, 100 μg of ground leaf tissues was combined with 500 μl protein extraction buffer (7 M urea, 2 M thiourea, 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 9.0, 0.2% Triton X-100, one Complete Protease Inhibitor Cocktail Tablet (Roche Diagnostics) per 30 ml). Following homogenization with a micropestle and centrifugation at 7,800g at 4 °C for 20 min, supernatants were clarified by passage through a 0.45-μm syringe filter and centrifugation at 10,000g, 4 °C for 1 min. For each supernatant, 500 μg protein was subjected to Rubisco depletion using Seppro Rubisco Spin Columns (Sigma-Aldrich) and then used directly for antibody capture using rabbit anti-globulin polyclonal-coupled Dynabeads Protein G (Life Technologies) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Enriched 12S globulin species were eluted, boiled and resolved by 15% SDS–PAGE for silver staining and immunoblotting analysis. For detection of globulin species, a 1:1,000 dilution of monoclonal anti-CRA1 antibody and a 1:5,000 dilution of anti-mouse-HRP (Bio-Rad,Catalogue #170–6516) were employed along with Immobilon Western Chemiluminescence HRP Substrate (Millipore) according to the manufacturer's instructions. A full scan of the immunoblot is presented in [S1].
