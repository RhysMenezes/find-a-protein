!~ABS~! The class IV homeodomain leucine zipper transcription factor GLABRA2 (GL2) acts in a complex regulatory circuit that regulates the differentiation of trichomes in Arabidopsis thaliana. We describe a genetic interaction with HOMEODOMAIN GLABROUS11 (HDG11), previously identified as a negative regulator of trichome branching. gl2 hdg11 double mutants display enhanced trichome cell-type differentiation defects. Transgenic expression of HDG11 using the GL2 promoter partially suppresses gl2 trichome phenotypes. Vice versa, expression of GL2 under the control of its native promoter partially complements hdg11 ectopic branching. Since gl2 hdg11 and gl2 myb23 double mutants and the triple mutant display similar trichome differentiation defects, we investigated a connection to the R2R3-MYB transcription factor MYB23. We show that MYB23 transcript levels are significantly reduced in shoots from gl2 mutants and that GL2 can drive the expression of a MYB23-promoter fusion to green fluorescent protein. Yeast one-hybrid, chromatin immunoprecipitation, and in planta reporter gene experiments indicate that an L1-box in the MYB23 promoter acts as a GL2 binding site. Taken together, our findings reveal a functional redundancy between GL2 and HDG11, two homeodomain leucine zipper transcription factors previously thought to mediate opposing functions in trichome morphogenesis. A model is proposed in which GL2 transcript levels are maintained through a positive feedback loop involving GL2 activation of MYB23.
!~RES~! GL2 and HDG11 are linked loci on Arabidopsis chromosome 1. Phylogenetic analysis of the 16 members of the class IV HD-Zip family does not reveal a high degree of relatedness between GL2 and HDG11 in comparison with other family members (CITATION). To further probe sequence similarity between GL2 and HDG11, we divided their protein sequences into four distinct conserved domains: (1) HD, (2) ZLZ, (3) START, and (4) START adjacent domain (SAD) (Figures 1A and 1B). The N-terminal HD implicated in DNA binding is followed by the ZLZ plant-specific Leu zipper dimerization domain conserved among members of the class IV family (CITATION). The START domain implicated in ligand binding (CITATION; CITATION) lies in the middle, followed by the SAD of unknown function at the C terminus. We determined the percentage amino acid identities and similarities between the four domains of the two proteins in pairwise alignments from protein–protein BLAST (Figure 1B) and found the HD domain to be most conserved, exhibiting 74 and 89% identity and similarity, respectively (Figure 1C). Pairwise alignments were used to compare the HD domain of GL2 with each of the 15 other members of the class IV HD-Zip family (Supplemental Table 1). Ranking by amino acid identity to GL2, HDG11 placed first, followed by HDG5 and PROTODERMAL FACTOR2 (PDF2). Among the other class IV members whose mRNA transcripts are expressed in leaf trichomes (HDG2, HDG11, and HDG12), HDG11 exhibits the highest degree of amino acid identity and similarity to GL2. [[FIGURE]] Crosses between gl2-5 and hdg11-1 plants of the Columbia (Col) ecotype were performed to construct homozygous double mutants. In comparison with gl2-5 single mutants, the double mutants exhibited enhanced trichome differentiation defects (Figure 2). Trichome phenotypes were visualized on rosette leaves by stereomicroscopy (Figures 2A to 2D). Leaf trichome morphologies were observed under higher magnification using scanning electron microscopy (Figures 2E to 2T). While trichome initiation appears not to be altered in gl2-5 single and gl2-5 hdg11-1 double mutants, outgrowth and differentiation of the trichomes are affected. Trichomes are generally aborted on leaves from gl2-5 mutants, whereas trichomes at the leaf margins are more differentiated and typically branched with two (or rarely three) branches. Quantification of trichome outgrowth revealed a significant difference in the number of branched trichomes at the leaf margins in gl2-5 mutants versus gl2-5 hdg11-1 double mutants (Figure 2U; Supplemental Table 2). We observed ectopic branching in hdg11-1 mutants, as reported previously (CITATION). On first leaves, trichomes with five branches or more were very rare in wild-type Col (∼0.4%), while hdg11-1 mutants exhibited ∼13% of the total trichomes with five or more branches. In contrast, in gl2-5 hdg11-1 double mutants, there was a complete absence of branched trichomes, while gl2-5 mutants displayed branched trichomes among ∼11% of the total trichomes on first leaves. Trichomes also form on the epidermis of sepals from Arabidopsis flowers. Analogous deviations in trichome morphogenesis were detected on sepals of hdg11-1 and gl2-5 mutants (Supplemental Figure 1). Wild-type sepals exhibited unbranched trichomes, while hdg11-1 sepals showed both unbranched and branched trichomes. gl2-5 mutants exhibited fewer and smaller trichomes, while gl2-5 hdg11-1 mutants typically lacked trichomes on sepals. [[FIGURE]] Using the Landsberg erecta (Ler) ecotype as the genetic background, we crossed gl2-1 and hdg11-3 mutants to produce the corresponding double mutant plants (Supplemental Figure 2). The quantitative difference between trichome branching on first leaves for gl2-1 single mutants versus gl2-1 hdg11-3 double mutants was more striking in the Ler genetic background as compared with the Col ecotype (Supplemental Figure 2M and Supplemental Table 2). We also constructed gl2-5 hdg11-3 double mutants and found their trichome cell-type differentiation defects enhanced in comparison with gl2-5 siblings (Supplemental Figure 3). Previously it was shown that the trichome differentiation defect of gl2 mutants is enhanced in a double mutant for the Col alleles gl2-4AA and myb23-2 (CITATION). It was reported that myb23 mutants exhibit reduced trichome branching but no obvious defect in trichome patterning (CITATION) and display smaller trichomes (CITATION). We confirmed the previously reported trichome defects using the myb23-3 mutant allele (Figure 3). The gl2-5 myb23-3 double mutant was constructed, and enhanced trichome defects were confirmed for this new allelic combination in the Col ecotype. Similar to gl2 hdg11 mutants, gl2-5 myb23-3 mutants exhibited trichomes that were distinctly smaller and less expanded than gl2-5 trichomes, and this was especially apparent at the leaf margins (Figures 3A to 3D). Using scanning electron microscopy to view trichome morphologies in detail, we observed trichome differentiation defects in gl2-5 myb23-3 mutants that were analogous to those seen in gl2 hdg11 mutants (Figures 2 and 3E to 3L). Quantification of the trichome defects on first leaves indicated that while ∼11% of the total trichomes in gl2-5 mutants were branched, none of the trichomes in the gl2-5 myb23-3 mutants were branched (Figure 3M; Supplemental Table 2). [[FIGURE]] Given the similarity between the leaf trichome phenotypes of gl2 hdg11 and gl2 myb23 double mutants, we investigated genetic interactions between hdg11 and myb23 in the gl2 background. If the hdg11 and myb23 mutations affect the same biological pathway in the absence of GL2, then the triple mutant gl2 hdg11 myb23 would be expected to display similar trichome differentiation defects to either double mutant. Indeed, we found that the gl2-5 hdg11-1 myb23-3 triple mutant displays a trichome phenotype resembling the double mutants (Figures 3N to 3P). Quantification of trichomes on first leaves indicated that the triple mutant has a phenotype that is indistinguishable from gl2-5 myb23-3 (Figure 3Q), and examination of first leaves by scanning electron microscopy shows striking similarity between the double and triple mutants (Supplemental Figure 4). During construction of the triple mutant, we observed trichome defects in the F1 progeny from reciprocal crosses between gl2 hdg11 and gl2 myb23, whose genotype was homozygous for gl2-5 and heterozygous for both hdg11-1 and myb23-3 (Supplemental Figure 5). Unlike gl2 mutants that exhibit trichomes on leaf margins, the gl2/gl2 hdg11/+ myb23/+ plants exhibited enhanced trichome defects similar to those of gl2 hdg11 and gl2 myb23 double mutants (Supplemental Figures 5A to 5F). Unexpectedly, we also uncovered fertility defects that were associated with inviable pollen from plants heterozygous for hdg11-1 or myb23-3 or both. However, these phenotypes were found to be independent of GL2 (Supplemental Figures 5G to 5L). Double mutants for hdg11 and myb23 were found to exhibit an intermediate trichome phenotype, lacking the ectopic branching of hdg11 mutants, while showing significantly fewer two-branched trichomes than myb23 mutants (Supplemental Figure 6 and Supplemental Table 2). This suggests that in the presence of GL2, HDG11 and MYB23 act in parallel to orchestrate trichome cell differentiation, and MYB23 is not required for this inhibitory function of HDG11. After establishing the enhanced trichome cell differentiation defects in gl2 hdg11 double mutants, we investigated phenotypes in roots and seeds, other tissues that are affected in gl2 single mutants. In the root epidermis, gl2 mutants exhibit an increase in the proportion of cells that are specified for root hair fate (CITATION). We observed excess root hair formation on primary roots of gl2 hdg11 double mutants from both the Col and Ler backgrounds but did not detect an enhanced defect as compared with gl2 single mutants (Figures 4A to 4D and 4N; Supplemental Figure 7 and Supplemental Table 3). gl2 mutants also exhibit a defect in the production of seed coat mucilage upon imbibition (CITATION). Using ruthenium red staining for pectin in the seed coat mucilage, we observed that gl2 hdg11 double mutants lack the mucilage layer in a manner that is indistinguishable from gl2 single mutants (Figures 4A′ to 4D′; Supplemental Figure 7). In addition to defects in the epidermis, gl2 mutants accumulate higher levels of oil in the seed (CITATION), and this phenotype is associated with the lack of seed coat mucilage (CITATION). We also found that gl2 hdg11 double mutants display a similar increase in seed oil levels to gl2 single mutants (Supplemental Figure 8). Similarly, examination of gl2 myb23 mutants for root hair and seed mucilage phenotypes revealed no obvious enhanced or novel phenotypes relative to the gl2 single mutants, consistent with the idea that the genetic interaction with MYB23 is also specific to trichomes (Figure 4; Supplemental Table 3). [[FIGURE]] We used the 2.1-kb promoter upstream of GL2 to express HDG11 in trichomes from hdg11, gl2, and gl2 hdg11 mutants (Figure 5). An N-terminal enhanced yellow fluorescence protein (EYFP) tag was used to monitor the expression of HDG11 in transgenic lines. As a control, we utilized an hdg11 mutant construct that is missing the first 305 residues of the predicted protein and therefore lacking the HD and ZLZ domains as well as part of the START domain (Figure 5A). The trichome phenotypes of representative hdg11, gl2, and gl2 hdg11 lines, as visualized by scanning electron microscopy, were unchanged, indicating that this construct is null for HDG11 activity (Figures 5B to 5G). By contrast, scanning electron microscopy analysis showed that the wild-type ProGL2:EYFP:HDG11 construct fully complements the trichome-branching defect of hdg11-1 mutants (Figures 5H and 5K). Its expression was also sufficient to induce increased branching of trichomes at leaf margins in the gl2-5 hdg11-1 double mutant, consistent with complementation of the hdg11 mutant phenotype (Figures 5L and 5M; Supplemental Figures 9B, 9D, and 9F). However, the ProGL2:EYFP:HDG11 construct only partially rescued the trichome differentiation defect of gl2-5 mutants on first leaves (Figures 5I and 5J) and leaves from rosettes (Supplemental Figures 9A, 9C, and 9E). Unexpectedly, novel transient dwarf phenotypes were observed at the rosette stage for both gl2-5 and gl2-5 hdg11-1 mutants transformed with ProGL2:EYFP:HDG11 (Supplemental Figures 9G to 9L). [[FIGURE]] In all three genetic backgrounds, expression of the ProGL2:EYFP:HDG11 fusion protein was monitored in trichomes and found to be localized in nuclei of trichome cells (Figures 5N to 5S). Quantification of trichomes on first leaves revealed a significant difference in the branching and/or number of trichomes for mutant lines expressing ProGL2:EYFP:HDG11 (Figure 5T; Supplemental Table 2). For hdg11 mutant plants expressing the wild-type HDG11 transgene, ∼0.6% of trichomes had five or more branches in comparison with the control, in which ∼17% of the trichomes exhibited five or more branches. Thus, expression of HDG11 under the control of the GL2 promoter is sufficient for rescue of the hdg11 branching phenotype. In gl2 mutant plants expressing the wild-type EYFP:HDG11 transgene, an ∼3.3-fold increase in average trichome numbers and more branching (∼48 versus ∼27% in the control) on first leaves were observed, but overall trichome formation was partial in comparison with the wild type. For the gl2-5 hdg11-1 double mutant, branching and trichome cell-type differentiation were restored to approximately the levels in gl2-5 mutants, as indicated by an ∼35-fold increase in visible trichomes and more branching (∼44 versus 0% in the control). We also expressed HDG11 in gl2-5 mutants using the epidermis-specific ∼3.4-kb ATML1 promoter from class IV HD-Zip transcription factor ATML1 (Supplemental Figure 10). ProATML1:HDG11 transgenic lines exhibited increased trichome cell-type differentiation in comparison with untransformed gl2-5 control plants. However, the trichome cell-type differentiation was partial, resulting in an increase in mainly one- to two-branched and rarely three-branched trichomes (Supplemental Figures 10D to 10G). Additional phenotypes, such as leaf curling and novel pointy leaf shapes, were also observed in conjunction with trichome formation, suggesting that the ectopic expression of HDG11 either induces or interferes with other cell-type differentiation pathways in the epidermis. In roots, we detected a partial rescue of the excess root hair phenotype of gl2 mutants in transgenic lines expressing ProGL2:EYFP:HDG11 in comparison with the ProGL2:EYFP:hdg11Δ negative control (Figures 4H, 4L, and 4O; Supplemental Table 3). A complete rescue of the gl2 root hair phenotype was conferred by the ProGL2:EYFP:GL2 transgene (Figures 4J and 4O). This construct, in which EYFP-tagged GL2 is expressed under the control of its native promoter (Figure 6A), was shown previously to completely rescue the trichome defects of gl2-5 mutants (K. Schrick, B.P. Srinivas, and M. Hülskamp, unpublished data). The expression of mutant or wild-type ProGL2:EYFP:HDG11 did not alter the root hair phenotype of hdg11 mutants, which appears indistinguishable from that of the wild type (Figures 4G, 4K, and 4O). However, in seeds, the expression of ProGL2:EYFP:HDG11 in hdg11 had a negative effect on mucilage formation in comparison with the control, resulting in a “gl2” phenotype (Figures 4G′ and 4K′). Although ProGL2:EYFP:GL2 was able to complement the seed mucilage phenotype of gl2 (Figure 4J′), there was no visible rescue of the seed coat mucilage phenotype in gl2 mutants by the ProGL2:EYFP:HDG11 transgene (Figures 4H′, 4I′, 4L′, and 4M′). Taken together, these data indicate that the ability of HDG11 to partially rescue the gl2 phenotype and/or interfere with GL2 activity is tissue specific. [[FIGURE]] Since HDG11 overexpression in trichomes can partially rescue the trichome and root hair phenotypes of gl2, we asked whether GL2 overexpression is able to complement the ectopic branching phenotype of hdg11 mutants. We expressed ProGL2:EYFP:GL2 in hdg11 mutants and observed partial complementation of the ectopic branching phenotype (Figure 6). Scanning electron microscopy analysis showed that in comparison with the control lacking the transgene (Figures 6B and 6D), hdg11 mutants expressing ProGL2:EYFP:GL2 exhibited fewer trichomes having five or more branches. Expression of the transgene was associated with nuclear localization of the EYFP:GL2 protein in trichomes (Figures 6E and 6F). Quantification of trichomes on first leaves revealed a significant difference in hdg11 mutants expressing the transgene (∼20% ectopically branched trichomes) versus the controls lacking the transgene (∼3% ectopically branched trichomes) (Figure 6H; Supplemental Table 2). Expression of the GL2 transgene also led to an increase in the average total number of trichomes on first leaves of hdg11 mutants (∼75 versus ∼45 in the control), suggesting that GL2 expression can drive trichome cell-type specification in the absence of HDG11. To further dissect the genetic interactions between GL2, HDG11, and MYB23, we monitored their respective mRNA transcripts in seedlings from the Col wild type, gl2-5, hyd11-1, and myb23-3 as well as the gl2 hdg11 and gl2 myb23 double mutants. mRNA was isolated from 14-d-old seedling shoots to enrich for transcript levels in trichomes. Quantitative real-time PCR confirmed that the gl2-5 and hdg11-1 alleles are RNA knockdown alleles, while myb23-3 mutants do not exhibit a reduced level of mRNA expression in shoots (Figures 7A to 7C). It was shown previously that for root tips from myb23-3, transcript levels in myb23-3 are reduced to ∼58% of wild-type levels (CITATION). The myb23-3 root hair phenotype was reported to be indistinguishable from that of the transcript-null allele myb23-1, indicating that although a transcript is expressed in myb23-3, it is not functional (CITATION). HDG11 mRNA levels were decreased only in hdg11-1 and gl2-5 hdg11-1 (Figure 7A). By contrast, our analysis revealed that MYB23 mRNA levels were significantly reduced in gl2-5 single mutants (∼5-fold) as well as in gl2-5 hdg11-1 and gl2-5 myb23-3 double mutants (Figure 7B). [[FIGURE]] The real-time PCR data are consistent with the possibility that MYB23 is a direct transcriptional target of GL2. Previously, it was shown that a ProMYB23:MYB23 construct containing the MYB23 promoter (3.1 kb N terminal to the start codon and 1.0 kb C terminal to the stop codon) was sufficient to rescue the trichome defect in myb23-1 mutants (CITATION). The 3.1-kb promoter of MYB23 contains two putative L1-boxes (Figure 7D) that are heptamer/octamer elements shown to be required for DNA binding of GL2 (CITATION; CITATION). The first, L1-box I, located ∼2.4 kb upstream of the start codon of MYB23, is a perfect match, in reverse orientation, to the L1-box (TAAATGTA) described for the GL2-regulated CELLULOSE SYNTHASE5 (CESA5) and XYLOGLUCAN ENDOTRANSGLUCOSYLASE/HYDROLASE17 (XTH17) promoters (CITATION). The second, L1-box II (TAAATGTG), located 76 bp downstream from L1-box I, has a one-base mismatch (G) adjacent to the conserved heptamer sequence. We used a yeast one-hybrid assay to test whether GL2 is able to bind to the L1-box motifs found in the MYB23 promoter (Figures 7E and 7F). The results indicate that GL2 binds to the wild-type L1-box I sequence but not a mutated version thereof. In contrast, GL2 was not able to bind to the imperfect sequence represented by L1-box II. We also examined whether HDG11 is able to bind to the motifs and failed to detect binding activity to either L1-box. The experiments indicate that GL2 binds one of the L1-boxes in the MYB23 promoter, whereas HDG11 is unable to bind that same sequence in the yeast system. The L1-box motifs in the MYB23 promoter were compared with motifs identified for other known direct targets of GL2 (CESA5, PHOSPHOLIPASE D ζ1, and XTH17) (Figure 8A) (CITATION; CITATION). To further test the idea that GL2 binds to an L1-box in the MYB23 promoter, we performed chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) on seedlings from a ProGL2:EYFP:GL2 transgenic line (Figure 8B). Using an anti–green fluorescent protein (GFP) antibody to purify protein-DNA complexes containing EYFP:GL2, we isolated ChIP DNA and performed quantitative real-time PCR. The results indicate that DNA containing the L1-box region of the MYB23 promoter is enriched to a similar level as a positive control, DNA corresponding to an L1-box–containing region from the CESA5 promoter. The percentage input values are significantly increased relative to the ACT7 negative control, indicating that GL2 binds to both the MYB23 and CESA5 promoters in seedlings. [[FIGURE]] To test whether L1-box I is required for transcriptional activation of MYB23 by GL2, we transiently expressed a reporter composed of the 3.1-kb promoter upstream of MYB23 fused to GFP in Nicotiana benthamiana. Low levels of GFP fluorescence were observed in controls that expressed the reporter alone (Figures 8C and 8I). A marked increase in GFP fluorescence was observed in epidermal cells that coexpressed GL2 (Figures 8D and 8I). However, no activation above the basal level was detected for cells that coexpressed HDG11 (Figures 8E, 8H, and 8I). An ∼2-fold decrease in activation by GL2 was observed for a mutant reporter that lacked L1-box I (Figures 8G and 8I), indicating that the L1-box is required for maximal activation. A naturally occurring mutation is found within L1-box I of the Arabidopsis accession Guckingen-0 (Gu-0) (Supplemental Figure 11A). Hierarchical clustering based on pairwise sequence differences among 96 accessions indicated that Col is the most closely related accession to Gu-0 (CITATION). Strikingly, we observed significantly fewer four-branched trichomes on first leaves from Gu-0 in comparison with Col (Supplemental Figures 11B to 11F), consistent with compromised MYB23 function. Real-time PCR experiments indicated that Gu-0 shoots express lower levels of MYB23 transcripts (Supplemental Figures 11G to 11I), consistent with a function for L1-box I in the full activation of MYB23 by GL2.
!~MM~! The wild-type Arabidopsis thaliana ecotypes were Col and Ler. The hdg11-1 (Col) (SAIL_865_G09) (CITATION) and hdg11-3 (Ler) alleles were described previously (CITATION). The myb23-3 (Col) (SALK_018613) allele contains a T-DNA insertion in the 5′ promoter (CITATION). gl2-1 (Ler) is a fast-neutron–induced allele (CITATION; CITATION). gl2-5 (Col) is a En-1 insertion allele of GL2 (CITATION). The genomic region was sequenced using En205 and En8130 primers (CITATION) and GL2-specific primers (CITATION), revealing an insertion following the Ser-encoded triplet AGC (bases 121 to 123), after the first 37 amino acids of the predicted protein. A TGA stop codon is located 29 amino acids downstream, within the En-1 transposon, indicating that the mutant allele results in a truncated protein of 63 amino acids, of which the first 37 amino acids are derived from the N terminus of GL2. En-1 lies at the beginning (33 bp) of the second exon of the gene, upstream of the HD (amino acids 106 to 157). Supplemental Table 4 lists oligonucleotides used for genotyping. Plants were stratified at 4°C for 3 to 5 d and grown on soil containing Metro-Mix 380, vermiculite, and perlite (Hummert International) in a 7:3:2 ratio at 23°C under continuous light. Agrobacterium tumefaciens (GV3101 pMP90)–mediated transformation of plants was performed using the floral dip method as described previously (CITATION). Construction of ProGL2:EYFP:GL2 (SR54, a derivative of the binary vector pCAMBIA1300) will be described elsewhere (A. Khosla, B.K.P. Venkata, P.N. Cox, D.F. Stucky, P.M. Stephens, S.A. Marlatt, B.P. Srinivas, M. Hülskamp, and K. Schrick, unpublished data). An HDG11 cDNA clone was obtained from the RIKEN Arabidopsis full-length clone collection. Internal SalI and KpnI restriction sites interfering with the cloning scheme were removed prior to amplification by site-directed mutagenesis using a one-step PCR-based method as described previously (CITATION). To construct ProGL2:EYFP:HDG11, the cDNA sequences for wild-type HDG11 and hdg11Δ305 were PCR amplified with Phusion High-Fidelity DNA Polymerase (Thermo Scientific) using primers engineered to contain SalI and KpnI restriction sites at the 5′ and 3′ ends, respectively. hdg11Δ305 (referred to as hdg11Δ in Figures 4 and 5) is a deletion mutant missing the N-terminal 305 residues of the predicted protein, resulting in an in-frame 417 amino acid protein that lacks the first 78 residues of the START domain. The amplified PCR fragment was restriction digested with SalI/KpnI and subcloned into the corresponding restriction sites in binary vector SR54 to make ProGL2:EYFP:HDG11 and ProGL2:EYFP:hdg11Δ305. The constructs were transformed into the gl2-5 and hdg11-1 single mutant and gl2-5 hdg11-1 double mutant plants. For ProGL2:EYFP:HDG11, Mendelian segregation of EYFP fluorescence was seen for the T2 progeny from 6 of 19 hdg11-1, 29 of 43 gl2-5, and 28 of 34 gl2-5 hdg11-1 plants. Strong EYFP expression was observed in trichomes from 3 hdg11-1, 16 gl2-5, and 9 gl2-5 hdg11-1 lines carrying ProGL2:EYFP:HDG11. For the ProGL2:EYFP:hdg11Δ construct, none of the transgenic lines from a total of 75 (20 in hdg11, 15 in gl2, and 40 in gl2 hdg11) independent transformants exhibited EYFP expression. The ProATML1:HDG11 construct was made using pAR176 (CITATION). The HDG11 cDNA was cloned into pENTR-D-TOPO (Life Technologies) and moved into pAR176 by Gateway LR Clonase II (Life Technologies). For ProATML1:HDG11, ∼150 T1 plants survived BASTA selection, 24 independent trichome-bearing transformants were characterized, and 8 of 24 T1 progeny segregated in a Mendelian fashion. Oligonucleotides used for plasmid construction, site-directed mutagenesis, and sequence verification are listed in Supplemental Table 4. Arabidopsis seeds were surface-sterilized and sown onto 0.8% (plant tissue culture grade) agar containing 1× Murashige and Skoog medium (CITATION), 1% Suc, and 0.5% MES buffer at pH 5.8. Seeds were stratified for 3 to 5 d at 4°C and then transferred to 23°C and continuous light for 14 d. After removal of roots and hypocotyl, shoots were flash frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80°C. Approximately 50 mg of each sample was used for RNA extraction using the RNeasy Plant Mini Kit and on-column RNase-Free DNase Set (Qiagen). Furthermore, 0.5 to 2 μg of RNA was used as a template for cDNA synthesis. cDNA synthesis was performed using SuperScript II Reverse Transcriptase (Life Technologies) or GoScript Reverse Transcriptase (Promega) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Real-time PCR was performed using IQ SYBR Green Supermix with the CFX96 Touch Real-Time PCR Detection System (Bio-Rad). Each reaction contained 10 μL of 2× SYBR Green Supermix, 1 μL of forward and reverse 10 mM gene-specific primers, and 5 μL of cDNA (diluted 5-fold) in 20 µL. Standard curves were generated from 10-fold dilutions of amplicons for each primer pair. ACT7 served as the reference gene. The data represent three biological samples of three to four seedling shoots per sample with three technical replicates of each biological replicate. Primers used for PCR are listed in the Supplemental Table 4. Arabidopsis lines were confirmed by PCR and assayed for leaf trichomes, seed coat mucilage, and root hairs. For root hair density analysis, seedlings were grown vertically on 0.8% agar/water medium under continuous light. Primary roots were viewed 3 to 4 d after germination. For quantification of root epidermal cells, seedlings were stained in a 0.05% aqueous solution of toluidine blue, destained in water, mounted in 10% glycerol, and examined for the numbers of trichoblasts and atrichoblasts in the corresponding respective cell files. For seed mucilage analysis, seeds were stained with a 0.02% aqueous solution of ruthenium red (Sigma) for 2 h followed by replacement with deionized water prior to observation. Seeds, rosettes, and roots were imaged with a Leica M125 fluorescence stereomicroscope, and images were captured using a Leica DFC295 digital camera and Leica Application Suite 4.1. For the quantification of trichomes on first leaves, the leaves were placed on 1% agar plates and counting of trichomes on first leaves was performed manually upon viewing with the stereomicroscope. Scanning electron microscopy imaging was performed on fresh leaves and sepals using cold stage (−30°C) with an S-3500N instrument from Hitachi Science Systems equipped with an S-6542 Absorbed Electron Detector, a C1005 SEM Cold/Hot Stage (Oxford Instruments Microanalysis), and backscattered Robinson detector (ETP-USA/Electron Detectors). Images were processed as TIF files using Adobe Photoshop CS4. Three tandem copies of L1-box sequences and mutated versions thereof were cloned into the pAbAi vector (Clontech) by annealing of oligonucleotides having KpnI and SalI restriction sites at their ends. Reporter bait constructs were integrated into the yeast genome at the ura3-52 locus using URA3+ selection in the yeast strain SUB62 (MATa lys2-801 leu2-3, 2-112 ura3-52 his3-Δ200 trp1-1). Reporter strains were transformed by standard LiAc transformation with pGAD-T7 (Clontech) containing HD and ZLZ domains from GL2 (amino acids 1 to 231) or HDG11 (amino acids 1 to 169) that been inserted using the EcoRI and BamHI restriction sites. A construct containing the C-terminal START and SAD domains of GL2 (amino acids 253 to 747), also inserted by these restriction sites, was used as a control. Oligonucleotide sequences for this work are listed in Supplemental Table 4. Transgenic seeds expressing ProGL2:EYFP:GL2 were germinated on 0.8% (plant tissue culture grade) agar containing 1× Murashige and Skoog medium (CITATION), and seedlings were harvested at 10 d. Cross-linking of seedlings followed by extraction of chromatin were performed as described (CITATION) with minor modifications. Chromatin was sonicated with the S220 Focused-Ultrasonicator (Covaris) to <500-bp DNA fragments. A 10-fold dilution of total chromatin was prepared to serve as the input control. Immunoprecipitations were performed overnight at 4°C with 2 μL of anti-GFP antibody (ab290; Abcam) bound to Dynabeads Protein A (Life Technologies). After washing sequentially with low-salt wash buffer (150 mM NaCl, 0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mM EDTA, and 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8), high-salt wash buffer (500 mM NaCl and otherwise identical to the first buffer), LiCl buffer (0.25 mM LiCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 1 mM EDTA, and 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8), and TE buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8, and 1 mM EDTA), the immunocomplexes were eluted. Cross-linking was reversed by overnight incubation at 65°C, followed by proteinase K digestion, phenol-chloroform extraction, and ethanol precipitation. ChIP DNA was quantified using iTaq Universal SYBR Green Supermix with the CFX96 Touch Real-Time PCR Detection System (Bio-Rad). PCR was performed in triplicate with the gene-specific primers listed in Supplemental Table 4. ACT7 was used for normalization. The ProMYB23:mGFP5-ER reporter contains the 3.1-kb MYB23 promoter driving the expression of an endoplasmic reticulum–targeted modified GFP (mGFP-ER) in pCB302 (CITATION). To construct ProMYB23_∆L1:mGFP5-ER, L1-box I was deleted using the Q5 Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit (New England Biolabs) using the oligonucleotides listed in Supplemental Table 4. To construct the Pro35S:GL2 and Pro35S:HDG11 effector genes, cDNA sequences for GL2 and HDG11 were PCR amplified using Phusion High-Fidelity DNA Polymerase (Thermo Scientific), cloned into pENTR-D-TOPO (Life Technologies), and moved to the pK7WG2 expression vector by Gateway LR Clonase II (Life Technologies). N. benthamiana plants (2 to 4 weeks old) were used to express the various construct combinations by Agrobacterium (GV3101 pMP90)–mediated transient transformation of lower epidermal leaf cells as described previously (CITATION). Fluorescence images were captured using a Zeiss LSM 5 PASCAL system at 3 d postinfiltration. GFP was excited at 488 nm and detected at 493 to 530 nm. Images of 512 × 512 pixels over an area of 307.1 × 307.1 μm were analyzed from three biological replicates for each effector and reporter combination. Quantification of the image data was performed by calculating the percentage of the measurement area for which the relative GFP fluorescence exceeded a threshold of 20% of the maximum overall signal intensity.
