!~ABS~! Plant cell wall proteins are important regulators of cell wall architecture and function. However, because cell wall proteins are difficult to extract and analyze, they are generally poorly understood. Here, we describe the identification and characterization of proteins integral to the Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) seed coat mucilage, a specialized layer of the extracellular matrix composed of plant cell wall carbohydrates that is used as a model for cell wall research. The proteins identified in mucilage include those previously identified by genetic analysis, and several mucilage proteins are reduced in mucilage-deficient mutant seeds, suggesting that these proteins are genuinely associated with the mucilage. Arabidopsis mucilage has both nonadherent and adherent layers. Both layers have similar protein profiles except for proteins involved in lipid metabolism, which are present exclusively in the adherent mucilage. The most abundant mucilage proteins include a family of proteins named TESTA ABUNDANT1 (TBA1) to TBA3; a less abundant fourth homolog was named TBA-LIKE (TBAL). TBA and TBAL transcripts and promoter activities were detected in developing seed coats, and their expression requires seed coat differentiation regulators. TBA proteins are secreted to the mucilage pocket during differentiation. Although reverse genetics failed to identify a function for TBAs/TBAL, the TBA promoters are highly expressed and cell type specific and so should be very useful tools for targeting proteins to the seed coat epidermis. Altogether, these results highlight the mucilage proteome as a model for cell walls in general, as it shares similarities with other cell wall proteomes while also containing mucilage-specific features.
!~RES~! In order to identify and characterize proteins integral to the seed coat mucilage, a protocol was developed to extract seed coat mucilage for protein analyses (Fig. 1). Upon hydration, Arabidopsis seed coat epidermal cells extrude mucilage as two distinct layers: an outer nonadherent layer that detaches easily from the hydrated seed and a dense halo-like adherent layer that is bound tightly to the seed coat (Fig. 1A; CITATION). We took advantage of the different physical properties of these two layers to separate them by sequential extraction (Fig. 1B). Seeds imbibed in water were shaken gently to separate the nonadherent mucilage. The seeds were then shaken at high speed for several hours to remove the adherent mucilage (Fig. 1B). Ruthenium Red and Calcofluor White staining showed that the pectin and cellulosic components of seed coat mucilage were almost completely removed by the sequential extraction (Fig. 1B; Supplemental Fig. S1). The harvested adherent and nonadherent mucilage samples were chemically deglycosylated, trypsin digested, and analyzed by MS to identify mucilage-associated proteins in these samples (Fig. 1B; Supplemental Data Sets S1 and S2). Of those proteins detected by this process, only the ones identified in more than one biological replicate with MASCOT scores greater than 40 (where a score of 25 or greater corresponds to a 5% false discovery rate), and at least once with multiple peptides, were considered for further analyses. Based on these criteria, 30 proteins were considered to be robustly identified from mucilage, all containing predicted signal peptides (Supplemental Data Set S3). Cruciferin A1 and cruciferin C were discarded from further analyses, since they are not known to be secreted to the apoplast. This leaves a total 28 potential mucilage proteins identified (Table I; Supplemental Data Set S3). One protein was found only in the nonadherent layer, 15 only in the adherent layer, and the remaining 12 proteins were found in both mucilage layers (Table I). [[FIGURE]] When proteins found in each mucilage layer were sorted by their predicted functions (Table I; Fig. 2A), most fell within the various functional categories of cell wall proteins as defined by CITATION. These categories include carbohydrate-active enzymes, oxidoreductases, proteases, proteins involved in lipid metabolism, arabinogalactan proteins, as well as miscellaneous proteins and proteins with unknown functions. The fact that seed coat mucilage-associated proteins appear to be functionally similar to proteins from other Arabidopsis cell wall proteomes reinforces the concept that seed coat mucilage is a specialized type of cell wall (CITATION). On the other hand, nearly half of the specific mucilage-associated protein isoforms were unique to mucilage and not identified in other cell wall proteomes to date (Fig. 2B), including a family of unknown proteins (discussed below), RmlC-like cupin superfamily proteins, and GDSL lipases (Table I). Homologs of the RmlC-like cupin superfamily proteins and GDSL lipases are commonly found in other cell walls (CITATION), suggesting that these proteins may represent mucilage-specific isoforms. [[FIGURE]] In general, the adherent layer displays a richer and more diverse protein profile compared with the nonadherent layer, including 15 proteins that are unique to the adherent layer (Table I). Interestingly, this adherent-specific group includes a number of proteins involved in lipid metabolism (Fig. 2A). Otherwise, the numbers of proteins that belong to each predicted functional class are more or less comparable between the two mucilage layers (Fig. 2A). This suggests that the types of protein-mediated biological processes associated with mucilage modification in the apoplast are comparable within the two layers. Since the seeds from which mucilage was obtained in these experiments had not been processed in any way prior to hydration and mucilage extraction, the possibility remains that the proteins we identified originate from sources other than the mucilage. In order to address this concern, the nonadherent mucilage protein profiles obtained from Col-0 seeds were compared with protein profiles obtained from the seed surface extracts from the mucilage mutants mum2-10 and apetala 2-7 (ap2-7; Fig. 3A). mum2-10 seeds synthesize mucilage but do not extrude it when hydrated (CITATION; CITATION), whereas ap2-7 seed coat epidermal cells fail to differentiate and, therefore, do not synthesize mucilage (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION). Since mucilage can only be extracted from hydrated Col-0 seeds, proteins that are significantly overrepresented in Col-0 nonadherent mucilage compared with mum2-10 and/or ap2-7 seed surface extracts would be predicted to be derived from the extruded mucilage. Several mucilage proteins identified were indeed found at much higher levels in Col-0 compared with mum2-10 and ap2-7 (Fig. 3B; Supplemental Data Sets S4 and S5). Overall, the recovery of mucilage-associated protein was reduced by ∼90% when mum2-10 seed was used and by ∼99% when ap2-7 seed was used compared with Col-0 seed (Fig. 3B). These data support the hypothesis that proteins identified in this study are derived from extruded mucilage of seed coat epidermal cells and not from the primary wall. [[FIGURE]] The collection of enzymes identified by our proteomics analyses includes all the secreted enzymes required for normal mucilage extrusion that have been identified previously by genetic analysis: MUM2 (At5g63800/Q9FFN4; CITATION), BXL1 (At5g49360/Q9FGY1; CITATION), PER36 (At3g50990/Q9SD46; CITATION), and SBT1.7 (At5g67360/O65351; CITATION; Table I). Their identification here thus validates the robustness of the proteomic analysis. In an attempt to determine the roles of other mucilage proteins we identified, plant lines with T-DNA insertions in the genes β-GLUCOSIDASE44 (At3g18080/Q9LV33), β-HEXOSAMINIDASE3 (HEXO3; At1g65590/Q8L7S6), ASPARTIC PROTEASE IN GUARD CELL1 (ASPG1; At3g18490/Q9LS40), AUXIN INDUCIBLE IN ROOTS12 (At3g07390/Q94BT2), RESPONSIVE TO DEHYDRATION1a (RD21a; At1g47128/P43297), and SERINE CARBOXYPEPTIDASE-LIKE35 (At5g08260/Q9LEY1) were characterized (Supplemental Fig. S2; Supplemental Table S1). These genes were chosen because they do not appear to have homologs that are also expressed in seed coat epidermal cells, thus decreasing the possibility of functional redundancy obscuring mutant phenotypes. In each case, the T-DNA insertion decreased or eliminated the steady-state levels of transcript in homozygous lines (Supplemental Fig. S2). Seeds of each insertional mutant were imbibed in water, 0.05 m EDTA, 0.05 m CaCl2, or 0.5 m Na2CO3, stained with Ruthenium Red, and examined for seed mucilage abnormalities. EDTA is believed to loosen mucilage by disrupting the homogalacturonan salt bridges through Ca2+ chelation (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION; CITATION). Na2CO3 treatment also loosens mucilage, possibly by cleaving cross-linking ester bonds between homogalacturonan polymers (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION). In contrast, mucilage extruded in a CaCl2 solution is more compact and stains more intensely with Ruthenium Red than mucilage extruded in water, presumably by enhancing Ca2+ salt bridging between mucilage homogalacturonan molecules. However, no clear mucilage defects were found in any mucilage protein mutant lines under the conditions tested (Supplemental Fig. S3), suggesting that if the corresponding gene products have a role in mucilage modification, the mutant phenotype must be relatively subtle or conditional. Among the mucilage proteins identified, three proteins of the unknown protein family 0540 (UPF0540), At1g62000/Q39168, At1g62060/O04573, and At1g62080/O04575, were of particular interest because they were consistently identified as the most abundant proteins in almost all samples (Table I; Supplemental Data Set S4). Consistent with these protein data, the corresponding genes were found to be expressed in the seed coat at very high levels (Supplemental Fig. S4; CITATION; CITATION; CITATION; CITATION). However, the proteins encoded by these genes do not contain known functional domains other than putative signal peptides, so no function has been ascribed to them to date. Members of the UPF0540 protein family are strongly conserved, as they share 79% amino acid sequence identity and 81% similarity with one another (Fig. 4). Furthermore, the loci that encode these proteins are tightly clustered on chromosome 1, suggesting that the gene family may have expanded through tandem duplication events. Due to the abundance of the UPF0540 proteins in the seed coat, these genes were named TESTA ABUNDANT1 (TBA1; At1g62000/Q39168), TBA2 (At1g62060/O04573), and TBA3 (At1g62080/O04575). Interestingly, a peptide from a fourth member of the UPF0540 family, At1g62220/O04587, also was detected in adherent mucilage (Supplemental Data Sets S1 and S3). However, At1g62220/O04587 was identified with only one peptide with a score below the cutoff for statistical significance. Due to the strong similarities in amino acid sequences and expression patterns between At1g62220/O04587 and the TBA proteins, At1g62220/O04587 was named TBA-LIKE (TBAL). [[FIGURE]] TBAs are small proteins (∼150 amino acids) with many conserved Ser and Thr residues predicted by NetOGlyc to be O-glycosylated (CITATION; Fig. 4). These characteristics suggest that TBAs and TBAL may function as structural proteins that interact with various polysaccharides in seed coat mucilage. Public microarray data suggest that TBA and TBAL are expressed uniquely in the seed coat, and reverse transcription (RT)-PCR results are consistent with this pattern (Fig. 5). TBA and TBAL transcripts could only be detected in siliques (Fig. 5A) and, more specifically, in the 7- and 10-d post anthesis (DPA) seed coat (Fig. 5B). TBA2 expression levels are by far the highest and peaked at 7 DPA (coinciding with mucilage synthesis; Fig. 5B), whereas the expression levels of the remaining genes were lower and peaked at 10 DPA (coinciding with columella synthesis; Fig. 5B). [[FIGURE]] To verify the expression pattern of TBA and TBAL, reporter assays were performed on tissues of plants carrying chimeric genes encoding the GUS gene under the control of the TBA and TBAL native promoters. Consistent with RT-PCR data, GUS activity could be detected in developing seeds at 7 and 10 DPA (Fig. 6B) but not in seedlings, leaves, stems (Fig. 6A), and embryos (Fig. 6B). GUS under the control of TBA2p appeared earlier compared with other promoters, although in general, all TBA and TBAL promoters were active by 10 DPA (Fig. 6B). These data support the hypothesis that all four promoters are active primarily in the seed coat. The fact that the TBA promoter-GUS patterns mirror the presence of TBA transcripts implies that the expression of the TBA genes is largely regulated by their upstream cis-regulatory elements. [[FIGURE]] Several transcription factors are known to regulate the differentiation of seed coat epidermis and the synthesis of seed coat mucilage. Some of these master regulators include NAC-REGULATED SEED MORPHOLOGY1 (NARS1), NARS2, MUM1, MYELOBLASTOSIS61 (MYB61) and TRANSPARENT TESTA GLABRA1 (TTG1; CITATION; CITATION; CITATION; CITATION). Since the TBA genes are expressed exclusively in the seed coat, we asked whether they are under the control of these transcription factors. RT-PCR results showed that TBA and TBAL transcripts were absent in developing seeds of both the nars1 nars2 double mutant and ttg1-1 (Fig. 7), which suggests that NARS1/NARS2 and TTG1 are all required for TBA and TBAL expression. Intriguingly, TBA2 transcripts appear to be absent in the Landsberg erecta ecotype, suggesting that there may be TBA expression variation among different natural accessions. [[FIGURE]] The subcellular localization of TBAs was characterized using C-terminally tagged citrine-yellow fluorescent protein (cYFP) TBA translational fusion constructs driven by their endogenous promoters. In agreement with the expression data, cYFP signals were detected in the developing seed coat. No cYFP signal was observed in 4-DPA seeds (Fig. 8). By 6 DPA, TBA1-cYFP and TBA2-cYFP could be detected in the seed coat epidermal lateral cell walls and the developing mucilage pockets. All three TBAs could be detected in the mucilage pockets by 8 DPA (Fig. 8). By 10 DPA, the cYFP signal was absent from the mucilage pocket but was observed in the developing columella (Fig. 8). This expression pattern coincides spatiotemporally with the TBA transcript and promoter activity patterns (Figs. 5 and 6) and reinforces the characterization of TBA proteins as mucilage proteins. Furthermore, cYFP fluorescence was detected only in the outer epidermal layer of the seed coat (Fig. 8), suggesting that TBA proteins may only be synthesized in mucilage-secretory cells. [[FIGURE]] Despite the fact that TBAs were initially identified in mature mucilage, TBA-cYFP fluorescence was absent from mucilage pockets by 10 DPA, which raised the possibility that TBAs might be unstable proteins. To test this idea, immunoblot experiments were performed to try to detect TBA-cYFP extracted from developing siliques. Interestingly, full-length TBA-cYFP proteins were difficult to detect in the siliques of TBA-cYFP transgenic plants by immunoblotting. The abundance of TBA-cYFP was quite variable among different lines, and TBA3-cYFP appears to be partially insoluble (Supplemental Fig. S5). These results suggest that TBA-cYFP proteins are likely unstable and may undergo proteolysis or other posttranslational modification within the mucilage pocket. In an attempt to determine the function of the TBA proteins, we characterized tba loss-of-function mutants. Since the three TBA proteins are highly conserved and share a similar expression pattern, we anticipated that they might be functionally redundant. Furthermore, because all these genes are closely linked on the chromosome, the construction of double, triple, and quadruple tba mutants is relatively difficult. To overcome these problems, an artificial microRNA (amiRNA) driven by the UBIQUITIN EXTENSION PROTEIN1 promoter (UBQ1p) was designed to knock down all three TBA homologs and TBAL simultaneously. When TBA1 transcript levels in developing siliques were quantified in 12 UBQ1p:TBA-amiRNA transgenic lines, four lines showed significant down-regulation of TBA1, but only line 5 showed significant down-regulation in all three TBA genes and TBAL (Fig. 9A). However, none of the UBQ1p:TBA-amiRNA lines showed any mucilage defects when their seeds were imbibed in water, 0.05 m EDTA, 0.05 m CaCl2, or 0.5 m Na2CO3 followed by Ruthenium Red staining (Fig. 9B). These results suggest that either the TBA genes are functionally redundant, even at low levels of expression, or that the amiRNA knockdown lines possess mucilage phenotypes that are not clearly discernible with Ruthenium Red staining.

!~MM~! Most Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) plants used in this study were derived from the Col-0 ecotype, except for ttg1-1, which is derived from the Landsberg erecta ecotype. Seeds were germinated on plates with Arabidopsis medium (CITATION) at 7% agar and transferred to soil SunshineMix 4 (SunGro). Plants were grown with continuous fluorescent illumination of 80 to 140 µE m−2 s−1 at 20°C to 22°C. T-DNA insertion lines used in this study were obtained from the ABRC and are listed in Supplemental Table S1. T-DNA insertion lines were selected with a PCR-based assay using primers listed in Supplemental Table S2. Dry seeds (40 mg) were imbibed with 800 µL of double-distilled water in a microcentrifuge tube. The seeds were gently shaken on a tabletop shaker for 1 h at 120 rpm. Supernatants that contain the nonadherent mucilage were collected. The seeds were washed once with 200 µL of double-distilled water, which was pooled with the supernatant to form the nonadherent mucilage fraction. To obtain the adherent mucilage, 800 µL of double-distilled water was added to the seeds after extracting the nonadherent mucilage, and the seeds were secured horizontally to a tabletop vortex and shaken at top speed for 3 h. The supernatants containing the adherent mucilage were collected. The seeds were washed once with 200 µL of double-distilled water, which was pooled with the supernatant as the adherent layer fraction. The mucilage samples were freeze dried overnight and then chemically deglycosylated as described by CITATION. Briefly, 15 µL of anisole (Sigma-Aldrich) and 135 µL of trifluoromethanesulfonic acid (Sigma-Aldrich) were added to one freeze-dried mucilage sample in a Reacti-vial. The samples were sealed and incubated at 4°C for 2 h. Four microliters of 0.2% Bromophenol Blue was added to each sample, and 60% pyridine (Sigma-Aldrich) was added drop wise to each mucilage sample on ice until the solution turned light blue. The neutralized mucilage samples were dialyzed overnight in double-distilled water with dialysis tubing pore sizes of 3,500 to 5,000 D and then freeze dried overnight. Mucilage protein samples were resuspended in SDS-PAGE sample buffer and separated briefly on a 10% SDS-PAGE gel until all of the Mr markers just entered the resolving gel. The proteins were stained with blue silver (CITATION), and the entire lane was excised from the gel as one gel slice. Protein samples were analyzed by tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) at the Centre for High-Throughput Biology Proteomics Core Facility at the University of British Columbia. In brief, samples were subjected to reduction/alkylation with DTT/iodoacetamide followed by digestion with trypsin essentially as described by CITATION. The resulting peptides were desalted and concentrated with STAGE tips (CITATION) and analyzed by liquid chromatography-MS/MS on a linear-trapping quadrupole-Orbitrap mass spectrometer (LTQ Orbitrap Velos) online coupled to an Agilent 1290 series HPLC device using a nanospray ionization source (ThermoFisher Scientific) including a 2-cm-long 100-μm i.d. fused silica trap column, a 20-cm-long 50-μm i.d. fused silica fritted analytical column, and a 20-μm i.d. fused silica gold-coated spray tip (6-μm-diameter opening, pulled on a P-2000 laser puller from Sutter Instruments, coated on a Leica EM SCD005 Super Cool Sputtering Device). The trap column is packed with 5-μm-diameter Aqua C-18 beads (Phenomenex; www.phenomenex.com), while the analytical column is packed with 1.9 μm-diameter Reprosil-Pur C-18-AQ beads (Dr. Maisch; www.dr-maisch.com). Standard 90-min gradients were run from 10% to 32% buffer B (0.5% acetic acid and 80% acetonitrile) over 51 min, then from 32% to 40% in the next 5 min, then increased to 100% over a 2-min period, held at 100% for 2.5 min, and then dropped to 0% for another 20 min. The HPLC system included an Agilent 1290 series pump and autosampler with thermostat. The thermostat temperature was set at 6°C. The sample was loaded on the trap column at 5 μL min−1, and the analysis was performed at 0.1 μL min−1. The LTQ-Orbitrap was set to acquire a full-range scan at 60,000 resolution from 350 to 1,600 Th in the Orbitrap to simultaneously fragment the top ten peptide ions by CID and the top five peptide ions by HCD (resolution, 7,500) in each cycle in the LTQ (minimum intensity, 1,000 counts). Parent ions were then excluded from MS/MS for the next 30 s. Singly charged ions were excluded, since in electrospray ionization (ESI) mode, peptides usually carry multiple charges. The Orbitrap was continuously recalibrated using lock-mass function. For mass accuracy, the error of mass measurement is typically within 5 ppm and is not allowed to exceed 10 ppm. For quantitative analyses, Col-0 mucilage along with mum2-10 and ap2-7 seed surface extracts were prepared from 80 mg of seeds using the protocol described above for nonadherent mucilage. All protein samples were reduced/alkylated and digested as described above and then dimethylated with light, medium, and heavy formaldehyde. Col-0 samples were labeled with light formaldehyde for all replicates. mum2-10 samples were labeled with medium formaldehyde for replicates 1 and 2 and with heavy formaldehyde for replicate 3. ap2-7 samples were labeled with heavy formaldehyde for replicates 1 and 2 and with medium formaldehyde for replicate 3. Samples from all three genotypes were pooled before the MS analysis. For replicates 1 and 2, samples were analyzed using the LTQ Orbitrap Velo as described above. For replicate 3, samples were analyzed using the Impact II quadrupole-time of flight mass spectrometer (Bruker Daltonics) online coupled to an Easy nano LC 1000 HPLC device (ThermoFisher Scientific) using a captive spray nanospray ionization source (Bruker Daltonics) including a 2-cm-long 100-μm i.d. fused silica fritted trap column and a 75-μm i.d. fused silica analytical column with an integrated spray tip (6–8-μm-diameter opening pulled on a P-2000 laser puller from Sutter Instruments). The trap column is packed with 5-μm Aqua C-18 beads (Phenomenex; www.phenomenex.com), while the analytical column is packed with 1.9-μm-diameter Reprosil-Pur C-18-AQ beads (Dr. Maisch; www.dr-maisch.com). The analytical column was held at 50°C by an in-house constructed column heater. Samples were resuspended and loaded in buffer A (0.1% aqueous formic acid). Standard 45-min gradients were run from 10% to 60% buffer B (0.1% formic acid and 80% acetonitrile) over 28 min, then increased to 100% over 2 min, and held at 100% for 15 min. The liquid chromatograph thermostat temperature was set at 7°C. The sample was loaded on the trap column at 850 Bar, and the analysis was performed at a flow rate of 0.25 μL min−1. The Impact II quadrupole-time of flight mass spectrometer was set to acquire in a data-dependent auto-MS/MS mode with inactive focus fragmenting the 20 most abundant ions (one at the time at a rate of 18 Hz) after each full-range scan from m/z 200 to 2,000 Th (at a rate of 5 Hz). The isolation window for MS/MS was 2 to 3 Th depending on parent ion mass-to-charge ratio, and the collision energy ranged from 23 to 65 eV depending on ion mass and charge. Parent ions were then excluded from MS/MS for the next 0.4 min and reconsidered if their intensity increased more than 5 times. Singly charged ions were excluded, since in ESI mode, peptides usually carry multiple charges. Strict active exclusion was applied. For mass accuracy, the error of mass measurement is typically within 5 ppm and is not allowed to exceed 10 ppm. The nano ESI source was operated at 1,700 V capillary voltage, 0.20 Bar nano buster pressure, 3 L min−1 drying gas, and 150°C drying temperature. For all qualitative analyses and replicates 1 and 2 of the quantitative analyses, liquid chromatography-MS/MS data were processed with Proteome Discoverer version 1.2 (ThermoFisher Scientific) and then searched against the Uniprot-Swissprot Arabidopsis database using the MASCOT algorithm version 2.4 (CITATION; http://www.matrixscience.com). The database contains 12,069 sequences; no contaminants were added in the search space. The following parameters were applied: peptide mass accuracy, 10 ppm; fragment mass accuracy, 0.6 D; trypsin enzyme specificity, fixed modifications, carbamidomethyl, variable modifications, Met oxidation; deamidated N, Q, and N-acetyl peptides, ESI-TRAP fragment characteristics. Only those peptides with IonScores exceeding the individually calculated 99% confidence limit (as opposed to the average limit for the whole experiment) were considered as accurately identified. Proteome Discoverer parameters were as follows: event detector, mass precision of 4 ppm (corresponds to extracted ion chromatograms at ±12 ppm max error); S/N threshold, 1; quantitation method, ratio calculation; replace missing quantitation values with minimum intensity, yes; use single peak quantitation channels, yes; protein quantification, use all peptides, yes. In order for a protein to be considered a true mucilage protein in qualitative analysis, it must be identified in at least two out of the three biological replicates with MASCOT protein scores >40 (a score of ≥25 corresponds to a false discovery rate of ≤5%), and identified in at least one out of the three biological replicates with two or more unique peptides. For replicate 3 of the quantitative analysis, data analysis was performed using MaxQuant 1.5.3.30 (CITATION) with the Arabidopsis protein sequence database plus common contaminants. The search was performed using the following parameters: peptide mass accuracy, 10 ppm; fragment mass accuracy, 0.05 D; trypsin enzyme specificity, fixed modifications, carbamidomethyl, variable modifications, Met oxidation; and N-acetyl proteins. Only those peptides exceeding the individually calculated 99% confidence limit (as opposed to the average limit for the whole experiment) were considered as accurately identified. Relative protein levels from mum2-10 and ap2-7 seed surface extracts were normalized to Col-0 nonadherent mucilage. Proteins that could be detected and quantified in all three replicates were analyzed. A two-tailed Student’s t test was used to determine the statistical significance of relative protein level differences between mum2-10, ap2-7, and Col-0. RNA was extracted from various plant tissues using Trizol reagent (Life Technologies), except that siliques were processed with the RNAqueous Total RNA Isolation Kit (Ambion) while developing seed coats and embryos were processed with the RNAqueous-Micro Total RNA Isolation Kit (Ambion) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. cDNA synthesis was carried out using SuperScript II reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Quantitative PCR (qPCR) was performed using iQ SYBR Green Supermix (Bio-Rad) and the primers listed in Supplemental Table S3. The qPCRs were assayed with the iQ5 Multicolor Real-Time PCR Detection System (Bio-Rad). GAPC transcripts were used as an internal control. A two-tailed Student’s t test was used to determine the statistical significance of differences in TBA and TBAL expression levels between the amiRNA lines and the wild type. For gene expression analysis of TBAs in transcription factor mutants, RNA extraction and cDNA synthesis were performed as described previously (CITATION). PCR was performed using Mango-Taq polymerase (Bioline) and the same primers that were used for qPCR. The TBAp:GUS constructs were generated using the pBI101 vector, with the promoter fragments amplified from Col-0 genomic DNA. The TBAp:TBA-cYFP translational fusion constructs were assembled in the citrine-pCambia1300 vector as described by CITATION, with the promoter and coding region fragments amplified from Col-0 genomic DNA. The TBA amiRNA constructs were designed and built as described by CITATION using the UBQ1-pCambia1300 vector as described by CITATION. Primers used for these constructs are listed in Supplemental Table S3. The TBA and TBAL promoters were defined as the DNA sequence extending upstream of the TBA start codon to the next annotated gene, not including pseudogenes, to capture as much of the promoter region as possible without introducing another gene. TBA1p is ∼0.5 kb, TBA2p is ∼1.3 kb, TBA3p is ∼1.8 kb, and TBALp is ∼1.4 kb long. Col-0 Arabidopsis plants were transformed using the floral dip method (CITATION); at least 20 independent transgenic lines were selected for each construct. Results from at least three representative lines are shown. For seed coat mucilage staining with Ruthenium Red, ∼20 dry seeds were imbibed in 1 mL of distilled, deionized water, 0.05 m EDTA, 0.05 m CaCl2, or 0.5 m Na2CO3 for 1 h and washed twice with double-distilled water. The seeds were then stained with 0.01% (w/v) Ruthenium Red (Sigma-Aldrich) for 1 h and washed once with double-distilled water. Seeds were imaged with a DFC450 C camera (Leica) on an Axioskop 2 upright light microscope (Carl Zeiss). Histochemical GUS assays were performed essentially as described by CITATION. Tissue samples were vacuum infiltrated with GUS staining solution (0.5 mm potassium ferricyanide, 0.5 mm potassium ferrocyanide, 20 mm Na2EDTA, and 0.1% [v/v] Triton X-100, supplemented with 1 mg mL−1 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-glucuronide [Gold BioTechnology] in 100 mm phosphate buffer [pH 7]), incubated at 37°C for 16 h, and then washed several times with 75% ethanol. Tissues were imaged with a DP72 camera (Olympus) mounted on an SZX10 stereomicroscope (Olympus). All confocal images were acquired from an Ultraview VoX Spinning Disk Confocal System (PerkinElmer). For cellulose staining, seeds after mucilage extraction were stained with 0.1% (w/v) Calcofluor White for 5 min and then washed twice with double-distilled water. The seeds were inspected under UV light with the Axioskop 2 microscope. Developing siliques were ground in liquid nitrogen and added to extraction buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm PMSF, and protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche). The homogenates were centrifuged at 15,000 rpm for 10 min at 4°C, and the supernatant was collected. Protein concentrations were determined by Bradford assay (Bio-Rad), and 100-µg protein samples were electrophoretically resolved by 12% SDS-PAGE. cYFP fusion proteins were detected using a mouse anti-GFP polyclonal antibody (Roche) and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). ECL Prime western-blotting detection reagent (GE Healthcare) was used for target detection.
