!~ABS~! BINDING PROTEIN (BiP) is a major chaperone in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) lumen, and this study shows that BiP binds to the C-terminal tail of the stress sensor/transducer bZIP28, a membrane-associated transcription factor, retaining it in the ER under unstressed conditions. In response to ER stress, BiP dissociates from bZIP28, allowing it to be mobilized from the ER to the Golgi where it is proteolytically processed and released to enter the nucleus. Under unstressed conditions, BiP binds to bZIP28 as it binds to other client proteins, through its substrate binding domain. BiP dissociates from bZIP28 even when bZIP28’s exit from the ER or its release from the Golgi is blocked. Both BiP1 and BiP3 bind bZIP28, and overexpression of either BiP detains bZIP28 in the ER under stress conditions. A C-terminally truncated mutant of bZIP28 eliminating most of the lumenal domain does not bind BiP and is not retained in the ER under unstressed conditions. BiP binding sites in the C-terminal tail of bZIP28 were identified in a phage display system. BiP was found to bind to intrinsically disordered regions on bZIP28’s lumen-facing tail. Thus, the dissociation of BiP from the C-terminal tail of bZIP28 is a major switch that activates one arm of the unfolded protein response signaling pathway in plants.
!~RES~! BiP binds to bZIP28 in unstressed Arabidopsis seedlings as demonstrated by the coimmunoprecipitation of BiP with myc-bZIP28 in transgenic lines expressing myc-bZIP28 (Figure 1A). Arabidopsis encodes three BiP isoforms, BiP1 to BiP3, that are predicted to be ER lumenal proteins (see Supplemental Figure 1 online). The anti-BiP antibody used in these studies does not discriminate between the BiPs. Therefore, to determine which isoforms of BiP bind to bZIP28, we FLAG-tagged BiP1 and BiP3 and used the epitope-tagged forms in immunoprecipitation experiments with myc-bZIP28 transiently expressed in Nicotiana benthamiana leaves. BiP2 was not used in these experiments because BiP1 and BiP2 are nearly identical in sequence (see Supplemental Figure 1 online). We observed that both BiP1-flg and BiP3-flg coimmunoprecipitate with myc-bZIP28 (Figure 1B). We were also able to pull down myc-bZIP28 using BiP antibodies from unstressed Arabidopsis plants (see Supplemental Figure 2 online). These results confirmed that bZIP28 does indeed interact with BiP. [[FIGURE]] We performed further experiments to determine the characteristics of BiP binding to bZIP28. BiP appears to bind myc-bZIP28 as it does to other client proteins. BiP coimmunoprecipitated with carboxypeptidase Y star–green fluorescent protein (CPY*-GFP), a known BiP substrate (CITATION), when it was expressed from a transgene in Arabidopsis (see Supplemental Figure 3 online). Client proteins can be released from BiP by ADP/ATP exchange in BiP’s N-terminal nucleotide binding domain (CITATION). BiP was released from myc-bZIP28 upon incubation of the immunoprecipitate with ATP and MgCl2 and was not released in the absence of ATP (Figure 1C). In addition, BiP did not bind to myc-bZIP28 when BiP’s substrate binding domain was disabled by substituting Pro at position 503 for Leu. In mammalian systems, the equivalent substitution of a Pro for Leu at position 495 (BiPP495L) gives rise to a form that is defective in substrate binding (CITATION). When Arabidopsis BiP1P503L-flg was expressed along with myc-bZIP28, -BiP1P503L-flg did not coimmunoprecipitate with myc-bZIP28 (Figure 1D). Thus, we concluded that under unstressed conditions, BiP binds to bZIP28 similarly to the manner in which BiP binds to other client proteins. When seedlings are treated with ER stress agents, such as TM, bZIP28 is transported from the ER to the nucleus via the Golgi apparatus (CITATION; CITATION). We were interested in determining whether BiP dissociates from bZIP28 in response to stress and whether the dissociation of BiP is correlated with other events involved in the mobilization of bZIP28. Therefore, we performed coimmunoprecipitations of myc-bZIP28 and BiP during a time course of movement of bZIP28 from the ER to the nucleus as described by CITATION. BiP progressively dissociated from myc-bZIP28 during an hour after treating seedlings with TM (Figure 2A; see Supplemental Figure 2 online). The loss of BiP from myc-bZIP28 immunoprecipitates was due to dissociation and not to degradation of BiP because BiP levels did not decline during the time course of these experiments (see Supplemental Figure 4 online). At ∼30 min after the start of stress treatment, bZIP28 begins to exit the ER (CITATION), and by 1 h, myc-bZIP28 was being proteolytically processed (Figure 2A) and yellow fluorescent protein (YFP)-bZIP28 appeared in the nucleus (Figure 2B; see Supplemental Figure 5 online). Since BiP dissociation and YFP-bZIP28 movement occurred at about the same time, we asked whether the dissociation of BiP depends on exit of bZIP28 from the ER. To do so, we looked for the dissociation of BiP from myc-bZIP28KK320AA, a mutant that is incapable of exiting the ER. bZIP28KK320AA has an altered pair of Lys residues on the cytoplasmic side of the membrane, which impedes its interaction with COPII vesicle components and its exit from the ER (CITATION). BiP bound to myc-bZIP28KK320AA under unstressed conditions and dissociated from it following TM treatment (Figure 2C). Since it takes about an hour of TM treatment for most of BiP to dissociate from wild-type myc-bZIP28, the question can be asked whether the dissociation is only apparent because the myc-tagged N terminus of bZIP28 is cleaved off in the Golgi. To test this, we determined whether BiP dissociated from myc-bZIP28G329A, a form of bZIP28 that has a mutation in its transmembrane domain, making it resistant to proteolytic cleavage by S2P and incapable of being released from the Golgi (CITATION). BiP dissociated from myc-bZIP28G329A following TM treatment (Figure 2C). Therefore, BiP dissociates from bZIP28 in response to ER stress whether or not its exit is blocked from either the ER or Golgi. [[FIGURE]] To test whether BiP retains bZIP28 in the ER by binding to bZIP28’s C-terminal tail, two major truncation constructs were developed: YFP-bZIP28Δ591, which eliminated most of the C terminus downstream of the S1P site; and YFP-bZIP28Δ355, which removed most of bZIP28’s C-terminal tail residing in the ER lumen (Figure 3A). We tested these truncations of bZIP28 for their ability to bind BiP in stable transgenic overexpression lines. BiP bound normally to myc-bZIP28Δ591 but did not coimmunoprecipitate with myc-bZIP28Δ355, the construct lacking most of the C-terminal tail (Figure 3B). We also examined the localization and movement of YFP-tagged versions of the two truncation constructs. YFP-bZIP28Δ591 was retained in the ER under unstressed conditions and migrated to the nucleus only when seedlings were subjected to TM stress (Figures 3C and 3D). However, YFP-bZIP28Δ355 was located in the nucleus even under unstressed conditions (Figure 4A) and also under TM stressed conditions (Figure 4B). To demonstrate that YFP-bZIP28Δ355 is transcriptionally active in unstressed cells, we looked for the expression of a bZIP28 target gene, BiP3 (CITATION). We found that unstressed seedlings expressing the full-length form of YFP-bZIP28 did not upregulate BiP3, but seedlings expressing YFP-bZIP28Δ355 upregulated Bip3 expression even under unstressed conditions (see Supplemental Figure 6 online). Thus, bZIP28Δ355 does not bind to BiP and is not retained in the ER, but instead migrates to the nucleus in unstressed seedlings where it upregulates stress response genes. [[FIGURE]] [[FIGURE]] It is possible that the YFP-bZIP28Δ355 truncation construct fails to be retained in the ER by shortcutting its normal route, which involves translocation through the secretion pathway to the Golgi where it would be released by S1P and S2P proteolysis. To test whether YFP-bZIP28Δ355 follows the conventional route to the nucleus, we introduced this construct into an s2p mutant background (CITATION). Under unstressed conditions, YFP-bZIP28Δ355 was prevented from moving constitutively into the nucleus (Figures 4C and 4D). In a wild-type background and under unstressed conditions, YFP-bZIP28Δ355 was observed not only in the nucleus, but also in small punctate structures that colocalize with a Golgi body marker (see Supplemental Figure 7 online). Thus, YFP-bZIP28Δ355 moved via the Golgi to the nucleus, and this was prevented by blocking proteolysis of the bZIP28 protein in an s2p mutant. Based on the results described above in which bZIP28Δ591 bound BiP and was retained in the ER under unstressed conditions, but bZIP28Δ355 did not bind BiP and was not retained in the ER, we focused on a region (positions 376 to 555) between these sites to identify the BiP binding and ER retention domains (Figure 3A). We initially attempted to use a yeast two-hybrid system to study the interaction between BiP and bZIP28. We had to abandon this approach due to high backgrounds in controls with the lumenal domain proteins. CITATION developed a means for identifying binding sites for mammalian BiP based on a phage-panning assay for octapeptides that bind to BiP. From their findings, they generated a scoring algorithm to identify potential BiP binding sites. However, their scoring algorithm did not allow us to unambiguously identify potential BiP binding sites in the lumenal tail of bZIP28. To better identify potential BiP binding sites in bZIP28, we conducted phage panning experiments using purified, immobilized Arabidopsis BiP1-His (see Supplemental Figure 8 online) and a phage library of 12 overlapping peptides (see Supplemental Table 1 online) from the lumenal domain of bZIP28 displayed in a M13 phage display system (Figure 5A). [[FIGURE]] We subjected the overlapping peptide phage library to four rounds of panning. Among the 25 phages sequenced from the second round of panning, we recovered eight of the 12 input sequences, and the phage displaying peptide 376 led all others in frequency of recovery (Figure 5B). In the third and fourth rounds, we recovered fewer sequences, but the recovered phage were enriched further for peptides 376 and 471. Thus, in the panning assay, peptides 376 and 471 clearly outcompeted the others in binding to immobilized BiP1. The results of the panning were confirmed by scoring the binding of phage separately to immobilized BiP1 in an ELISA assay (Figure 5C). When the peptides were not challenged competitively, the difference in the binding of phage displaying peptides 376 and 471 compared with phage-displaying peptides 441 and 501 was more modest. Nonetheless, the binding of these peptides to immobilized BiP1 was comparable to the binding of phage displaying the entire region covered by the peptide library. Also, to demonstrate that the binding of the peptides to immobilized BiP is not a contextual artifact, we performed protein overlay assays. The four peptides, 376, 441, 471, and 501, were fused to a glutathione S-transferase (GST) tag in a pET42a vector and expressed in BL-21 cells. The GST-tagged peptides were pulled down using glutathione beads and loaded on SDS gels. The blots were probed with purified BiP1-His followed by primary and secondary antibodies to detect the binding of BiP1 to the individual peptides. The four GST-tagged peptides were capable of binding to BiP1 (Figure 5D). The GST control and peptides that failed to bind to immobilized BiP in the panning procedures did not show any binding in the overlay assays (see Supplemental Figure 9 online). In surveying the region covered by the phage panning analysis, it was observed that the peptides that showed the greatest binding to BiP were derived from regions of the bZIP28 lumenal tail that had the highest tendency for disorder (Figure 5A). In general, the bZIP28 C-terminal tail has three broad regions, labeled R1 to R3, that showed greater tendency for disorder. The tendency for disorder was determined by IUPred (http://iupred.enzim.hu/pred.php), a prediction program for disorder tendency based on the estimation of stabilizing contacts in the pairwise interactions between residues. Regions with fewer inter-residue interactions are predicted to be intrinsically unfolded regions (CITATION). The bZIP28 tail peptides that showed the greatest binding affinity for BiP1 were located in R1 and R2. These regions of bZIP28 showed little correlation with hydrophobicity index (see Supplemental Figure 10 online). It has been reported that BiP tends to bind to solvent-accessible hydrophobic patches on proteins (CITATION). That does not appear to be case in the binding of BiP to the lumenal tail of bZIP28. To determine if bZIP28 bearing the R1 region alone at its C-terminal tail could bind BiP, we developed another bZIP28 truncated construct, myc-bZIP28Δ450 (Figure 3A). This construct, along with BiP1-flg, was coexpressed in a tobacco leaf transient expression assay, and it was found that BiP1-flg coimmunoprecipitated with myc-bZIP28Δ450 in the leaf extracts (Figure 5E). We concluded that myc-bZIP28 bearing only the R1 region, which shows tendencies for disorder, can interact with BiP in planta. These results also demonstrated that BiP interacts independently with the different regions of the bZIP28 lumen-facing tail. We manipulated the levels of BiP expression to explore its impact on bZIP28 mobilization. Arabidopsis has three BiP genes, but since BiP1 and BiP2 are nearly identical, we overexpressed BiP1 and BiP3 with the 35S promoter in lines containing YFP-bZIP28 (see Supplemental Figure 11 online). To demonstrate that the overexpressed forms are appropriately localized at the subcellular level, we showed that BiP1-YFP-HDEL colocalized with an ER marker, sPMcherry (see Supplemental Figure 12 online). In the wild-type lines (not containing the BiP1 or BiP3 transgenes), YFP-bZIP28 was located in the ER in unstressed seedlings (Figure 6A) and translocated to nuclei after 2 h of TM treatment (Figure 6B). However, in BiP1 and BiP3 overexpressors, most YFP-bZIP28 was retained in the ER even after 2 h of TM treatment (Figures 6C and 6D). Although BiP1 and BiP3 were overexpressed, TM treatment still induced ER stress as evidenced by the splicing of bZIP60 (see Supplemental Figure 13 online and CITATION). Nonetheless, BiP1 or BiP3 overexpression interfered with the release of YFP-bZIP28 from the ER. As a control, we showed that overexpression of BiP1P503L-flg, the construct that is defective in substrate binding, did not prevent bZIP28’s movement to nuclei following stress treatment (Figure 6E). [[FIGURE]] To determine if we could further restrain the stress mobilization of YFP-bZIP28 by preventing its dissociation from BiP, we introduced into Arabidopsis mutated forms of BiP (BiPG235D) that are known in other systems to interfere with ATP binding and the release of client proteins (CITATION; CITATION). In response to TM-induced stress, the expression of BiP1G233D or BiP3G247D transgenes appeared to prevent the dissociation from myc-bZIP28 in pull-down experiments (Figure 7A). The overexpression of BiP1G233D with reduced capacity for client protein dissociation prevented the processing of myc-bZIP28 in response to DTT treatment (Figure 7B) and also effectively blocked the nuclear relocation of YFP-bZIP28 in response to TM-induced stress (Figures 7C and 7D). DTT and not TM was used as a stress agent in this experiment because TM treatment produces additional nonglycosylated forms of myc-bZIP28 that make the gel patterns difficult to interpret. In our hands, DTT has been just as effective as TM in eliciting ER stress. The overexpression BiP3G247D similarly prevented the relocation of YFP-bZIP28 to nuclei in response to TM-induced stress (Figure 7E). Thus, we conclude that overexpression of BiP, particularly forms of BiP that interfere with the release of client proteins, prevents the normal mobilization of bZIP28 from the ER to the nucleus by binding to bZIP28 and not allowing its release. [[FIGURE]] Similar experiments were conducted in BiP knockout lines containing YFP-bZIP28. Our interest here was whether the knockout of BiP genes would prevent the retention of bZIP28 in the ER under unstressed conditions. Homozygous T-DNA insertion lines are available for all three BiP genes; however, multiple mutants, such as the bip1 bip2 double mutant, are not viable. In an effort to reduce BiP levels as much as possible, we obtained lines homozygous for either bip1 or bip2 but heterozygous for the other locus as described by CITATION. The BiP3 T-DNA homozygous insertion line (GK-075D06-011890) was obtained from the Nottingham Arabidopsis Stock Centre and found not to produce BiP3 transcripts under stress conditions (see Supplemental Figure 14 online). Compared with the wild type, detectable amounts of YFP-bZIP28 escaped from the ER to nuclei under unstressed conditions in the bip1/bip1 bip2/+ and in the bip1/+ bip2/bip2 and bip3 mutant lines, indicating a reduced ability of the BiP knockout mutants to retain bZIP28 in the ER (Figures 8A to 8D). We observed processed myc-bZIP28 in the various knockout mutant lines under unstressed conditions, confirming these results and indicating that bZIP28 is constitutively activated in these lines (Figure 8E). [[FIGURE]]
!~MM~! Arabidopsis thaliana ecotype Columbia-0 was used in this study. Seeds were stratified at 4°C for 3 d prior to germination. Plants were grown under continuous white light at 23 to 25°C in soil or on Linsmaier/Skoog (LS) medium (1× LS salts, 1% Suc, and 0.8% agar). Agrobacterium tumefaciens–mediated transformation was performed using the floral dip method (CITATION). Agrobacterium strain GV3101 was used in all transformation experiments. For stress treatment, 7-d-old seedlings were treated with 2 μg mL−1 TM or 2 mM DTT in LS medium for the times indicated. For confocal microscopy, single and double transgenic plants were generated by successive floral dips of constructs. The double transgenics involving mCherry-tagged CDC markers were as follows: 35S:YFP-bZIP28 with the Golgi marker CDC-968 or with the ER marker CDC-960, and 35S:Bip1-YFP-HDEL with spMcherry, 35S:YFPΔ355 with the Golgi marker CDC-968, 35S:Bip1-flg-HDEL with myc-28, 35S:B1P3-flg-HDEL with myc-28; 35S:Bip1G233D-flg-HDEL with myc-28; 35S:Bip1-HDEL-S with YFP-bZIP28 and 35S:B1P3-HDEL-S with YFP-bZIP28. Single transgenic lines were generated for YFP-bZIP28Δ591, YFP-bZIP28Δ355, myc-bZIP28Δ591,myc-bZIP28Δ355, and CPY*-GFP. The ER marker CDC-960 and Golgi marker CDC-968 were obtained from the ABRC. T-DNA mutant line with an insertion in the first exon of BiP3 (GK-075D06-011890) was obtained from the Nottingham Arabidopsis Stock Centre (N744092). The T-DNA lines were genotyped by PCR using gene-specific primers and a left border T-DNA primer (see Supplemental Table 2 online). The insertion lines were further treated with TM for 30 min to affirm the loss of BiP3 transcripts. The bip1 and bip2 mutant lines were kindly provided by the Shuh-ichi Nishikawa Lab (Nagoya University). The lines were described by CITATION. Since the double homozygous lines are female sterile, they are maintained as bip1/+ bip2/bip2 or bip1/bip1 bip2/+ strains. The s2p mutant line was described by CITATION and was kindly provided by Ping Che (DuPont Pioneer Hi-Bred International). Plasmid constructs were prepared as summarized in Supplemental Table 3 online using the primers listed in Supplemental Table 2 online. The open reading frame of bZIP28 (At3g10800) was amplified from 1-week-old seedlings by RT-PCR using primer pair Zip28 (see Supplemental Table 2 online). The product was cloned into pSKM36 (CITATION) at the AscI and SpeI sites, resulting in pMZIP28, which was used as a template for further constructs. pMZip28 was tagged with monomeric GFP by amplifying it from a GFP vector using GFPAsc primers and inserting it into the AscI site to generate N-terminal monomeric GFP–tagged bZIP28. A 4× epitope myc tag (EQKLISEEDLRN) was amplified from pSKM36 using the primer MycAsc (including the ATG before the myc sequence) and inserted into pMZIP28 at the AscI site to generate N-terminal myc-tagged bZIP28. The construction of bZIP28KK311AA, bZIP28KK320AA, and bZIPG329A mutants has been described previously by CITATION. The vectors pSKM36 and pSKY are described by CITATION. The open reading frames of BiP1 and BiP3 were amplified from 10-d-old seedlings (for Bip3; cDNAs were generated from the RNA of seedlings treated for 30 min with TM) using the primers Bip1SKHDELStopPr and Bip3HDELStopPr listed in Supplemental Table 2 online. The templates were called Bip1SKHDELStop and Bip3HDELStop. The Flag and YFP tags with HDEL sequences (as required) were attached to the C terminus of BiP1 and BiP3 using the enzyme SpeI. The BiP1G233D and BiP3G247D mutations were prepared by overlapping PCR using the primers listed and the templates Bip1SKHDELStop and Bip3HDELStop. The signal peptide chitinase mCherry marker was prepared by amplifying the CSP-YFP-HDEL obtained from Edgar Cahoon (University of Nebraska) (CITATION) using the primers spMcherry and ligated into the vector pCHF1 with HDEL sequence at its C terminus to retain the protein in the ER. Cloning of the peptides from the C terminus of bZIP28 was performed in pCANTB SE at the SfiI and NotI sites using pMZIP28 as template and the primers are listed in Supplemental Table 2 online. bZIP28 was cloned in pET28 at the BamHI and NotI sites and expressed in BL-21 cells. Transient expression in tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) leaf epidermis was performed as described previously (CITATION) using Agrobacterium (OD600 = 0.05) containing the binary vectors pSKY and pSKM36. To prepare plant extracts for immunoprecipitations of myc-tagged proteins, 5 g of seedlings was ground in liquid nitrogen and suspended in 25 mM Tris/HCl, pH 7.2, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40 (Calbiochem), and 10% glycerol. Anti-c-myc agarose conjugate (Sigma-Aldrich) was added to the filtered lysate and incubated for 2 h at 4°C. The mixture was rotated at 4°C for 2 h, and beads were washed four times for 5 min each with the buffer described above. The recovered beads were resuspended and boiled in 2× SDS buffer for 5 min, and the eluted material was subjected to immunoblotting. Plant crude extracts (input material for the immunoprecipitation reactions) were analyzed for the presence of the tagged protein using c-myc antibody (9E10; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) as probe. BiP-bound proteins were immunoprecipitated from 2 g of plant material using a BiP antibody, ADI-SPA-818 D from Enzo Life Sciences. The mixture was rotated at 4°C for 2 h. This was followed by binding to protein agarose 916-157 (Millipore), and bound beads were washed four times for 5 min each with the buffer described above followed by loading on SDS gel. Flag antibodies (F1804; Sigma-Aldrich) and GFP antibodies (11814460001; Roche) were used in immunoprecipitations and in probing immunoblots. Immunoblots were performed as described by CITATION, CITATION). To examine the processing of bZIP28, plants were grown vertically on Petri plates containing agar medium. Ten-day-old seedlings were treated with 2 mm DTT in LS medium, and 300 mg of root material was harvested from the treated plants. Roots were homogenized in liquid nitrogen, and 30 μg of protein was loaded per lane on gels. T8203 monoclonal anti-αtubulin antibody from Sigma-Aldrich was used to detect tubulin as a loading control. Subcellular localization and protein movement experiments for fluorescent-tagged proteins were performed using a NikonC1si confocal scanning system attached to a 90i microscope (Nikon Instruments). Roots were used for microscopy from plants pretreated with TM, and untreated plants were used as controls. The roots were observed under ×20 and ×60 water lenses. Some roots were counterstained with 50 mg mL−1 propidium iodide and Syto Red. The emission signals for YFP, propidium iodide, and SYTO Red 59 were acquired using sequential scanning mode to eliminate crosstalk and emission signal bleed-through. Fluorescence emission was obtained by laser excitation of YFP at 488 nm, and for mCherry, propidium iodide, or Syto Red, excitation was at 591 nm. Emission was in the range 500 to 575 and 590 to 700 nm, respectively. Syto Red 59 (S-11341) was obtained from Molecular Probes. Total RNA was isolated from ground plant tissues using an RNeasy kit, treated with RNase-free DNase I, according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Qiagen), and was quantified by 260/280-nm UV light absorption. A 1-μg portion of total RNA was reverse transcribed using the Supertranscript III RT kit (Invitrogen). A 2-μL volume of cDNA was used for RT-PCR. All primers are listed in Supplemental Table 2 online. Twelve overlapping regions of the lumenal domain of bZIP28 were generated by PCR using bZIP28 cDNA as a template and forward and reverse primers to incorporate SfiI and NotI sites. The PCR fragments were then digested with SfiI and NotI, ligated into a similarly digested pCANTAB 5E phagemid vector, and subsequently transformed into Escherichia coli XL1-Blue cells (Stratagene). Single colonies from each plate were inoculated into 5 mL 2YT/carbenicillin/tetracycline media, grown to OD600 of ∼0.2 to 0.3 at 37°C and then infected with helper phage-VCSM13 (Stratagene). After 1 h, the cell culture was transferred to 25 mL 2YT/Kan media and further incubated overnight at 37°C. After removing cell debris by centrifugation, phage particles were precipitated from the supernatant using 7.5 mL 20% polyethylene glycol solution containing 2.5 M NaCl. The precipitate was resuspended in 1 mL PBS, and the phage concentration was determined by measuring absorbance at 268 λ (OD268 = 1.0 for a solution containing 5 × 1012 phage per mL). A peptide library was prepared by mixing equal concentrations of individual phage peptide. BiP1 was His tagged at its N terminus in the pET28a vector. The construct was introduced into E. coli strain BL21, and cells were induced with 300 μM isopropyl β-D-1 thiogalacopyranodise overnight at 16°C. His-tagged BiP1 was purified using nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid agarose beads (Qiagen). The incubation buffer contained 50 mM sodium phosphate buffer, pH 8.0, 300 mM NaCl, 20 mM imidazole, and 0.05% Tween. The mixture was rotated at 4°C for 2 h and washed four times with incubation buffer. The protein was eluted by increasing the imidazole concentration in the incubation buffer to 250 mM. The beads were resuspended and boiled in 2× SDS buffer for 5 min and subjected to SDS-PAGE to check for purity. The purified BiP-His was used for panning experiments, ELISA, and overlay immunoblotting. His-tagged BiP1 protein was immobilized in the wells of a Nunc Maxisorp ELISA plate by aliquoting 100 μL of protein at a concentration of 10 µg/mL in 50 mM NaHCO3, pH 9.6, at room temperature with gentle rotation for 2 h. Wells were then blocked with PBS containing 0.2% BSA for 1 h followed by three washings with PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 (PBST) and then incubated with 100 μL of the phage peptide library from the lumenal domain of bZIP28 for 3 h at room temperature with gentle rotation. After removing unbound phage by washing with PBST five times, bound phage was eluted by incubating with 500 μL of 0.1 M HCl for 5 min at room temperature with shaking. The eluted phage were immediately neutralized by the addition of one-third phage volume of 1 M Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0, followed by infection of XL1-Blue cells (grown to <0.6 OD) with the phage. Infected XL1-Blue cells were incubated at 37°C for 20 min followed by addition of the helper phage (VCSM13) and again incubating at 37°C for 30 min. The phage-infected XL1-Blue cells were transferred into a conical flask containing 50 mL of 2YT medium containing 10 µg/mL of tetracycline and 100 µg/mL of ampicillin that was further incubated at 37°C overnight with shaking at 210 rpm. Phage was prepared as described earlier, yielding the first round of enriched phage. The entire process was repeated for four rounds, and after two, three, and four rounds, phage-infected XL1-Blue cells were grown on 2YT ampicillin plates. Plasmids were prepared from 25 randomly selected colonies and their DNA sequenced. For phage ELISAs, 100 μL of His-tagged BiP1 protein and BSA (control) (10 µg/mL in 50 mM NaHCO3, pH 9.6) were immobilized in the wells of an ELISA plate at room temperature with gentle rotation for 2 h. The plate was then washed two times with PBS followed by blocking with PBST containing 0.2% BSA for 1 h. Subsequently, after three washings with PBST, wells were incubated with the 100 μL of phage displaying lumenal domain peptides diluted in PBST containing 0.2% BSA for 2 h at room temperature with gentle shaking. The plate was again washed three times with PBST followed by incubation with anti-M13 HRP conjugated antibody for 1 h. After washing four more times with PBST, bound phage in each well was detected by incubating for ∼10 min with 50 μL of a solution containing 0.01% hydrogen peroxide and 0.8 mg/mL o-phenylenediamine dihydrochoride. Reactions were terminated by the addition of 50 μL 3M HCl, and absorbance of the developed yellow color was measured at 490 nm. The four peptides (441, 471, 376, and 501) were tagged on their N terminus with a GST tag in pET42a vector. For in vitro GST pull-down assays, GST-441, GST-471, GST-376, GST-501, and GST-H6 (control) were bound to glutathione agarose beads (Sigma-Aldrich). The pull-down mixture contained 25 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 75 mM NaCl, 0.5 mM EDTA, 0.5 mM DTT, 0.05% Nonidet P-40, and 1 mg/mL BSA (NEB). The mixture was rotated at 4°C for 2 h and washed four times with pull-down buffer. The beads were resuspended and boiled in 2× SDS buffer for 5 min, and the eluted material was subjected to SDS-PAGE. GST-tagged peptides were transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane after separation on SDS-PAGE, and the membrane was blocked with 1% BSA in TBS buffer. Ten micrograms of BiP protein was allowed to bind to the respective peptides by incubation in T-TBS buffer containing 0.1% BSA. This was followed by incubation of the blot with the BiP antibody, which was detected by a secondary antibody, as described in the immunoblotting procedure. Sequence data from this article can be found in the Arabidopsis Genome Initiative or GenBank/EMBL databases under the following accession numbers: BiP1 (At5g28540), BiP2 (At5g42020), BiP3 (At1g09080), bZIP17 (At2g40950), bZIP28 (At3g10800), Erdj3a (At3g08970), Erdj3b (At3g62600), and S2P (At4g20310).
