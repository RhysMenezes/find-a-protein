!~ABS~! Chloroplasts and mitochondria contain a family of putative preprotein and amino acid transporters designated PRAT. Here, we analyzed the role of two previously characterized PRAT protein family members, encoded by At3g49560 (HP30) and At5g24650 (HP30‐2), in planta using a combination of genetic, cell biological and biochemical approaches. Expression studies and green fluorescent protein tagging identified HP30‐2 both in chloroplasts and mitochondria, whereas HP30 was located exclusively in chloroplasts. Biochemical evidence was obtained for an association of mitochondrial HP30‐2 with two distinct protein complexes, one containing the inner membrane translocase TIM22 and the other containing an alternative NAD(P)H dehydrogenase subunit (NDC1) implicated in a respiratory complex 1‐like electron transport chain. Through its association with TIM22, HP30‐2 is involved in the uptake of carrier proteins and other, hydrophobic membrane proteins lacking cleavable NH2‐terminal presequences, whereas HP30‐2's interaction with NDC1 may permit controlling mitochondrial biogenesis and activity. 
!~RES~! Specific antisera were raised against HP30 and HP30‐2 for localization and expression studies. For comparison, antibodies were raised against HP20 and HP22 (see Figures S1–S4 for details on the production and characterization of these different antibodies). The final antisera obtained were used to probe protein gel blots separating total leaf as well as chloroplast and mitochondrial extracts. Figure 1A shows that HP30 and HP30‐2 were barely detectable in leaf extracts. Consistent with previous results (Rossig et al. CITATION) and database analyses performed at the Bio‐Array Resource (BAR) platform of the University of Toronto (Winter et al. CITATION), HP30 and HP30‐2 were found in chloroplasts (Figure 1A). Similar results were obtained for HP20 and HP22 (Figure S5). For HP30‐2 and HP22, signals were also obtained in mitochondrial protein extracts from 4 weeks old Arabidopsis plants. Time course experiments illustrated a negative light regulation of HP20 and HP30 expression in 4.5 d old, etiolated plants during greening (Figures 1B, S5). By contrast, HP30‐2 and HP22 were constitutively expressed (Figures 1B, S5). Respective control analyses demonstrated the differential regulation of NADPH:protochlorophyllide oxidoreductase (POR), the major light harvesting chlorophyll a/b‐binding protein of photosystem II (LHCII) and the β‐subunit of the CF0/CF1‐ATPase during greening (Figure S6A).  [[FIGURE]] Using bacterially expressed, 35S‐methione‐labeled HP20, HP22, HP30 and HP30‐2 proteins, in vitro import assays were conducted with isolated Arabidopsis chloroplasts and isolated Arabidopsis mitochondria. In a first set of experiments, 35S‐labeled HP30 and HP30‐2 were incubated with chloroplasts that had been isolated by Percoll/sucrose density centrifugation from light‐grown Arabidopsis plants. After various periods, chloroplasts were collected by centrifugation and re‐purified before being treated with thermolysin, a protease frequently used to degrade unimported proteins adhering to the outer plastid envelope during plastid re‐isolation (Cline et al. CITATION; Rossig et al. CITATION). When import was analyzed, HP30 and HP30‐2 were found to attain thermolysin‐protected conformations (Figure 1C) suggestive of conformational changes to occur upon binding to the plastid envelope or import to proceed across the envelope membranes during incubation. Controls with the small subunit precursor of ribulose‐1,5‐bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase confirmed that the uptake assays were productive (Figure S7A). Additional controls revealed that 35S‐HP30 and 35S‐HP30‐2 were per se sensitive to thermolysin and degraded when incubated in the absence of chloroplasts (Figure 1D). 35S‐HP30 and 35S‐HP30‐2 behaved as integral membrane proteins of the inner plastid envelope membranes, as demonstrated by fractionation and salt extraction experiments with 1 mol/L NaCl and 0.1 mol/L Na2CO3, pH 11 (Figure 1E, F; cf. Figure S6B for respective marker proteins). After both treatments, 35S‐HP30 and 35S‐HP30‐2 were present in the membrane pellets, but not corresponding supernatants, obtained after centrifugation of the incubation mixtures (Figure 1E, F). Fractionation and protease protection assays carried out for the endogenous HP30‐2 confirmed the localization and topology of HP30‐2 in the mitochondrial inner membrane (Figure S8). Transgenic expression in Arabidopsis plants confirmed the chloroplast localization of HP30‐GFP fusion protein (Figures S9–S11). By analogy, HP20‐GFP studied in parallel was located in chloroplasts but not in mitochondria (Figures S9–S11). Unlike HP20 and HP30, 35S‐HP22 and 35S‐HP30‐2 were targeted to isolated mitochondria in vitro and attained proteinase K‐resistant conformations (Figures 1C, S5C). Mitochondrial uptake assays with the precursors of the alternative oxidase (pAOX) and the inner membrane carrier protein adenine nucleotide translocator (ANT) proved the functionality of the import assays (Figure S7B, C). Incubations carried out in the absence of mitochondria showed that 35S‐HP22 and 35S‐HP30‐2 were not intrinsically resistant to proteinase K (Figures 1D, S5D).  In more refined experiments, the sublocalization of HP30‐2 in mitochondria was examined. Incubations were performed in the absence or presence of valinomycin to dissipate the membrane potential ΔΨ. Data in Figure 1G demonstrate the formation of proteinase K‐resistant 35S‐HP30‐2 in mitochondria irrespective of the presence of valinomycin. By contrast, HP30 did not produce protease‐resistant bands and was degraded by proteinase K (Figure 1G). Rupture of the outer mitochondrial membrane following import but prior to protease digestion, resulted in a protease‐protected fragment of 35S‐HP30‐2 (Figure 1H, panel a). The appearance of this fragment was reminiscent of that routinely obtained for the inner mitochondrial membrane protein TIM23‐2 that is broken down up to its membrane portion by protease (Murcha et al. CITATION) (Figure 1H, panel b). Addition of valinomycin dissipating the ΔΨ, followed by rupture of the outer mitochondrial membrane, resulted in the degradation of imported 35S‐HP30‐2 and 35S‐TIM23‐2 by added proteinase K (Figure 1H), a result consistent with what is expected for an integral inner membrane protein that could not reach its final destination and accumulated in the intermembrane space. When rabbit reticulocyte‐translated 35S‐HP30‐2 was used in parallel experiments, several bands were obtained (Figure S12) presumably resulting from internal translation initiation at subsequent in‐frame methionine codons or partial proteolysis of the newly produced main proteins (Murcha et al. CITATION). Importantly, the two uppermost bands bound mitochondria and were imported into the inner membrane (Figure S12). On the basis of these data we concluded that 35S‐HP30‐2 is an integral inner mitochondrial membrane protein.  The localization and function of HP30‐2 in mitochondria were examined further in subsequent experiments. HP30‐2 was expressed as COOH‐terminally, hexa‐histidine‐tagged protein (HP30‐2‐(His)6) in Escherichia coli and purified (Rossig et al. CITATION) and used for in vitro uptake experiments with mitochondria that had been isolated from 14 d old, light‐grown Arabidopsis plants. After different incubations under standard import conditions (see SI section), complexes formed with HP30‐2‐(His)6 were isolated by Ni‐NTA agarose chromatography from ruptured mitochondria, eluted and analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS‐PAGE).  The protein pattern consisted of HP30‐2‐(His)6 and six main polypeptide groups (Figure 2A). Protein sequencing identified the new bands to represent TIM22 (encoded by At3g10110 or At1g18320) (Carrie et al. CITATION), the mitochondrial intermembrane space import and assembly protein MIA40 (encoded by At5g23395) (Carrie et al. CITATION; Riemer et al. CITATION), three proteins dubbed tiny TIMs (TIM8, encoded by At5g50810; TIM9, encoded by At3g46560; and TIM10, encoded by At2g29530) implicated in the mitochondrial import of carrier proteins and β‐barrel proteins (Carrie et al. CITATION; Riemer et al. CITATION), the outer mitochondrial membrane receptor OM64 (encoded by At5g09420) (Chew et al. CITATION; Qbadou et al. CITATION), the C1 subunit of the alternative NAD(P)H dehydrogenase (NDC1, encoded by At5g08740) (Carrie et al. CITATION; Piller et al. CITATION), and mitochondrial import motor protein HSP70 (mtHSP70; encoded by At4g37910 and At5g09590) (Sung et al. CITATION; Sarkar et al. CITATION). TIM8, TIM9 and TIM10 were not well resolved under the electrophoresis conditions used here and migrated as a single band of ≈10 kDa. For MIA40, two bands were seen of which the upper most likely represents a covalent adduct comprising MIA40 and HP30‐2 held together by a mixed disulfide bond. As shown previously, HP30‐2 easily forms such intermediates (Rossig et al. CITATION).  [[FIGURE]] The simultaneous presence of TIM22 and NDC1 in the protein pattern obtained with HP30‐2‐(His)6 (Figure 2A) suggested that there might be different protein complexes in the inner mitochondrial membrane containing HP30‐2. When the protein mixture eluted from the Ni‐NTA column was subjected to non‐denaturing PAGE, indeed one main band and several other bands were obtained (Figure 2B, panel b). Western blotting showed that at least three of these bands contained HP30‐2 (Figure 2B, panel c); the other bands may represent assembly intermediates of HP30‐2 or contaminations. One of the specific bands, designated HP30‐2A, also contained TIM22 (Figure 2B, panel d) and thus appears to represent a complex involved in the uptake of cytosolic precursor proteins into the inner mitochondrial membrane. In gel filtration assays, HP30‐2A eluted at an apparent molecular mass of ≈780 kDa. The second band, designated HP30‐2B, eluted at ≈240 kDa, and the third band eluted at ≈90 kDa (Figure 2C). The latter band likely represents unassembled HP30‐2 trapped in detergent micelles (Berthold et al. CITATION). The elution profile of the two main bands was indistinguishable from that of the native HP30‐2 (Figure 2D). Thus, with a very good likelihood, the complexes formed with HP30‐2‐(His)6 in vitro were reflecting those established with the endogenous HP30‐2 in vivo.  We next imported TIM22‐(His)6 and NDC1‐(His)6 into mitochondria and purified by affinity‐chromatography on Ni‐NTA agarose protein complexes from detergent‐solubilized total mitochondrial membrane. After non‐denaturing PAGE, TIM22‐(His)6 gave rise to a complex that corresponded to complex HP30‐2A seen before, whereas NDC1‐(His)6 gave rise to a main complex that corresponded to complex HP30‐2B (Figure 3A, panels a and b). Both complexes contained HP30‐2, as demonstrated by Western blotting (Figure 3A, panels a and b (α‐HP30‐2)). Western blotting with NDC1‐specific antibodies identified two additional NDC1 bands the identity of which was not analyzed further (Figure 3A, panel c (α‐NDC1)). When the isolated HP30‐2 complexes were analyzed by SDS‐PAGE, two protein patterns were obtained that were fundamentally different for complex HP30‐2A and complex HP30‐2B. While complex HP30‐2A contained TIM22, HP30‐2, MIA40, OM64 and mtHSP70 as well as some other proteins (Figure 3B, lane 1), complex HP30‐2B contained HP30‐2, MIA40, mtHSP70 and NDC1 as well as a few minor bands (Figure 3B, lane 2). Results shown in Figure S13 underscored the identity of protein‐protein interactions established by HP30‐2 in vitro and in vivo. Collectively, these data resolved the results shown in Figure 2 in terms of the presence of two structurally and functionally different complexes in mitochondria in which HP30‐2 is involved. Complex HP30‐2A very likely plays a role in the import of proteins containing hydrophobic membrane spans including carrier proteins and does so by the combined action of TIM22 and HP30‐2 that both are PRAT proteins and contain conserved sterile alpha motives (SAMs) operating as protein interaction domains (Schultz et al. CITATION; Meruelo and Bowie CITATION). Import through the HP30‐2::TIM22 complex is coupled to the import motor and folding machineries operating in the matrix (mtHSP70) as well as intermembrane space (MIA40). Complex HP30‐2B also contains HP30‐2, mtHSP70 and MIA40 but lacks TIM22 and instead contains NDC1. This suggests complex HP30‐2B to couple alternative, NDC1‐mediated electron transport to (i) normal, mtHSP70‐mediated and (ii) oxidative, MIA40‐driven protein folding.  [[FIGURE]] The roles of HP30 and HP30‐2 were followed up by RNA interference, using previously established lines (Rossig et al. CITATION; cf. Figure S14). Consistent with previous results (Rossig et al. CITATION), none of the RNAi plants had a visible phenotype if grown under continuous white light illumination. However, when cultivated under 16 h white light 8 h dark cycles, plant growth was retarded and, depending on the light intensity used, gave rise to a chlorotic phenotype similar to that described by Murcha et al. (CITATION) for tric1::tric2 (hp30::hp30‐2) double mutants. Strikingly, etiolated RNAi plants were conditionally seedling‐lethal and died when illuminated (Figures 4A, S15). Terminal deoxyribonucleotidyl transferase‐mediated dUTP‐fluorescein nick end‐labelling (TUNEL) measurements and DNA fragmentation analyses by conventional agarose gel electrophoresis (Gavrieli et al. CITATION; Lin et al. CITATION) revealed mass DNA breakdown to occur in illuminated RNAi#2 versus wild‐type seedlings (Figure 4B, C).  [[FIGURE]] If HP30‐2 would cooperate with TIM22 in the import of transit sequence‐less mitochondrial proteins, lack of HP30‐2 should lead to reductions or depletions in the inner mitochondrial membrane protein pattern. To avoid any phototoxic effects associated with greening, mitochondria were isolated from 4.5 d old dark‐grown plants. Then, inner mitochondrial membrane proteins were prepared and their proteins analyzed by SDS‐PAGE. Figure 5A shows that the patterns of mitochondrial inner membrane proteins were distinct for wild‐type and RNAi#2 seedlings. The patterns differed by the abundance of several higher and lower molecular mass proteins. Protein sequencing (Figure 5A) and protein gel blot analyses (Figure S16) revealed that while TIM22 was reduced in amount, NDC1 was entirely absent from the inner mitochondrial membrane of RNAi#2 plants. For TIM23 and TIM17‐2, elevated protein levels were seen, as compared to those in the wild‐type (Figure 5A; see also Figure S16). In vitro uptake assays revealed that 35S‐HP30‐2, while yet imported, could not assemble further with other components of the inner mitochondrial membrane in RNAi#2 plants and thus did not form higher molecular mass complexes as those in wild‐type plants (Figure 5B). A possible explanation could be that, because of the reduced amount or even complete lack of respective partner proteins, including TIM22 and NDC1, HP30‐2 lacked ability to establish larger complexes. It is attractive to hypothesize that the observed up‐regulation of TIM17‐2 and TIM23 expression, as seen at the RNA and protein levels (cf. Figures 5A, C, S16), could be a mechanism to account for the increased import needs of RNAi#2 plants for transit sequence‐less proteins, including HP30‐2.  [[FIGURE]] To test this hypothesis, 35S‐HP30‐2 was imported into isolated wild‐type and RNAi#2 mitochondria. Incubations were carried out in the absence or presence of valinomycin to dissipate the membrane potential ΔΨ. Data in Figure 5D demonstrated the faithful uptake of 35S‐HP30‐2 into wild‐type mitochondria, as concluded from the appearance of proteinase K‐resistant 35S‐HP30‐2 band. Rupture of the outer mitochondrial membrane following import but prior to protease digestion, resulted in the major protease‐protected fragment of 35S‐HP30‐2 seen before (Figure 1G; referred to as trans‐membrane domain (TMD) 1 in Figure 5D). A second, smaller and much less abundant fragment of 35S‐HP30‐2 was observed (TMD2 in Figure 5D). When import was analyzed for RNAi#2 mitochondria, only this minor, lower molecular mass fragment of 35S‐HP30‐2 (TMD2) appeared. Interestingly, this band already was present in assays to which proteinase K had not been added yet, suggesting a topology different from that of 35S‐HP30‐2 generating the main proteinase K‐resistant main band (TMD1). Because the appearance of TMD2 of HP30‐2 was sensitive to valinomycin, we concluded that it represents a default product incapable of giving rise to functional HP30‐2 complexes. Control uptake assays showed a lack of import of other transit sequence‐less proteins, such as the oxaloacetate malate translocator (OMT) and TIM22, into RNAi#2 mitochondria (Figure S17). Together, these data identified HP30‐2 and TIM22 as essential components of a new pathway of import of transit sequence‐less precursors into mitochondria of Arabidopsis. 
!~MM~! All knock‐out mutant and RNAi lines used in this study have been described elsewhere (Rossig et al. CITATION). Further details can be found in the SI section. Plants were grown at 23°C under long‐day conditions (16 h at 120 µE/m2/s light, 8 h dark), except for RNAi plants that were cultivated under continuous white light illumination provided by fluorescence bulbs. For illumination experiments, seeds were surface‐sterilized with 70% (v/v) ethanol/0.1% (v/v) Tween 20 and germinated on sucrose‐free, half‐strength Murashige‐Skoog (MS) agar medium for 4.5 d before being exposed to white light of either 120 μE/m2/s or ≈210 μE/m2/s (Samol et al. CITATION).  Conditions for the isolation of chloroplasts and mitochondria, in organello‐protein synthesis and protein uptake have been described (Pollmann et al. CITATION; Rossig et al. CITATION) and are summarized in detail in the SI section.  Carboxy‐terminally, hexa‐histidine (His)6‐tagged, 35S‐methionine‐labelled HP30‐2, TIM22 and NDC1 were produced in E. coli strain SG13009 (Qiagen), purified by Ni‐NTA agarose chromatography and used for isolating protein complexes from detergent‐solubilized mitochondria (Berthold et al. CITATION). Briefly, intact mitochondria were recovered after the import reaction by centrifugation and suspended in a buffer containing 20 mmol/L HEPES‐KOH, 0.6 mol/L sorbitol (pH 7.2), at a protein concentration of 10 mg/mL. Mitochondria (1 mg of protein) then were solubilized with 1% (v/v) or 3.5% (v/v) digitonin in solubilization buffer containing 30 mmol/L HEPES‐KOH, 200 mmol/L K‐acetate, 1 mmol/L ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, and 1 mmol/L ethyleneglycoltetraacetic acid (pH 7.4) and subjected to a centrifugation step at 109 000 × g in a Beckman TL100 ultracentrifuge, TLA45 rotor, for 30 min. Gel filtration was carried out on a Superose 12 gel filtration column (25 mL column volume; Pharmacia) at a flow rate of 0.3 mL/min in column buffer containing 1% (v/v) digitonin or 2% (v/v) octylglucoside (Berthold et al. CITATION). Protein was separated by either non‐denaturing or denaturing PAGE (Laemmli CITATION) and detected by Coomassie staining, autoradiography or Western blotting with specific antibodies.  Testing of seedling viability was carried out with tetrazolium (Nortin CITATION), using 4.5 d old etiolated seedlings that had been transferred to white light of 120 μE/m2/s or ≈210 μE/m2/s (Samol et al. CITATION).  DNA breakage indicative of apoptotic cell death in irradiated RNAi seedlings was monitored by agarose gel electrophoresis and ethidium bromide staining or deoxynucleotidyl transferase‐mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) measurements using ApopTag Fluorescein In Situ Apoptosis Detection Kit (Intergen Company, Purchase, NY, USA) (Gavrieli et al. CITATION; Lin et al. CITATION). Briefly, etiolated seedlings were infiltrated in the dark with equilibration buffer containing TdT enzyme and incubated at 25°C for 2 h before being exposed to white light for appropriate periods. Seedlings were briefly washed with equilibration buffer and incubated for 30 min in the dark with fluorescein‐conjugated anti‐digoxigenin. After another washing step, specimens were inspected under a fluorescent microscope.
