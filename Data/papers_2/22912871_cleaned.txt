!~ABS~! The expression of auxin-responsive genes is regulated by the TIR1/AFB auxin receptor-dependent degradation of Aux/IAA transcriptional repressors, which interact with auxin-responsive factors (ARFs). Most of the 29 Aux/IAA genes present in Arabidopsis have not been functionally characterized to date. IAA8 appears to have a distinct function from the other Aux/IAA genes, due to its unique transcriptional response to auxin and the stability of its encoded protein. In this study, we characterized the function of Arabidopsis IAA8 in various developmental processes governed by auxin and in the transcriptional regulation of the auxin response. Transgenic plants expressing estrogen-inducible IAA8 (XVE::IAA8) exhibited significantly fewer lateral roots than the wild type, and an IAA8 loss-of-function mutant exhibited significantly more. Ectopic overexpression of IAA8 resulted in abnormal gravitropism. The strong induction of early auxin-responsive marker genes by auxin treatment was delayed by IAA8 overexpression. GFP-fusion analysis revealed that IAA8 localized not only to the nucleus, but, in contrast to other Aux/IAAs, also to the cytosol. Furthermore, we demonstrated that IAA8 interacts with TIR1, in an auxin-dependent fashion, and with ARF proteins, both in yeast and in planta. Taken together, our results show that IAA8 is involved in lateral root formation, and that this process is regulated through the interaction with the TIR1 auxin receptor and ARF transcription factors in the nucleus.
!~RES~! To characterize the function of IAA8 in Arabidopsis, we generated transgenic plants that overexpress IAA8. Initially, we used the Cauliflower Mosaic Virus (CaMV) 35S promoter for the overexpression; however, strong overexpression of IAA8 in any transgenic plants could not be confirmed (data not shown). Therefore, the estradiol-inducible promoter XVE in the pER8 vector [pone.0043414-Zuo1] was used to create transgenic plants that conditionally and strongly express IAA8 (XVE::IAA8). The expression of XVE::IAA8 transgenes upon induction with estradiol was examined in over 20 transgenic lines by semi-quantitative reverse transcriptase-PCR (RT-PCR) analysis. Of XVE::IAA8 plants examined, IAA8 expression was induced above endogenous levels only in lines #8 and #11 following estradiol treatment ([pone-0043414-g001], data not shown). Wild-type (Col-0) and XVE::IAA8 (line #8, #11) roots treated first with 10 μM β-estradiol for 24 h and then with 1 μM IAA for 0 to 60 min were subjected to semi-quantitative RT-PCR analysis of the auxin marker genes, IAA1, IAA19 and GH3.3 together with endogenous IAA8 gene expression (end) and of both endogenous and exogenous (end + exo) IAA8 gene expression. EF1α was used as an internal control. All semi-quantitative RT-PCR figures are representative of three biological replicates. These XVE::IAA8 plants were used for further experiments together with a loss-of-function T-DNA insertion mutant of IAA8, iaa8-1[pone.0043414-Overvoorde1]. The aerial parts of iaa8-1 and XVE::IAA8 plants did not show any obvious phenotypic change compared with those of wild-type Col-0 plants (data not shown). The absence of visible developmental defects in a loss-of-function mutant of IAA8 is consistent with findings of a previous report [pone.0043414-Overvoorde1]. Since several Aux/IAA genes are involved in auxin-related root development, such as primary root elongation, lateral root formation, and grapitropism [pone.0043414-Rouse1], [pone.0043414-Tian1], [pone.0043414-Nagpal1]–[pone.0043414-Uehara1], [pone.0043414-Park1], we decided to examine these auxin-related root phenotypes in iaa8-1 and XVE::IAA8 plants. On normal MS medium, the phenotype of all of the genotypes examined was unaffected ([pone-0043414-g002], left; data not shown). Following estradiol treatment, the roots exhibited growth defects, even in Col-0 seedlings ([pone-0043414-g002], right). The seedlings of both XVE::IAA8 lines treated with estradiol exhibited abnormal gravitropism and had more severe root growth defects than estradiol-treated Col-0 plants ([pone-0043414-g002], right). However, there was not a statistically significant difference in primary root growth between Col-0 and any of the genotypes treated with estradiol (Figure S1). In contrast, the number of lateral roots in both iaa8-1 and one of estradiol-treated XVE::IAA8 plants (line #11) was altered ([pone-0043414-g002]). A significant increase in the number of lateral roots was observed in iaa8-1 as compared with Col-0 ([pone-0043414-g002], Figure S2), whereas the number of lateral roots in one of estradiol-treated XVE::IAA8 plants (line #11), which displayed a strong abnormal root phenotype ([pone-0043414-g002], right), was reduced ([pone-0043414-g002]). In addition, the gravitropic response of estradiol-treated XVE::IAA8 plants was also diminished, whereas that of iaa8-1 was unaltered as compared with Col-0 ([pone-0043414-g002]). (A) Effects of estradiol treatment on the phenotype of wild-type (Col-0) and XVE::IAA8 (line #8 and #11) seedlings. All seedlings were vertically grown for 14 days on 1/2 MS medium containing 10 μM β-estradiol (+β-estradiol) or 0.1% ethanol (−β-estradiol). Bar = 1 cm. (B) The number of lateral roots was counted on Col-0, XVE::IAA8, and iaa8-1 seedlings grown for 14 days on 1/2 MS medium containing 10 μM β-estradiol (+β-estradiol) or 0.1% ethanol (−β-estradiol). Averages of at least 20 seedlings ± S.D. are shown. A statistical analysis was performed using Student's t test, with significant differences indicated relative to Col-0 (* P<0.05, ** P<0.01). (C) Gravitropic response of Col-0, XVE::IAA8, and iaa8-1 seedling roots. Seedlings were grown vertically for 5 days on 1/2 MS medium containing 10 μM β-estradiol, and then reoriented by 90° and grown for 4 days on the same medium. The deviation from a vertical line observed in the primary root growth was measured and assigned to one of twelve 30° sectors in the circular histograms. The length of each bar represents the percentage of seedlings showing the same direction of root growth. Over 30 seedlings were evaluated for each genotype. Aux/IAA proteins possess a potent transcriptional co-repression activity through their domain I, which contains an EAR-motif for interaction with the co-repressor protein TPL [pone.0043414-Szemenyei1], [pone.0043414-Tiwari1]. A recent interactome study revealed that Arabidopsis IAA8 interacts with TPR2, which is one of five TPL/TPR proteins [pone.0043414-Causier1]. To determine whether IAA8 also functions as a co-repressor of transcriptional regulation for the auxin response, as do the other Aux/IAA proteins, we examined the effects of IAA8 overexpression on the induction of early auxin responsive genes using XVE::IAA8 plants by semi-quantitative RT-PCR analysis. The early induction of three auxin-responsive marker genes (IAA1, IAA19 and GH3.3) [pone.0043414-Tian2] by Indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) treatment in roots was suppressed in estradiol-pretreated XVE::IAA8 plants, especially in line #11, which show drastic changes in root phenotypes ([pone-0043414-g002]), as compared with the wild type ([pone-0043414-g001]). Aux/IAA proteins generally possess a nuclear-localization sequence (NLS) and are localized to the nucleus [pone.0043414-Ouellet1], [pone.0043414-Hamann1], [pone.0043414-Abel2]–[pone.0043414-Muto1]. We used a polyethylene glycol (PEG)-mediated transient expression system in Arabidopsis mesophyll protoplasts to determine the subcellular localization of GFP fusions of IAA8, which functions as a transcriptional repressor ([pone-0043414-g001]), and also of the well-characterized Aux/IAA proteins, Arabidopsis IAA7 and IAA17. NLS-tdTomato, a nuclear marker consisting of a fusion of simian virus 40 (SV40) large T antigen NLS [pone.0043414-Lee1] and red fluorescent protein tdTomato, was co-expressed with the GFP fusions in protoplasts. IAA7-GFP and IAA17-GFP localized exclusively to the nucleus, as previously reported [pone.0043414-Ouellet1], whereas IAA8-GFP localized to both the nucleus and the cytosol ([pone-0043414-g003]). GFP fusions of IAA7, IAA8, and IAA17 were transiently expressed in Arabidopsis mesophyll protoplasts. NLS-tdTomato was co-introduced both as a nuclear marker and as a control for transformation. GFP, NLS, and BF (top) represent GFP and tdTomato fluorescence and bright field images, respectively. n: nucleus, c: cytosol. Bars = 10 μm. A key event in the transcriptional regulation of the auxin response is the degradation of Aux/IAA proteins that have been ubiquitinated by TIR1/AFB auxin receptors activated by direct binding to auxin [pone.0043414-Dharmasiri1]–[pone.0043414-Dharmasiri2], [pone.0043414-Greenham1]–[pone.0043414-Parry1]. Recently, the auxin-dependent protein-protein interaction between TIR1/AFB receptors and Aux/IAA proteins has been assayed using a yeast two-hybrid system [pone.0043414-Prigge1]. Therefore, we next performed a yeast two-hybrid assay to examine the auxin-dependent interaction between TIR1 and IAA8. The well-characterized Aux/IAA proteins, IAA7 and IAA17, were used as positive controls for this experiment. In yeast, IAA8, IAA7, and IAA17 interacted with TIR1 only on medium containing IAA ([pone-0043414-g004]), as previously described for IAA7 and IAA17 [pone.0043414-Prigge1]. To examine a possible auxin-dependent interaction between TIR1 and IAA8 in planta, we further conducted bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) assays using a transient expression system in Arabidopsis mesophyll protoplasts as described above. The N terminal of IAA8 was fused to the N-terminal half of YFP (nYFP) to yield nYFP-IAA8, and the N terminal of TIR1 was fused to the C-terminal half of YFP (cYFP) to yield cYFP-TIR1. The nYFP-IAA7 and nYFP-IAA17 fusions were used as positive controls and nYFP-GUS was used as a negative control. In the negative control experiment using nYFP-GUS and cYFP-TIR1, no YFP fluorescence was observed. Similarly, protoplasts expressing both nYFP-IAAs and cYFP-TIR1 did not show any fluorescent signal in the absence of IAA ([pone-0043414-g004], left). In contrast, auxin treatment resulted in strong YFP fluorescence in protoplasts expressing all of the nYFP-Aux/IAA fusions and cYFP-TIR1. This finding corroborated the auxin-dependent interaction between TIR1 and IAA8 as well as IAA7 and IAA17 in planta ([pone-0043414-g004], right). The YFP fluorescence resulting from the interaction between TIR1 and Aux/IAA proteins in BiFC assays was present only in the nucleus. (A) Yeast (EGY48::pJK103) cells were co-transformed with bait plasmid, which contained a LexA DNA-binding domain (BD)-TIR1 fusion (BD-TIR1) in pEG202, and prey plasmid, which contained activation domain (AD)-Aux/IAA fusions (AD-Aux/IAA) in pJG4-5. Auxin-dependent interactions in each transformant were assayed by plating on SD(Gal)/-Ura/-His/-Trp/-Leu medium with 100 μM IAA (+IAA). Auxin-independent interactions were examined using the same medium without IAA (−IAA). (B) The BiFC assay was used to detect protein-protein interactions between Aux/IAA repressors and TIR1. nYFP-Aux/IAA fusions or nYFP-GUS and cYFP-TIR1 were transiently co-expressed in Arabidopsis mesophyll protoplasts with a nucleus marker plasmid, NLS-tdTomato. To monitor the auxin-dependent interaction, 10 μM IAA was added before microscopic observation (+IAA). BiFC, NLS and BF (top) represent YFP, tdTomato fluorescence, and bright field images, respectively. n: nucleus. Bars = 10 μm. The expression of auxin-responsive genes is directly controlled by the transcriptional activity of ARF transcription factors [pone.0043414-DelBianco1]. Five of the 23 ARF proteins present in Arabidopsis function as transcriptional activators, whereas the remaining eighteen act as repressors [pone.0043414-Tiwari1]. At low auxin levels, ARF transcriptional activity is blocked by direct interaction with Aux/IAA proteins. Increased cellular levels of auxin result in the degradation of Aux/IAA proteins that have been ubiquitinated via their interaction with TIR1/AFB receptors and thereby promote ARF transcriptional activity [pone.0043414-DelBianco1]. The heterodimerization of Aux/IAA and ARF proteins occurs via an interaction between the conserved domains III and IV on both proteins [pone.0043414-Ouellet1], [pone.0043414-Tatematsu1], [pone.0043414-Uehara1], [pone.0043414-Hardtke1]. To clarify whether IAA8 interacts specifically with ARFs, we carried out another series of yeast two-hybrid and BiFC analyses. The semi-quantitative lacZ activity assays used to measure the protein-protein interaction levels in the yeast two-hybrid system showed that IAA8 strongly interacted with the C-terminal domain (CTD), which contains domain III and IV, of the ARF activators, ARF5, ARF7, and ARF19 ([pone-0043414-g005]). The lacZ activity for ARF3, which does not contain domain III and IV, was almost the same as in the negative control experiment ([pone-0043414-g005]). On the other hand, ARF4, ARF11, and ARF16, which are ARF repressors that contain domain III and IV, directly interacted with IAA8. However, the level of this interaction was much lower than that of the ARF activators ([pone-0043414-g005]). Western blot analysis of AD-ARFCTD proteins using anti-HA antibody reveals that the expression level of each ARF protein in yeast does not affect the intensity of interaction with IAA8 (Figure S3). (A) Yeast (EGY48::pJK103) cells were co-transformed with BD-IAA8 bait plasmid and AD-ARFCTD prey plasmid as in [pone-0043414-g004]. The strength of each interaction was evaluated by measuring β-gal activity using the o-nitrophenyl β-D-galactopyranoside (ONPG) method. Vector indicates empty vector (negative control experiment). (B) A BiFC assay was carried out to monitor the protein-protein interaction between IAA8 and ARFs. ARF-nYFP fusions or nYFP-GUS and IAA8-cYFP were transiently co-expressed in Arabidopsis mesophyll protoplasts with a nuclear marker plasmid, NLS-tdTomato. BiFC, NLS, and BF (top) represent YFP, tdTomato fluorescence, and bright field images, respectively. n: nucleus. Bars = 10 μm. To further analyze the in planta protein-protein interaction between Aux/IAA proteins and ARFs, we performed a BiFC analysis by transiently expressing ARF-nYFP fusions, the C-terminal fusion of ARF with nYFP, and IAA8-cYFP, the C-terminal fusion of IAA8 with cYFP, in Arabidopsis mesophyll protoplasts. The negative control experiment using nYFP-GUS and IAA8-cYFP did not result in any YFP fluorescence ([pone-0043414-g005]). As expected, protoplasts expressing both ARF3-nYFP and IAA8-cYFP also lacked YFP fluorescence, because ARF3 lacks domain III and IV [pone.0043414-Overvoorde1]. Using all other ARF-nYFP/IAA8-cYFP combinations, strong YFP fluorescence derived from specific physical protein-protein interactions was observed only in the nucleus ([pone-0043414-g005]).
!~MM~! Arabidopsis thaliana ecotype Columbia (Col-0) was used as wild type. Seeds of iaa8-1 [pone.0043414-Overvoorde1] were obtained from the Arabidopsis Biological Resource Center (ABRC). After cold treatment for one to two days to synchronize germination, all plants were grown on soil [2∶2∶1 mixture of Supermix A (Sakata seed, Japan), vermiculite, perlite] under controlled environmental conditions at 12 h light/12 h dark cycles at 22°C. To create the XVE::IAA8 construct, which consists of IAA8 driven by an estrogen-inducible promoter, XVE, in the pER8 vector [pone.0043414-Zuo1], the Arabidopsis IAA8 cDNA fragment was amplified by PCR with gene-specific primer sets (see Table S1) and cloned into pDONR207 (Invitrogen), using the Gateway BP recombination method (Invitrogen). After verifying the nucleotide sequence of the PCR fragment by sequencing, the IAA8 cDNA fragment was transferred into the modified pER8 estradiol-inducible plant transformation vector [pone.0043414-Zuo1], into which the Gateway cassette had been inserted using the Gateway Vector Conversion System, and the bar gene, for selection of transgenic plants, using LR clonase (Invitrogen), according to the manufacturer's instruction (Invitrogen). The resultant vector was introduced into Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain GV3101 (pMP90) by electroporation. The transformed A. tumefaciens was used for floral dip transformation of Arabidopisis Col-0 as described in [pone.0043414-Clough1]. Transgenic plants were selected on soil by spraying with diluted commercial BASTA solution (Bayer Japan) as described in [pone.0043414-Nakamura1]. All seeds were surface sterilized in 50% commercial bleach and 0.01% Silwet L-77 (Toray DowCorning), subjected to cold treatment, and then vertically grown on half strength Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium supplemented with 1% sucrose under the same conditions as for growth in soil. To monitor root growth and lateral root formation, seedlings were grown for 14 days. The length of primary roots and the number of lateral roots were determined for at least 20 seedlings in each genotype. The gravitropism assays were carried out according to Park et al. [pone.0043414-Park1]. The roots of two-week-old plants grown on half strength MS medium as described above were immersed in 10 μM β-estradiol for 24 h (estrogen treatment) and then transferred to 1 μM indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) solution (auxin treatment). Total RNA was isolated using Total RNA Extraction Kit Mini (Plant) (RBC Bioscience). First-strand cDNA was synthesized from 1 μg of total RNA treated with DNase I (TAKARA BIO) using the PrimeScript II 1st strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (TAKARA BIO). PCR amplification was then performed using GoTaq Green Master Mix (Promega). The gene-specific primers and PCR cycles for each gene are listed in Table S1. The fragments of IAA7 and IAA17 cDNAs and the C-terminal domain (CTD) fragments of ARF3, ARF4, ARF5, ARF7, ARF11, ARF16, and ARF19 cDNAs were amplified by PCR using plasmids harboring full-length Aux/IAA and ARF cDNAs from RIKEN Arabidopsis cDNA Encyclopedia DNABook [pone.0043414-Kawai1] as template DNAs, and then cloned into pDONR221 or pDONRzeo (Invitrogen) using BP Clonase II (Invitrogen). The gene-specific primers for PCR are listed in Table S1. After verifying the nucleotide sequence of PCR fragments by sequencing, the IAA8 cDNA fragment was transferred into bait plasmid vector pEG202gw, and IAA7, IAA17, and ARFCTD fragments were cloned into prey plasmid vector pJG4-5gw [pone.0043414-HoltIII1], respectively, using LR clonase II (Invitrogen). The Gateway-compatible SSP gold standard full-length cDNA clone [pone.0043414-Yamada1] of TIR1 (GC105370) was obtained from ABRC and used for transferring fragments into pEG202gw, as described above. A yeast two-hybrid assay using the LexA-based two-hybrid system was basically carried out as described in [pone.0043414-Kaminaka1]. Briefly, the transformation of EGY48 yeast cells (MATα ura3 trp1 his3 3LexAop-LEU2) harboring pJK103 [2LexAop-lacZ]) reporter plasmid was carried out with the Frozen-EZ Yeast Transformation II Kit (Zymo Research). The strength of interaction between IAA8 and each ARFCTD was evaluated by measuring β-gal activity using the ο-Nitrophenyl-β-D-galactopyranoside (ONPG) method, according to the Yeast Handbook (Clontech). To test for interactions between TIR1 and Aux/IAAs, transformants with both TIR1 in pEG202 and Aux/IAAs in pJG4-5 were transferred onto SD(Gal)/-Ura/-His/-Trp/-Leu with 100 μM indole-3-acetic acid (IAA). All plates were incubated for 2–3 days at 30°C. To confirm the expression levels of IAA8 and ARFCTD proteins co-expressed in yeast, the extracted total protein from each transformant was subjected to SDS-PAGE and then transferred onto Protoran nitrocellulose membrane (GE Healthcare) for Western blot analysis. Rabbit anti-LexA (BioAcademia) and rat anti-HA (3F10; Roche) antibodies were used for the detection of LexA DNA-binding domain fusion of IAA8 and activation domain with HA tag fusion of each ARFCTD, respectively. Luminata Crescendo Western HRP substrate (Millipore) was used for chemiluminescent detection. For the construction of IAA7-, IAA8- and IAA17-GFP fusions driven by the CaMV 35S promoter, all IAA cDNA fragments made as described above were transferred into p2GWF7 [pone.0043414-Karimi1], using LR Clonase II (Invitrogen). Similarly, for the construction of nYFP or cYFP fusion genes, which were driven by the CaMV 35S promoter for BiFC experiments, full-length cDNAs of ARF3, ARF4, ARF5, ARF7, ARF11, ARF16, and ARF19 were amplified by PCR using plasmids in the RIKEN Arabidopsis cDNA Encyclopedia DNABook [pone.0043414-Kawai1] as template and cloned into pDONRzeo using the Gateway BP recombination reaction. The gene-specific primers for PCR are listed in Table S1. After verifying the nucleotide sequence of PCR fragments of ARF full-length cDNAs by sequencing, nYFP-Aux/IAAs, ARFs-nYFP, cYFP-TIR1, and IAA8-cYFP fusions driven by the CaMV 35S promoter were constructed by transferring Aux/IAA, ARF, TIR1, and IAA8 full-length cDNAs into nYFP/pUGW0, nYFP/pUGW2, cYFP/pUGW0, and cYFP/pUGW2 [pone.0043414-Singh1], respectively, using the Gateway LR recombination reaction. As a negative control, nYFP-GUS driven by the CaMV 35S promoter was also created using nYFP/pUGW0 and pENTR-gus (Invitrogen), as described above. To create NLS-tdTomato, which was used as a nuclear organelle marker and a control for transformation, the amplified fragment of the simian virus 40 (SV40) large T antigen nuclear localization signal (NLS) [pone.0043414-Lee1] was cloned behind the CaMV 35S promoter into pDONRzeo (Invitrogen) and then transferred into pGWtd [pone.0043414-Momonoi1] using the Gateway recombination method. Mesophyll protoplasts from the leaves of four-week-old Arabidopisis Col-0 plants grown on soil were prepared and transformed using the PEG-calcium transfection method [pone.0043414-Yoo1]. Protoplasts co-transfected with 5 μg of GFP-fusion plasmid or 10 μg of nYFP- and cYFP-fusion plasmids for BiFC analysis and 1 μg of NLS-tdTomato plasmid were assayed for fluorescence 20–24 h after transfection using a confocal laser scanning microscope (Fluoview FV10i-O; Olympus). To evaluate the TIR1-IAA interaction by BiFC analysis, 10 μM IAA was added to the transfected protoplast solution 30–60 min before microscopic observation. The fluorescence signals from GFP, YFP, and tdTomato were excited by 489-, 480-, and 580-nm wavelengths, respectively, and emissions were observed at 510-, 527-, and 610-nm wavelengths, respectively. The data were exported as 8-bit TIFF files and processed using Adobe Photoshop CS5 (Adobe Systems).
