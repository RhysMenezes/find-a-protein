!~ABS~! The point of attachment of spindle microtubules to metaphase chromosomes is known as the centromere. Plant and animal centromeres are epigenetically specified by a centromere-specific variant of Histone H3, CENH3 (a.k.a. CENP-A). Unlike canonical histones that are invariant, CENH3 proteins are accumulating substitutions at an accelerated rate. This diversification of CENH3 is a conundrum since its role as the key determinant of centromere identity remains a constant across species. Here, we ask whether naturally occurring divergence in CENH3 has functional consequences. We performed functional complementation assays on cenh3-1, a null mutation in Arabidopsis thaliana, using untagged CENH3s from increasingly distant relatives. Contrary to previous results using GFP-tagged CENH3, we find that the essential functions of CENH3 are conserved across a broad evolutionary landscape. CENH3 from a species as distant as the monocot Zea mays can functionally replace A. thaliana CENH3. Plants expressing variant CENH3s that are fertile when selfed show dramatic segregation errors when crossed to a wild-type individual. The progeny of this cross include hybrid diploids, aneuploids with novel genetic rearrangements and haploids that inherit only the genome of the wild-type parent. Importantly, it is always chromosomes from the plant expressing the divergent CENH3 that missegregate. Using chimeras, we show that it is divergence in the fast-evolving N-terminal tail of CENH3 that is causing segregation errors and genome elimination. Furthermore, we analyzed N-terminal tail sequences from plant CENH3s and discovered a modular pattern of sequence conservation. From this we hypothesize that while the essential functions of CENH3 are largely conserved, the N-terminal tail is evolving to adapt to lineage-specific centromeric constraints. Our results demonstrate that this lineage-specific evolution of CENH3 causes inviability and sterility of progeny in crosses, at the same time producing karyotypic variation. Thus, CENH3 evolution can contribute to postzygotic reproductive barriers.
!~RES~! A. thaliana is a member of the mustard family (Brassicaceae), known for its agriculturally important Brassica crops. Analysis of CENH3 homologs from several species within the mustard family revealed that it is adaptively evolving, both at the Histone Fold Domain (HFD) and the N-terminal tail (NTT) [[pgen.1004970.ref011]]. Ravi et al. (2010) [[pgen.1004970.ref021]] had assayed CENH3s from species within the Brassicaceae and beyond for functional complementation of cenh3–1, a CENH3 null mutation in A. thaliana. They found that GFP-tagged CENH3 from Brassica rapa and Zea mays localized at A. thaliana centromeres, but only GFP-tagged CENH3 from the closely related species A. arenosa rescued embryo lethality of the cenh3–1. A caveat to these experiments was the presence of the GFP-tag. GFP-tagged A. thaliana CENH3 largely complemented the functions of the A. thaliana cenh3–1 mutation, but when crossed to wild type segregation errors were observed at a low frequency. This hinted that the GFP-tag is not entirely neutral. Thus, to assay only the effects of naturally evolved variation on CENH3 function, we decided to test complementation of the cenh3 null mutant using native untagged proteins. We chose CENH3 from B. rapa and Lepidium oleraceum, two species nested within the Brassicaceae family. L. oleraceum is more closely related to A. thaliana than B. rapa, but more distantly than A. arenosa [[pgen.1004970.ref022]]. To test for complementation, we transformed cenh3–1/CENH3 heterozygotes with constructs expressing genomic sequence encoding L. oleraceum CENH3 (LoCENH3) and B. rapa CENH3 (BrCENH3) under the endogenous A. thaliana CENH3 promoter. We recovered transformants that were homozygous for the cenh3–1 mutation for both variants in the T1 generation. This result is revealing in two ways: firstly it shows that the GFP-tag interferes with CENH3 function and secondly, it indicates that the previously defined boundary of functional complementation is incorrect. We further characterized the extent of mitotic and meiotic complementation in the T2 generation. A. thaliana plants homozygous for cenh3 null mutation expressing transgenic L. oleraceum CENH3 or B. rapa CENH3 were phenotypically indistinguishable from wild type ([pgen.1004970.g001]). We therefore conclude that B. rapa and L. oleraceum CENH3 can fully complement A. thaliana CENH3 mitotic functions required for vegetative growth. Transgenic lines for both CENH3 variants in a cenh3–1 homozygous background were also self-fertile. (A) Plants at rosette stage from different complemented lines compared to wild-type Columbia (WT) and GFP-tailswap, a high frequency haploid inducer [[pgen.1004970.ref020]]. The genotype of the endogenous CENH3 locus is indicated in parentheses. LoCENH3 is L. oleraceum CENH3 and BrCENH3 is B. rapa CENH3. AtNTT-LoHFD and LoNTT-AtHFD are chimeric CENH3s described in the key. (B) Anthers stained for viability with Alexander stain. Viable pollen granules stain purple. (C) Measures of fertility based on number of seeds per silique and seed appearance. Bars in different shades of grey represent counts from different T1 lines. For each measurement, seeds from 5 siliques were pooled and counted. To assay meiotic complementation, we wanted to identify plants that were homozygous for both the cenh3 null mutation and variant CENH3 transgene. Following segregation ratios of the transgene is not informative in a cenh3–1 homozygous mutant background, since individuals without transgenic CENH3 cannot survive. Therefore, we decided to use frequency of seed death in selfed siliques of T2 plants to infer the zygosity of the CENH3 transgene. Individuals that are cenh3 -/- and heterozygous for the transgene are expected to produce 25% seed death upon selfing. Assuming that the transgene is inserted at a single locus, individuals homozygous for the transgene are expected to produce 0 to less than 25% seed death if fully or partially complementing the meiotic functions of the endogenous A. thaliana CENH3. Using this criterion to infer the zygosity of the transgene, we measured fertility of A. thaliana plants in which the endogenous CENH3 is replaced by L. oleraceum CENH3 or B. rapa CENH3. We measured seed set and frequency of abnormal seeds in selfed siliques from three independent transformation events for each construct ([pgen.1004970.g001]). The complemented lines were comparable to wild type for both measures of fertility. Furthermore, viability-stained anthers from the same complemented lines showed live pollen numbers and appearance indistinguishable from wild type ([pgen.1004970.g001]). For L. oleraceum CENH3 complemented lines we further analysed meiosis cytologically with DAPI stained chromosome spreads from pollen mother cells (PMCs) in two T1 families, 2 and 19. Prophase I of meiosis in both lines was indistinguishable from wild type ([pgen.1004970.s001]). Chromosome segregation in PMCs at both meiotic divisions was checked for segregation errors. In the T1 = 19 family, metaphase I (n = 26), anaphase I (n = 7), metaphase II (n = 40), anaphase II (n = 5) and telophase II (n = 21) PMCs were scored, none of which displayed segregation errors ([pgen.1004970.g002]). Careful inspection of all post-prophase I PMCs sampled revealed some limited chromosome fragmentation in one anaphase II cell ([pgen.1004970.s001]). Although, the origin of this cannot be ascertained at present, its low frequency is unlikely to compromise fertility. Thus, we conclude that CENH3 orthologs can complement the essential mitotic and meiotic functions of A. thaliana CENH3 under standard growing conditions. Male meiotic chromosome spreads stained with DAPI for WT Col-0 (A-D, I-L) and L. oleraceum CENH3 cenh3–1/cenh3–1 (T1 family = 19) (E-H, M-P). Scale bar = 10μm. Next, we wanted to test how A. thaliana centromeres built on CENH3 variants functioned in comparison to those built on the native A. thaliana CENH3. To do so, we crossed them as females with pollen from wild-type (CENH3 +/+) Landsberg erecta (Ler) homozygous for the gl1–1 glabrous mutation, which confers a trichomeless phenotype. We chose Ler as the CENH3 wild-type parent because the complemented lines were generated in the Col-0 accession. This allows us to use polymorphisms between Col-0 and Ler to determine the parent of origin for all the chromosomes in the F1. In a standard cross we expect only F1 diploid hybrids with trichomes. However, if replacing the endogenous CENH3 with natural variants creates weak centromeres, then we can expect mitotic missegregation in the F1 zygote. The first indication of abnormal segregation in these crosses was the observation that 14–47% seeds aborted during development ([pgen.1004970.t001]). In contrast to the uniformly tan-colored plump seeds generated when the complemented lines are selfed, dark nearly black shriveled seeds were seen in crosses to wild type. Upon germination of F1 seeds from L. oleraceum CENH3 and B. rapa CENH3 crosses, we recovered diploid, aneuploid and haploid progeny. All haploids were sterile and paternal on the basis of having a trichomeless appearance, an expression of the recessive gl1–1 mutation. We confirmed the haploid genome content of 11 phenotypically selected haploids by flow cytometry ([pgen.1004970.s002]). Crosses were between cenh3–1/cenh3–1 + CENH3 transgene females and pollen from wild type Landsberg CENH3 +/+ strain homozygous for the gl1–1 glabrous mutation. Sterile offspring expressing the recessive gl1–1 trichomeless phenotype were scored as paternal haploid. Offspring with developmental defects were scored as aneuploid. Fertile wild-type offspring were scored as diploid. For each CENH3 construct we tested two individuals from each of the three independent transformation events (T1 families) in crosses to wild-type Ler gl1–1. Substantial variation in the frequency of haploids was observed between the different T1 families ([pgen.1004970.t001]). While the source of this variability is unclear, it is consistent with the variable haploid induction rates observed when GFP-tailswap is crossed to wild type. In cases where cenh3–1 is complemented with L. oleraceum CENH3, the frequency of genome elimination ranged from 2 to 11%. For B. rapa CENH3 complemented cenh3–1, the range was 1 to 2%. Although, L. oleraceum is more closely related to A. thaliana than B. rapa, substituting endogenous A. thaliana CENH3 with the L. oleraceum ortholog in an A. thaliana plant appeared to have a greater destabilizing effect on A. thaliana centromere as inferred from the larger frequency of genome elimination on average (6 ± 2.4% vs. 1 ± 0.2%). We have not observed any instances of aneuploidy and haploidy in the selfed progeny of the complemented lines ([pgen.1004970.s003]). In addition meiosis in L. oleraceum T1 families 2 and 19, which generated the highest frequency of haploids and aneuploids, is wild type in appearance ([pgen.1004970.g002]). From the absence of meiotic defects during selfing, we infer that the segregation errors and genome elimination observed in the crosses to wild type (CENH3 +/+) are not the byproduct of meiotic dysfunction in the inducer parent, but rather the consequences of postzygotic interactions in the hybrid embryo. From this we conclude that natural variation in CENH3 can cause centromere-mediated genome elimination and contribute to genetic instability through changes in ploidy. One of the hallmarks of centromere-mediated genome elimination is the generation of aneuploid progeny at a relatively high frequency (~30% for GFP-tailswap) [[pgen.1004970.ref020]]. Aneuploids have imbalanced karyotypes that perturb gene dosage, with large and variable phenotypic consequences. A. thaliana aneuploids exhibit morphological phenotypes in a wide variety of traits including abnormal leaf morphology, irregular branching patterns and infertility [[pgen.1004970.ref023]]. Using these criteria, we estimated that in crosses of Ler gl1–1 (as the wild-type pollen parent) to L. oleraceum CENH3 and B. rapa CENH3 complemented lines, the incidence of aneuploidy is 11.3% and 8.3% respectively ([pgen.1004970.t001]). We selected 48 phenotypically aneuploid progeny from each cross for whole genome sequencing to determine the relative dosage of each chromosome using a bioinformatics approach. Chromosomes and subchromosomal regions that vary from the expected number of 2 can be readily identified by increased or decreased read count relative to the rest of the genome [[pgen.1004970.ref023]]. We identified chromosomal imbalances in 73 of the 96 individuals selected for sequencing ([pgen.1004970.s004], [pgen.1004970.s005] and [pgen.1004970.s008]). In this dataset we found three classes of aneuploid chromosome types and an example of each is shown in [pgen.1004970.g003]. As a comparison diploid Col/Ler individual with 2 copies of each of the five A. thaliana chromosome is shown in [pgen.1004970.g003]. The first class contains numerical aneuploids where whole chromosomes are duplicated, as exemplified by an individual trisomic for Chr3 ([pgen.1004970.g003]). The second class contains aneuploids with truncated chromosomes, such as, for example, an extra copy of Chr5 with a truncated left arm ([pgen.1004970.g003]). Lastly, the third class displays dosage variation consistent with chromosomes that shattered and have gained or lost DNA segments multiple times across the entire length of the chromosome. An example for a shattered Chr2 is shown in [pgen.1004970.g003]. Based on our low pass sequencing analysis we cannot infer the chromosomal organization of these dosage variants presented here. Shown here are pictures of an individual plant alongside its 100kb bin dosage plot and 1 Mb bin SNP analysis across all five chromosomes. The red boxes indicate their relative centromere positions. (A) A diploid Col-0/Ler hybrid individual from a genome elimination cross mediated by LoCENH3. (B–D) The three major aneuploid types represented by examples of each: an individual with a numerical aneuploid chromosome (B), a truncated aneuploid chromosome (C) and a shattered aneuploid chromosome (D). (E–F) Percentage of each type of chromosomal variants of the aneuploids derived from a LoCENH3 (E) and BrCENH3 (F) genome elimination cross. Using SNPs between the parental lines, we were able to infer the origins of the copy variant regions (SNP plots in [pgen.1004970.g003]). In all three classes of dosage variants, the DNA contributing to the increased copy number originated from the transgenic Col-0 parent, in which the endogenous CENH3 had been replaced by an evolutionary variant. We even observed the loss of heterozygosity in the shattered Chr2 ([pgen.1004970.g003]), as a result of the complete loss of the Col-0 chromosomal regions. The largest fractions of aneuploids from these crosses were products of whole chromosome missegregation events ([pgen.1004970.g003]). However, there were also a considerable number of aneuploids with sub-chromosomal changes in copy number. This variation in dosage implies the creation of novel genetic karyotypes. In summary, centromeres built on CENH3 variants appear to missegregate in crosses to wild type. One consequence of which is aneuploidy and segmental dosage variants and with that the introduction of a broad range of phenotypic diversity [[pgen.1004970.ref024]]. Since our results negated the previously identified limits of CENH3 functional complementation, we decided to sample a larger evolutionary space. Flowering plants are divided into two major groups: monocots and dicots that diverged from each other 146–161 MYA. Rosids are the largest clade within the dicots, comprising of around 70,000 species including the model plant A. thaliana [[pgen.1004970.ref025]]. To better understand the extent of variation in CENH3 across the plant kingdom, we collated 67 CENH3 sequences from public databases that included homologs from green algae, mosses, monocots and dicots ([pgen.1004970.s009]). Using protein sequence from the HFD we generated a multiple sequence alignment and constructed a phylogeny of CENH3 in the plant kingdom ([pgen.1004970.g004]). This CENH3-HFD based gene tree was largely congruent with the accepted evolutionary relationships between these species ([pgen.1004970.g004]). The most striking feature of the tree is the size of its branches and the variation in their lengths, illustrating the rapid and variable rates of CENH3 evolution. We chose to test CENH3 from two additional species at increasing degrees of evolutionary distance from A. thaliana: grapevine (Vitis vinifera), one of the earliest diverging rosid species considered a basal rosid, and corn (Zea mays), a monocot. (A) Phylogenetic tree inferred by using the Maximum Likelihood method based on the JTT matrix-based model [[pgen.1004970.ref052]]. The tree with the highest log likelihood (-3935.2849) is shown. The tree is drawn to scale, with branch lengths measured in the number of substitutions per site. (B) Summary of complementation tests of A. thaliana cenh3–1 mutation with CENH3 from increasingly distant plant species. To test the functional complementation of these distant species, we made constructs expressing V. vinifera CENH3 and Z. mays CENH3 cDNA under control of the endogenous A. thaliana CENH3 promoter. These transgenes were transformed into cenh3–1/CENH3 heterozygotes. We recovered both V. vinifera CENH3 and Z. mays CENH3 transformants in a cenh3–1 homozygous background in the T1 generation ([pgen.1004970.g004] and [pgen.1004970.s006]). V. vinifera and Z. mays CENH3 have 21 and 38 amino acid substitutions respectively, relative to the 97 amino acid positions in the HFD of A. thaliana CENH3 ([pgen.1004970.s007]). Hence, it was surprising that both V. vinifera CENH3 and Z. mays CENH3 were able to complement the embryo lethality of the cenh3–1 resulting in plants undistinguishable from the wild type. To the extent that the complemented lines were self-fertile, we can say that both variants also fulfilled the essential meiotic functions of A. thaliana CENH3 ([pgen.1004970.g004] and [pgen.1004970.s006]). The L. oleraceum CENH3 gene has 12 amino acid substitutions in its HFD relative to A. thaliana and 31 in its N-terminal tail. We generated chimeric proteins in which the N-terminal tail of L. oleraceum CENH3 was fused to the HFD of A. thaliana CENH3, and vice versa ([pgen.1004970.g001]). We assayed complementation of cenh3–1 and found that both chimeras complemented the embryo lethality of the cenh3–1 mutation in the T1 generation. The chimeric CENH3s were also similar to wild type with respect to pollen viability as determined by viability staining and in number and appearance of developing seeds within siliques ([pgen.1004970.g001]). We then tested the functionality of centromeres built on these chimeric CENH3 transgenes by making crosses to wild type. It was immediately apparent by visual inspection of the resulting F1 seeds that the two chimeras had entirely different effects. The F1 seeds from the chimera with A. thaliana N-terminal tail fused to L. oleraceum HFD (AtNTT-LoHFD) crossed to wild type appeared largely normal while most of the F1 seeds from the L. oleraceum N-terminal tail fused to A. thaliana HFD (LoNTT-AtHFD) were abnormal in appearance ([pgen.1004970.t001]). We failed to obtain F1 seed germination from crosses of LoNTT-AtHFD to the wild type except from a single T1 family. In this respect, the function of the chimera, LoNTT-AtHFD, is reduced compared to the full-length L. oleraceum CENH3. We only recovered 124 F1 progeny from the LoNTT-AtHFD cross, of which 2 were haploids and 23 were phenotypically aneuploid. In contrast, we recovered a large number of F1 progeny from the crosses with AtNTT-LoHFD. However, out of a total of 554 F1’s none were haploids. This indicates that restoring the N-terminal tail to the endogenous sequence is sufficient to restore activity to a level similar to wild-type. Since our genetic assays highlight a critical role of the N-terminal tail sequence in segregation and genome elimination, we were interested in identifying patterns in its sequence evolution. N-terminal tails of CENH3 proteins are hyper-variable both in their amino acid sequence and length, ranging from 23 amino acids (Pisum sativum) to 194 amino acids (Brachypodium distachyon). Thus, reconstructing the evolutionary history of N-terminal tails from alignments of distant CENH3 lineages is not possible. Instead, we decided to use an alignment free approach and used the motif search program MEME to identify short conserved blocks of sequence homology in the otherwise unstructured N-terminal tail. A similar approach investigating N-terminal tail evolution in Drosophila species identified three conserved blocks of homology shared by all CENH3 alleles in that clade [[pgen.1004970.ref026]]. Our analysis of N-terminal tails includes variation from a significantly broader evolutionary timescale, with CENH3 sequences ranging from green algae to flowering plants. We identified seven stretches of conserved protein sequences, which we have termed Blocks 1–7 ([pgen.1004970.g005], [pgen.1004970.s010]). The over-representation of Brassicaceae-clade specific motifs (4 of 7 Blocks) is a reflection of our sampling bias, in which 22 of the 67 N-terminal tail sequences were from species within the Brassicaceae. (A) Schematic representation of CENH3 N-terminal tails from a subset of plant species, in the context of their known phylogenetic relationships. Motifs identified by MEME [[pgen.1004970.ref051]] are represented as different colored blocks. N-terminal tails are drawn to scale with the relative locations of each motif identified. The height of the motif block is proportional to-log(p-value). (B) Motif blocks 4 and 6 in Logos format. All instances where the motifs were identified are included below for comparison. Several interesting patterns were immediately apparent: First, Block 1 and Block 2 were identified in nearly all plant CENH3s and in canonical Histone H3 ([pgen.1004970.g005]). It appears that while the intervening sequence is highly variable in both length and content, the N- and C-terminus of N-terminal tails are evolving under strict constraint. These Blocks were not identified in H. sapiens CENH3. Second, in several instances where a species’ genome carries two copies of CENH3, there was differential retention of Blocks between the two copies, a situation analogous to sub-functionalization post gene duplication. For example, copy A of CENH3 in Arabidopsis lyrata is missing Block 6 but retained Block 3, while copy B is missing Block 3 but has retained Block 6. In Hordeum vulgare, the monocot-specific Block 7 is retained in copy A, but lost in copy B. Third, isolated Blocks were identified across long evolutionary distances ([pgen.1004970.g005]). For example, Brassicaceae-specific Block 4 was absent in all other lineages but present in V. vinifera, a basal rosid. Similarly, Block 6 that is present in most, but not all, Brassicaceae species, was also identified in two distant rosid species, Phaseolus vulgaris and Glycine max. The most parsimonious explanation for this pattern is that sequences homologous to Block 4 and Block 6 were present in the N-terminal tail of the ancestral CENH3 and were selectively retained or lost in the different rosid species. These observations suggest a modular evolutionary pattern where the constraints on individual Blocks are independent of one another. An outcome of this might be that the N-terminal tails acquire lineage-specific configuration of Blocks, thereby generating combinatorial sequence diversity.
!~MM~! Plants were transformed by the Agrobacterium floral dip method using standard protocols. Plants were grown under 16 hr of light/8 hr of dark at 20°C. For each cross, at least five flowers from an early inflorescence were emasculated and pollinated one day later with wild type pollen. F1 seeds were first sown in 0.5X MS plates containing 1% sucrose to maximize germination efficiency and then transplanted to soil. The L. oleracem CENH3 coding region including introns was PCR amplified from genomic DNA with the addition of SalI and XbaI sites at the ends. This PCR product was then cloned using standard restriction enzyme cloning into CP225, a cassette vector generated by Ravi et al. (2010) [[pgen.1004970.ref021]]. This vector is based on pCAMBIA1300 and carries the endogenous A. thaliana CENH3 promoter region i.e. 1489 bp upstream of the ATG, followed by a small linker region containing SalI and XbaI sites and finally the CENH3 transcriptional terminator i.e. 585 bp downstream of the STOP codon. All other constructs were cloned into a new Gateway-compatible cassette vector SM2 that was derived from the above CP225. To construct this vector, we used three-fragment multi-site gateway technology (Life technologies, cat# 12537–023) that allows simultaneous assembly of three DNA fragments in a defined order into a destination vector. The first and third fragments are the endogenous A. thaliana CENH3 promoter and terminator respectively, while the second fragment can be any CENH3 variant being tested. We PCR amplified the promoter and terminator sequences from CP225 flanked by the appropriate attB sites and recombined them via the BP reaction into pDONR 221 P1-P4 and pDONR 221 P3-P2 respectively, generating the following entry clones: pENTR L1-promoter-L4 and pENTR L3-terminator-L2. Next, we integrated these two along with pENTR R4-pLac-Spec-R3, the control entry clone for the second fragment, into the destination vector through a single LR reaction. The destination vector was a generous gift from the Pikaard Lab and was a modified pEARLEYGATE302 binary vector that has an additional ampicillin resistance gene for bacterial selection. We then did a reverse BP reaction with this intermediate expression plasmid and pDONR 221 P4r-P3r to replace the placeholder in the second fragment with the Gateway negative selection cassette [CmR-ccdB] generating the final cassette vector, SM2 = CENH3 promoter-attL4-CmR-ccdB-attL3-terminator in pEARLEYGATE302. The B. rapa CENH3 genomic sequence was PCR amplified from the GFP-tagged B. rapa CENH3 plasmid generated in Ravi et al (2010) [[pgen.1004970.ref021]]. A chimeric transgene combining the A. thaliana N-terminal tail domain with L. oleraceum HFD was constructed by overlapping PCR. The N-terminal domain included genomic sequence coding for CENH3 starting from the “ATG” up to but not including the “PGTVAL” motif and the HFD extended from the “PGTVAL” motif to the STOP codon. The reciprocal construct with L. oleraceum N-terminal tail domain and A. thaliana HFD was similarly constructed. Transgenic variants outside the Brassicaceae were generated using CENH3 cDNA. Z. mays CENH3 was PCR amplified from plasmid generated in Ravi et al (2010) [[pgen.1004970.ref021]]. CENH3 cDNA from V. vinifera was synthesized by GenScript USA Inc. Piscataway, NJ based on the Genbank sequence, 225454488. Genomic DNA preparation and PCR genotyping were performed using standard methods. cenh3–1 was genotyped with dCAPS primers. To genotype the cenh3–1 mutation in lines with the construct A. thaliana N-terminal tail domain fused to L. oleraceum HFD, we first performed a PCR reaction with one primer outside the CENH3 promoter genomic DNA fragment present in the transgene. This PCR product was then used as the template in the dCAPS genotyping reaction. For each construct transgene-specific PCR primers were designed and used to confirm the genotype of each transgenic line. Primer sequences are available on request. Representative images of rosettes were taken 25 to 30 days after germination. The percentage of normal seeds was determined by visual inspection using a dissecting microscope. On average, seeds from five individual siliques were pooled and counted for one individual from each T1 family identified as CENH3 transgene +/+ cenh3 -/-. Alexander staining of anthers was done according to published protocols [[pgen.1004970.ref046]]. DAPI stained male meiotic chromosome spreads were prepared as described in Ross et al. [[pgen.1004970.ref047]], and imaged using an Olympus BX61 epifluorescence microscope and Digital Scientific SmartCapture 3 software Flow cytometric determination of genome content was performed on floral buds using published protocols [[pgen.1004970.ref048]]. 0.1g leaf tissue from aneuploid plants were collected and purified using DNA Phytopure Kit (GE). Genomic DNA libraries were prepared using the standard NEB Next DNA Library Prep with NEXTFlex-96 Adapters from BIOO Scientific, pooled and sequenced on Illumina HiSeq 2000 for 50bp single reads. The resulting reads were mapped to TAIR10 using BWA followed by chromosome dosage analysis using the protocol described in Henry et al (2010) [[pgen.1004970.ref023]]. All the individuals that were sequenced and analyzed are identified with a unique FRAG identifier and are described in [pgen.1004970.s009]. Reference IDs for all sequences used in this study are available in [pgen.1004970.s008]. Multiple alignments of protein sequences encoding the histone fold domain of CENH3s was generated using MUSCLE and refined manually [[pgen.1004970.ref049]]. Evolutionary analyses were conducted in MEGA6 [[pgen.1004970.ref050]]. Phylogenetic history was inferred using the Maximum Likelihood method. The analysis involved 71 protein sequences. All positions containing gaps and missing data were eliminated. There were a total of 85 positions in the final dataset. MEME [[pgen.1004970.ref051]] with default parameters was used to identify statistically significant blocks of sequence homology in N-terminal tails extracted from 67 plant CENH3 sequences available from public databases.
