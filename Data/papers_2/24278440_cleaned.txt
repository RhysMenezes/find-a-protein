!~ABS~! AtKEAs, homologs of bacterial KefB/KefC, are predicted to encode K+/H+ antiporters in Arabidopsis. The AtKEA family contains six genes forming two subgroups in the cladogram: AtKEA1-3 and AtKEA4-6. AtKEA1 and AtKEA2 have a long N-terminal domain; the full-length AtKEA1 was inactive in yeast. The transport activity was analyzed by expressing the AtKEA genes in yeast mutants lacking multiple ion carriers. AtKEAs conferred resistance to high K+ and hygromycin B but not to salt and Li+ stress. AtKEAs expressed in both the shoot and root of Arabidopsis. The expression of AtKEA1, -3 and -4 was enhanced under low K+ stress, whereas AtKEA2 and AtKEA5 were induced by sorbitol and ABA treatments. However, osmotic induction of AtKEA2 and AtKEA5 was not observed in aba2-3 mutants, suggesting an ABA regulated mechanism for their osmotic response. AtKEAs’ expression may not be regulated by the SOS pathway since their expression was not affected in sos mutants. The GFP tagging analysis showed that AtKEAs distributed diversely in yeast. The Golgi localization of AtKEA3 was demonstrated by both the stably transformed seedlings and the transient expression in protoplasts. Overall, AtKEAs expressed and localized diversely, and may play roles in K+ homeostasis and osmotic adjustment in Arabidopsis.
!~RES~! The Arabidopsis AtKEA gene family contains six members, named KEA1 through KEA6 [[B3]], [[B9]]. Based on amino acid sequences, AtKEA are predicted to encode K+/H+ antiporters with 10 transmembrane spanning domains ([pone-0081463-t001] and [pone-0081463-g001]). The AtKEA genes are named in decreasing order of sequence similarity to AtKEA1, except for AtKEA5 which has a higher similarity (22.4%) than AtKEA4 (21.9%) ([pone-0081463-t001] and [pone-0081463-g002]). AtKEA2-3 are 29.9-84.5% similar to AtKEA1, whereas AtKEA4-6 are 75.0-83.4% similar to each other but only 21.9-30.0% similar to the AtKEA1-3 isoforms ([pone-0081463-t001]). The AtKEA gene family forms two subgroups in cladogram, AtKEA1-3 and AtNHX4-6 ([pone-0081463-g002]). The family members are listed in order of sequence similarity beginning with the prototype AtKEA1. Accession numbers corresponding to the GenBank database are given in parentheses. The predicted amino acid sequences of AtKEA1 (AEE27335), AtKEA2 (AEE81911), AtKEA3 (AEE82433), AtKEA4 (AEC06899), AtKEA5 (AED96117) and AtKEA6 (AED91722) were aligned based on analysis using the ClustalX 2.1 method. Identical or similar residues are blocked as dark or light boxes, respectively. Putative transmembrane domains were analyzed using the TMHMM method and are marked at the approximate TM regions. Cladogram analysis was conducted using MEGA 5.02. The alignment was based on the predicted amino acid sequences of AtKEA1, AtKEA2, AtKEA3, AtKEA4, AtKEA5 and AtKEA6. Evolutionary distances were computed by the Neighbor Joining method. The scale bar indicates the distance calculated from the multiple alignments. AtKEA1 and AtKEA2 have a long N-terminal domain, which contains 610 and 590 amino acids, respectively ([pone-0081463-g001]). The N-terminal regions of AtKEA1 and AtKEA2 have been predicted to carry a chloroplast transit peptide [[B46]]. The chloroplast localization of AtKEA1 has been identified by a mass spectrometry assay [[B47]]. The localization of AtKEA2 in chloroplasts has been visualized in seedlings transformed with the GFP tagged AtKEA2 [[B46]]. In addition, AtKEA1 and AtKEA2 have a long C-terminal tail, containing 224 and 222 amino acids, respectively ([pone-0081463-g001]), suggesting that AtKEA1 and AtKEA2 may have a distinct regulatory mechanism. Phylogenetic analysis shows that AtKEAs form a cluster with their E. coli orthologs EcKefB/EcKefC, separating clearly from the clusters of AtNHXs and AtCHXs with their yeast orthologs ([pone-0081463-g003]). Thus, AtKEAs may function distinctly from either AtNHXs or AtCHXs. Phylogenetic analysis was conducted using MEGA 5.02. The alignment is based on the predicted amino acid sequences. Evolutionary distances were computed by the Neighbor Joining method. The scale bar indicates the distance calculated from the multiple alignment. The accession numbers and sources of the Na+,K+/H+ antiporters are as follows: EcKefB(ACT40850), EcKefC(CAA40066), Escherichia coli; ScKHA1(DAA08706), ScNHX1(DAA12290), Saccharomyces cerevisiae; AtKEA1, AtKEA2, AtNHX1(AAD16946), AtNHX2(AAM08403), AtCHX1 (AEE29444), AtCHX17 (AEE84796), Arabidopsis thaliana. Protein organization analysis showed that AtKEA1 and AtKEA2 are comprised of a soluble N-terminal domain, a Na_H exchange domain and a C-terminal KTN domain [[B4]], [[B46]]. The long N-terminal domains of AtKEA1 and AtKEA2 were missed in early gene annotation. The cDNA sequences of the short version AtKEA1 and AtKEA2, AtsKEA1 and AtsKEA2 , lacking the N-terminal domains but containing the Na_H exchange domains, have been cloned in yeast by Dr. John Ward lab. We attempted to clone the full-length cDNAs of AtKEA1 and AtKEA2 genes. Since the direct amplification from the Arabidopsis cDNA preparation was not successful, we used a two-step strategy. We separated the gene into two pieces by choosing a restriction enzyme site in the middle of the gene; the two pieces were cloned separately. We then combined them to get the full-length cDNA. For AtKEA1, an EcoRI site was chosen to separate the gene into two pieces of A1-C1870 and T1871-A3582, and we successfully cloned the full-length cDNA. However, using the same strategy, we did not clone the full length AtKEA2 gene. [B46]) also failed to clone the full-length AtKEA2 in their study. The activity of the full-length AtKEA1 was tested in yeast. The full-length AtKEA1 did not confer resistance to high K+ and hygromicin B (50 ug/ml) in yeast growth compared with AtsKEA1 ([pone.0081463.s001]). Moreover, the full-length AtKEA1 did not confer resistance to high K+ at pH 4.5 relative to AtsKEA1 ([pone.0081463.s002]). Thus, the full-length AtKEA1 is inactive in yeast, whereas the AtsKEA1 is functional, suggesting that the N-terminal end of AtKEA1 may be an autoinhibitory domain controlling the transport activity. The subcellular localization of the full-length AtKEA1 was detected by expressing AtKEA1-GFP in yeast cells ([pone.0081463.s003]). The GFP fluorescence did not appear at clear cellular structures; instead, the proteins formed structureless clumps in yeast cells, suggesting that the full-length AtKEA1 did not distribute properly in yeast cells. To test the function of AtKEAs, the coding sequences of AtKEA1-6 were cloned in the yeast expression vector pDR196 and introduced into a Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain AXT3. Strain AXT3 lacks the functional plasma membrane Na+-ATPases (ScENA1-4), plasma membrane Na+,K+/H+ antiporter ScNHA1, and vacuolar Na+,K+/H+ antiporter ScNHX1. Thus, it is sensitive to salt and to high K+. The transformed yeast was grown on Arg phosphate (AP) medium with high levels of KCl or NaCl ([pone-0081463-g004]). AXT3 mutants failed to grow in the medium containing 800 mM KCl while the nhx1-positive strains (W303-1B and ANT3) grew vigorously ([pone-0081463-g004]). Expression of AtsKEA1 and AtsKEA2, AtKEA4, -5 and -6 recovered tolerance to high K+, similar to the AXT3 strains expressing ScNHX1 or AtNHX1 ([pone-0081463-g004]). However, the recovery capacities among the AtKEA family were different. AtsKEA1 and AtsKEA2 had the highest effect, whereas AtKEA3 had no effect ([pone-0081463-g004]). Interestingly, although AtKEA genes were well expressed in AXT3 mutants as detected with GFP tagged proteins ([pone.0081463.s005]), yeast growth was not improved in salt stress ([pone-0081463-g004]), suggesting that AtKEAs do not confer tolerance to salt stress. In addition, AtKEAs did not confer Li+ tolerance (data not shown). AXT3 mutants were shown to be sensitive to hygromicin B (50 μg/ml), and ScNHX1 and AtNHX1 enhanced tolerance to hygromicin B ([pone-0081463-g004]). While all AtKEA genes conferred resistance to the drug hygromicin B, AtsKEA1 and AtsKEA2 had the most effect ([pone-0081463-g004]), suggesting their roles in endosomal compartments. These results suggest that AtKEAs specifically facilitate K+ homeostasis, which is dissimilar to AtNHXs. However, AtKEAs are similar to both AtNHXs and AtCHXs in that all three function in endosomal trafficking. The cDNAs of AtKEAs, AtNHX1 and ScNHX1 were subcloned into the yeast expression vector pDR196 and transformed into the AXT3 mutant (ena1-4 nha1 nhx1). Yeast cells were normalized in water to A600 of 0.4. Aliquots (4μL) from normalized yeast cultures or 10-fold serial dilutions were spotted onto AP plates containing different concentrations of KCl (A), or YPD plates with different concentrations of NaCl (B), or hygromycin B (C). The strains were grown at 30°C for 3 days. AtKEA genes (except AtKEA3) recovered AXT3 mutant growth at 800 mM KCl at an external pH of 5.8 ([pone-0081463-g005]). However, the recovery capacity of the AtKEA family was significantly reduced when pH was dropped to 4.5 under 800 mM KCl, while AtNHX1 and ScNHX1 were still active under the same conditions. Furthermore, AtKEAs completely lost their functions at pH 7.5 at 800 mM KCl ([pone-0081463-g005]). Thus, AtKEAs require a specific pH in mediating K+ transport in yeast; either alkaline or more acidic conditions will affect their functions. AtKEAs were further tested in the yeast mutant strain AXT4K, generated by deleting kha1 in the AXT3 mutant background. AXT4 mutants failed to grow at low K+ at pH 7.5, while the kha1-positive strains (W303-1B and AXT3) grew dynamically ([pone-0081463-g005]). However, expression of AtKEAs failed to rescue AXT4K growth at low K+ at pH 7.5, while ScKHA1 and AtCHX17 enhanced yeast growth ([pone-0081463-g005]). These results indicate that AtKEAs, AtNHXs and AtCHXs may have different modes of action in facilitating K+ homeostasis. AtKEAs function at high K+ at pH 5.8 while AtNHXs function at high K+ in acidic environments and AtCHXs at low K+ under alkaline conditions. (A) The cDNAs of AtKEAs, AtNHX1and ScNHX1 were subcloned into the yeast expression vector pDR196 and transformed into strain AXT3 (ena1-4 nha1 nhx1). Strains were spotted onto AP plates containing 800mM KCl at pH 4.5, 5.8 or 7.5. (B) The cDNAs of AtKEAs, AtCHX17 and ScKHA1 were subcloned into the yeast expression vector pDR196 and transformed into strain AXT4K (ena1-4 nha1 nhx1 kha1). Strains were spotted onto AP plates containing 0.1mM KCl at pH 4.5, 5.8 or 7.5. Cells were normalized in water to A600 of 0.4. Aliquots (4μL) from normalized yeast cultures or 10-fold serial dilutions were spotted onto AP plates. The strains were grown at 30°C for 3 days. The transcript abundances of AtKEA genes were analyzed by RT-qPCR using gene-specific primers. Shoots and roots were isolated from 14-day-old WT seedlings growing on 1/2 MS medium. The transcripts of AtKEA genes were detected in shoots and roots ([pone-0081463-g006]). AtKEA2, -4, -5 and -6 had almost equal expression in shoots and roots; AtKEA1 and AtKEA3, however, showed a relatively higher expression in shoots than in roots, suggesting their dominant roles in shoots. AtKEA5 had the lowest expression in both shoots and roots. The differential expression indicates that AtKEA genes have diversified roles in Arabidopsis. Fourteen-day-old Arabidopsis seedlings (Col-0) were used. The relative transcript abundance of AtKEAs in shoots and roots were analyzed by RT-qPCR. Actin7 gene was used as an internal positive control. Error bars represent SE (n =3). Since yeast growth assays have shown that AtKEAs mediate K+ transport ([pone-0081463-g004] and [pone-0081463-g005]), we tested whether AtKEA expression was induced by K+. Interestingly, AtKEA1 expression was enhanced significantly under low K+ stress (0 and 1 mM K+) compared to the untreated control ([pone-0081463-g007]). The expression of AtKEA3 and AtKEA4 was also enhanced under low K+ stress, but AtKEA2, -5, and -6 was not. In contrast, gene expressions were significantly reduced for AtKEA1, -2, -4 and -6 at high K+ (160 mM) ([pone-0081463-g007]). The differential expression in response to low K+ stress suggests that AtKEA1, -3,and -4 are involved in K+ acquisition under low K+ conditions in Arabidopsis, whereas AtKEA2, -5 and -6 may have different functions. Fourteen-day -old Arabidopsis seedlings (Col-0) were cultured on the 1/2 MS medium or modified MS without K+ (0 mM K+) or supplemented with 1mM or 160mM KCl for 8h. Actin7 gene was used as an internal positive control. The transcript levels of AtKEAs in the untreated control seedlings were set as 1.0. Error bars represent SE (n=3). AtKEA expression was further tested under Na+, Li+ and sorbitol stresses. Interestingly, the expression of AtKEA2 and AtKEA5 was strongly induced under 320 mM sorbitol and 100 μM ABA treatments compared to their untreated controls, indicating that these two genes were osmotic responsive and were ABA-dependent ([pone-0081463-g008]). AtKEA2 and AtKEA5 were also induced by 160 mM NaCl, which was iso-osmotic to 320 mM sorbitol ([pone-0081463-g008]), suggesting that AtKEA2 and AtKEA5 are responsive to osmotic stress other than ionic stress. In addition, the expression of AtKEA4 and AtKEA5 were induced by Li+ stress compared to their untreated controls, while no induction was observed for AtKEA1, -2, -3 and -6 ([pone-0081463-g008]). Arabidopsis seedlings (Col-0, aba2-3) were grown on 1/2MS-agar media for 14 days. (A) Col-0 were continued culturing on the fresh 1/2 MS medium without or supplemented with 160 mM NaCl, 40 mM LiCl, 320 mM Sortibol, or 100 μM ABA, respectively, for 8h. (B) Col-0 and aba2-3 were continued culturing on the fresh 1/2 MS medium without or supplemented with 160 mM NaCl, 320 mM Sortibol or 100μM ABA, respectively, for 8h. Actin7 gene was used as an internal positive control. The transcript levels of AtKEAs in the untreated control seedlings were set as 1.0. Error bars represent SE (n =3). ABA regulation of AtKEA2 and AtKEA5 expression was further tested with aba2-3 mutant. The aba2-3 mutant is deficient in ABA synthesis but is responsive to exogenously applied ABA [[B61]]. Under iso-osmotic NaCl and sorbitol treatments, while the expression of AtKEA2 and AtKEA5 was induced in WT plants, it was not induced in aba2-3 mutants compared to the untreated control ([pone-0081463-g008]). However, ABA treatments strongly induced the expression of both AtKEA2 and AtKEA5 in aba2-3 mutants relative to their untreated controls ([pone-0081463-g008]). These results suggest that the induction of AtKEA2 and AtKEA5 by osmotic stress is dependent on ABA signaling. The Arabidopsis thaliana Salt Overly Sensitive (SOS) pathway controls ion homeostasis in plants [[B62]], [[B63]]. The SOS pathway is composed of SNF-like kinase SOS2 and Ca2+-binding protein SOS3. SOS3 perceives the ion stress signals and activates SOS2. SOS2 in turn activates SOS1, a plasma membrane Na+/H+ antiporter in Arabidopsis [[B15]], [[B17]], [[B62]]. In an attempt to understand whether AtKEA expression is regulated by the SOS pathway, we tested AtKEA expression in sos mutants by RT-qPCR ([pone-0081463-g009]). Interestingly, the expression of the AtKEA family in sos1, sos2, or sos3 mutants was not affected by salt stress compared to their WT plants with salt stress, suggesting that AtKEAs were not controlled by the SOS pathway under salt stress. On the contrary, AtKEA5 expression in sos1and sos2 mutants was consistently high compared to either the WT plants with salt stress or their untreated controls. Similarly, AtKEA2 expression in sos1and sos2 mutants was high relative to their untreated controls ([pone-0081463-g009]). These results suggest that AtKEA2 and AtKEA5 may be regulated negatively by the SOS pathway. Or, the induction of AtKEA2 and AtKEA5 is caused by the osmotic stress generated by the accumulation of salt in sos mutants. Arabidopsis seedlings (Col-0, sos1-1, sos2-1 or sos3-1) were grown on 1/2MS-agar media for fourteen days. Seedlings were continued culturing on the fresh 1/2 MS medium without or supplemented with 160 mM NaCl, respectively, for 8h. (A) Col-0 and sos1-1; (B) Col-0 and sos2-1 ; (C) Col-0 and sos3-1. Actin7 gene was used as an internal positive control. The transcript levels of AtKEAs in the untreated control seedlings were set as 1.0. Error bars represent SE (n =3). AtKEAs fused with GFP at the C-terminals retained resistance to hygromicin B in yeast ([pone.0081463.s004]). In addition, the GFP-tagged AtKEAs distributed properly in the transport activity test strains AXT3 and shared the same pattern as that in wild-type yeast (W303-1B) ([pone.0081463.s005], [pone-0081463-g010]). These results demonstrate that the AtKEAs tagged with GFP at their C-terminals retained activity in yeast cells. Wild-type (W303-1B) yeast strains harboring pDR196-GFP, pDR196-AtKEAs-GFP, pDR196-AtNHX1-GFP, pDR196-AtCHX17-GFP, pDR196-ScNHX1-GFP, and pDR196-ScKHA1-GFP (fused with GFP at the C terminus), respectively, were grown to logarithmic phase in SC-URA medium (pH 5.8) and were stained with FM4-64 dye. The subcellular localizations of the GFP-tagged proteins (green) and FM4-64 fluorescence (red) were observed under the Laser Scanning Confocal Microscope. Bars, 5µm. In wild-type yeast (W303-1B), AtsKEA1-GFP, AtsKEA2-GFP and AtKEA6-GFP had similar distribution patterns; the fluorescent signals appeared at a structure at or near the plasma membrane and a membrane structure in the cytosol. These structures were not overlapped with FM4-64 ([pone-0081463-g010]). The distribution patterns of AtsKEA1-GFP, AtsKEA2-GFP and AtKEA6-GFP were similar to AtNHX1 ([pone-0081463-g010]). However, AtKEA3-GFP shared similar patterns with ScKHA1; the fluorescent signals appeared at punctate structures ([pone-0081463-g010]). ScKHA1 has been determined to be localized to Golgi [[B64]], [[B65]], indicating that AtKEA3-GFP is localized to Golgi in the yeast cells. AtKEA4-GFP shared similar patterns with AtCHX17; the fluorescent signals appeared at a membrane structure in the cytosol that was not overlapped with FM4-64 ([pone-0081463-g010]). AtKEA5-GFP signals appeared at both punctate structures and a membrane structure in the cytosol; neither structure was overlapped with FM4-64 ([pone-0081463-g010]). These patterns suggest that AtKEAs have different distributions in yeast cells. We visualized the subcellular localization of AtKEA3 by transient expression in Arabidopsis protoplasts. Surprisingly, RFP-AtKEA3 fluorescence appeared on punctate structures in the cytosol but not in chloroplasts ([pone-0081463-g011]). RFP-AtKEA3 fluorescent signals were co-localized extensively with the Golgi marker GFP-AtSYP31, suggesting that AtKEA3 is localized to Golgi ([pone-0081463-g011]). (A), (B), (C) and (D): The transient expression of AtKEA3 in Arabidopsis protoplasts. A cis-Golgi marker GFP-AtSYP31 and RFP-AtKEA3 were co-transformed in Arabidopsis (Col-0) protoplasts. (A): RFP-AtKEA3 fluorescence image; (B): GFP-AtSYP31 fluorescence image; (C): Transmission image; (D): Overlay of the fluorescence and transmission images. Bars, 10µm. (E) and (F): The localization of AtKEA3 in root cells of the stably transformed Arabidopsis seedlings. (E): GFP fluorescence image; (F): Overlay of the fluorescence and transmission images. Images were observed under the Laser Scanning Confocal Microscope. Bars, 50µm. To verify the subcellular localization of AtKEA3, we generated stably transformed Arabidopsis seedlings expressing cauliflower mosaic virus 35S-driven AtKEA3-GFP. In consistent with the transient expression assay, AtKEA3-GFP fluorescent signals were visualized at the punctate structures within the cells ([pone-0081463-g011]). These punctate structures are the typical structures of Golgi bodies [[B66]], [[B67]], indicating that AtKEA3 is localized to the Golgi membranes. However, no fluorescent signals appeared in chloroplasts ([pone-0081463-g011]). These studies from both yeast and plants suggest that AtKEA3 is localized to Golgi.
!~MM~! Arabidopsis thaliana ecotypes Columbia (Col-0), mutants, and transgenic lines were used in this study. Arabidopsis mutant aba2-3 was ordered from ABRC；sos1-1，sos2-1，sos3-1 were gifts from Dr. Jian-Kang Zhu. In the growth chamber, plants were grown on compost (Pindstrup Substrate, Latvia) and subirrigated with tap water. Greenhouse conditions were as follows: 16-h-light / 8-h-dark cycles, light intensity 100 μmol s-1 m-2 photosynthetically active radiation, temperature 22°C. For plate-grown plants, Arabidopsis thaliana seeds were surface sterilized with 20% (v/v) bleach, after cold treatment at 4°C for 3 days, the seeds were germinated on plates with 1/2 strength Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium containing 0.8% agar, pH 5.8. For growth at low potassium, seedlings were cultured on a modified MS medium containing various concentrations of KCl [[B48]]. The predicted amino acid sequences of AtKEAs were collected from the GenBank (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov). Pairwise amino acid sequence were compared using EMBOSS Needle (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/psa/) [[B49]]. Proteins were compared by multiple alignments using the ClustalX 2.1 method [[B50]]. Phylogenetic analysis was conducted in MEGA 5.02 [[B51]]. The alignment is based on the complete amino acid sequences. Evolutionary distances were computed by the Neighbor Joining method. Bootstrap analysis for each branch was performed 10,000 times. Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains W303-1B (MATα leu2-13 112, ura3-1, trp1-1, his3-11 15, ade2-1, can1-100), ANT3 (ena1-4Δ::HIS3, nha1Δ::LEU2), AXT3 (ena1-4Δ::HIS3, nha1Δ::LEU2, nhx1Δ:: TRP1) and AXT4K (ena1-4Δ::HIS3, nha1Δ::LEU2, nhx1Δ:: TRP1, kha1Δ::KanMX6) were gifts from Dr. Jose M. Pardo [[B52]], [[B53]], [[B54]]. All strains used were derivatives of W303-1B. Untransformed strains were grown at 30°C in YPD medium (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone and 2% glucose). Transformation of yeast cells was performed by the lithium acetate method. After transformation, strains were grown on selective Hartwell's complete (SC) medium or APG medium (10mM arginine, 8mM phosphoric acid, 2 mM MgSO4, 1 mM KCl, 0.2 mM CaCl2, 2% glucose, and trace minerals and vitamins). NaCl, KCl, or hygromycin B was added to the medium. Drop test media contained 20 mM MES, and pH was adjusted to 7.5 with arginine [[B33]] or to acidic pH values with phosphoric acid [[B55]]. To clone the full length CDS of AtKEA1, we separated AtKEA1 into two segments, AtKEA1-F1870 and AtKEA1-L1712, respectively, by an EcoRI restriction site in the middle of the gene. Primers KEA1-SmaI F and KEA1-1996R ([pone.0081463.s007]) were used to amplify the AtKEA1-F1870 using the PrimeSTARTM HS DNA Polymerase (TaKaRa) by PCR. AtKEA1-L1712 was amplified with primers KEA1-1862F and KEA1-XhoI R ([pone.0081463.s007]) by PCR. The PCR product AtKEA1-F1870 was ligated into the yeast expression vector pDR196 at SmaI-EcoRI sites by T4 DNA ligase (promega), resulting in pDR196-AtKEA1-F1870. Then, the PCR product AtKEA1-L1712 was inserted into pDR196-AtKEA1-F1870 at EcoRI-XhoI sites to obtain the full length AtKEA1 (named as pDR196-AtKEA1). The full length CDS of AtKEA1 was verified by sequencing. For AtKEA2 (gene accession AT4G00630.1), a XhoI site in the middle of the gene was chosen to separate the gene into two pieces of A1-G2123 and A2124-A3525 (AtKEA2-F2123 and AtKEA2-L1402, respectively). Primers KEA2-NotI F and KEA2-2196R ([pone.0081463.s007]) were used to amplify the AtKEA2-F2123 by PCR. AtKEA2-L1402 was amplified with primers KEA2-2052F and KEA2-XbaI R ([pone.0081463.s007]) by PCR. The PCR product AtKEA2-F2123 was ligated into the yeast expression vector pYES2 at NotI-XhoI sites, resulting in pYES2- AtKEA2-F2123. Then, the PCR product AtKEA2-L1402 was inserted into the vector pYES2-AtKEA2-F2123 at XhoI-XbaI sites to obtain the full length AtKEA2 (named as pYES2-AtKEA2). However, after combining, mutations were generated at the region of A1302-A1308 which contains consecutive 7 adenines (As). Either 1 to 2 As were missing or added in the gene sequence. Similar mutations happened when we chose a KpnI site which separated the gene into two pieces of A1-C1359 and A1360-A3525. Thus, the full-length cDNA of AtKEA2 was not cloned in our experiments. To clone AtsKEA1(short form of AtKEA1 with 1857bp nucleotides), AtKEA3, AtKEA4, AtNHX1 and AtCHX17, gene fragments were amplified by PCR from Arabidopsis cDNA (primers are listed in [pone.0081463.s007]). To clone ScNHX1 and ScKHA1, gene fragments were amplified by PCR from the genomic DNA isolated from the Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain BJ3505(primers are listed in [pone.0081463.s007]).The PCR fragments were cloned into the same sites of the plasmid pDR196. All gene fragments were verified by sequencing. The cDNAs of AtsKEA2 (short form of AtKEA2 with 1860bp nucleotides), AtKEA5 and AtKEA6, ordered from ABRC, were cloned in the yeast expression vector pDR196 with the promoter PMA1. All plasmids were transformed into the yeast strain AXT3 or AXT4K; the empty vector pDR196 was transformed into the same yeast strains as a control. For stress tolerance tests, yeast cells were normalized in water to A600 of 0.4. 4μl aliquots of each 10-fold serial dilution were spotted onto AP plates supplemented with KCl, or YPD plates supplemented with NaCl as indicated, and incubated at 30°C for 3 days. Resistance to hygromycin B was assayed in YPD medium. 14-day-old WT seedlings, growing on 1/2 MS plates, were transferred into the liquid 1/2 MS media without (control) or with 160 mM NaCl, 40 mM LiCl, 320 mM sorbitol or 100 μM ABA, respectively, and maintained for 8 h (Yokoi et al., 2002). The total RNA was isolated using the RNAiso Plus (TaKaRa). The first-strand cDNA was synthesized from the total RNA (1μg ) using the PrimeScript® RT reagent kit with gDNA Eraser (TaKaRa), and was used as templates for PCR amplification. PCR amplification was performed with the CFX96 system (Bio-Rad) using the SYBR® Premix Ex Taq™ (TaKaRa). The Arabidopsis Actin7 gene was used as an internal control, and differences in product levels among the tested samples during the linear amplification phase were used to calculate the differential gene expression [[B56]]. The gene-specific primers are listed in [pone.0081463.s008]. To make GFP fusion constructs, we converted the vector pDR196 into a Gateway destination vector pDR196-GFP. GFP was fused at the C-terminal of plant or yeast proteins. Gene fragments of AtKEAs, AtNHX1 and AtCHX17 were amplified by PCR from Arabidopsis cDNAs (primers are listed in [pone.0081463.s009]). To make GFP fusion constructs for ScNHX1 and ScKHA1, gene fragments were amplified by PCR from the genomic DNA isolated from the Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain BJ3505 (primers are listed in [pone.0081463.s009]). PCR fragments were inserted into the plasmid pDR196-GFP using the Gateway technology (Invitrogen), respectively. Gene fragments were verified by sequencing. The recombinant plasmids were transformed into the yeast strain W303-1B. Yeast cells grown to logarithmic phase at 30°C in SC-URA medium adjusted to pH 5.8. For FM4-64 staining, yeast cells grown exponentially were harvested and suspended in fresh YPD medium, and then were incubated with FM4-64 dye at a final concentration of 5μM. After incubation for 8h, the cells were washed four times with phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and concentrated by centrifugation. After mixing with 0.6% agarose, the cells were mounted on glass slides and observed by a confocal laser scanning microscope (FV1000, Olympus) [[B57]]. Transient expression assay using protoplasts derived from the leaf mesophyll cells of Arabidopsis were performed as described [[B58]]. RFP gene was fused in frame to AtKEA3 at its N-terminus. The AtKEA3 gene was amplified by using the following primers: 5′-AAAAAGCAGGCTTCATGGCAATTAGTACTATGTT-3′ and 5′-AGAAAGCTGGGTCTTAATCTTGAGCTTTATCAG -3′. The PCR fragment was inserted into the plasmid pUBN-RFP [[B59]] using the Gateway technology (Invitrogen). Protoplasts were co-transfected with pUBN-RFP-AtKEA3 and a cis-Golgi marker GFP-AtSYP31. Arabidopsis seedlings of 4 weeks old were used for protoplast isolation. Fluorescence was visualized by a confocal laser scanning microscope (FV1000, Olympus). For the stable transformation assays with Arabidopsis thaliana, the GFP gene was fused in frame to AtKEA3 at its C-terminus. The AtKEA3 gene was amplified by using the following primers: 5′-AAAAAGCAGGCTTCATGGCAATTAGTACTATGTT-3′ and 5′-AGAAAGCTGGGTCATCTTGAGCTTTATCAGC-3′. The PCR fragment was inserted in plasmid pBIB-EGFP using the Gateway technology (Invitrogen), and the resulting construct was transformed into Agrobacterium tumefaciens GV3101. Arabidopsis thaliana (ecotype Columbia) wild-type plants were transformed [[B60]]. The transgenic plants were screened by basta spray; the basta positive seedlings were re-confirmed with PCR amplification of the GFP fragment. GFP fluorescence was visualized under a confocal laser scanning microscope (FV1000, Olympus). The excitation wavelength for EGFP detection was 488 nm. The roots of the transgenic seedlings containing the 35S-AtKEA3-EGFP fusion protein were visualized under the confocal microscope.
