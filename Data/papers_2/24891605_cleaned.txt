!~ABS~! A new homology search algorithm identifies novel KASH protein family members in Arabidopsis that act at the nuclear envelope in nuclear positioning and innate immunity.
!~RES~! Plant genomes do not encode any homologues of known opisthokont KASH proteins. The KASH domains of opisthokont KASH proteins and plant WIPs terminate in a C-terminal 4-aa motif (Fig. S1 A and Fig. S2 G), which is critical for interacting with the SUN domain and for NE localization ([bib48]; [bib30]; [bib43]; [bib58]; [bib68]). However, the KASH domains of plant WIPs and of animal KASH proteins share little amino acid similarity. Even among plant WIPs, the composition of the KASH domain varies significantly, except for the C-terminal 4 aa and, in particular, the terminal PT (Fig. S1 A). Thus, we define a protein sequence as a putative KASH domain when it fulfills all of the following: (a) it is immediately C-terminal of a transmembrane domain (TMD); (b) its length is between 9 and 40 aa (based on animal KASH proteins and plant WIPs); and (c) it is the C terminus of a protein and terminates in four amino acids with a given amino acid pattern. A Java program called DORY was developed to search for putative KASH domain–containing proteins according to these rules (Fig. S1 B, flow chart). In addition, we argued that if a putative KASH domain is present in most members of a protein family, it is more likely to be a bona fide KASH domain. Therefore, BLASTP (Protein Basic Local Alignment Search Tool) was used to obtain homologues of a positive output from DORY in the NCBI nr (nonredundant) database (in this study, proteins with an expect (E)-value < 0.0001 are considered as homologues). We first ran this method on the A. thaliana proteome using XXPT (X represents any amino acid) as the C-terminal 4-aa pattern. Four putative KASH candidates were identified—At1G54385.1, At3G03970.1, At3G06600.1, and At4G24950.1—and they are all plant specific (please see Materials and methods for details). At1G54385.1 and At3G03970.1 are paralogues in A. thaliana and are conserved across land plants ([fig1]). At3G06600.1 has close homologues in Arabidopsis lyrata and in the closely related species Capsella rubella and has distant homologues in other dicots ([fig1]). At4G24950.1 has only one homologue each in A. lyrata and C. rubella ([fig1]). Amino acid sequence alignment of the C-terminal domains of predicted plant KASH proteins. (A–D) Amino acid sequence alignment of SINE1/2 homologues (A), SINE3 homologues (B), SINE4 homologues (C), and SINE5 homologues (D). Full-length protein sequences were used for the alignment, and only the C termini are shown. Aly, A. lyrata; Ata, Aegilops tauschii; Bdi, Brachypodium distachyon; Cru, C. rubella; Csa, Cucumis sativus; Fve, Fragaria vesca; Gma, G. max; Hvu, Hordeum vulgare; Mtr, M. truncatula; Osa, Oryza sativa; Ppa, Physcomitrella patens; Ppe, Prunus persica; Ptr, Populus trichocarpa; Rco, Ricinus communis; Sbi, Sorghum bicolor; Sly, Solanum lycopersicum; Smo, S. moellendorffii; Tur, Triticum urartu; Vvi, V. vinifera; Zma, Zea mays. The numbers after the abbreviations are GI numbers. Locus names of A. thaliana proteins are shown in parentheses. Asterisks indicate that the protein models were corrected according to the predicted TMD-putative KASH domain architecture in the ORFs (see Materials and methods for detail). Numbers at the edges of the alignment indicate the first and last (terminal) amino acids of the domains shown. The Phobius-predicted TMD of the first sequence in each alignment is indicated above the sequence. Filled circles indicate proteins predicted not to have a TMD by Phobius. ClustalX color was assigned to the alignments. Analyzing the last 4 aa of these five candidates and their homologues revealed a new pattern of [DTVAMPLIFY][VAPIL]PT (brackets indicate alternative amino acid residues at the respective position). This pattern was used to search the nr database for putative KASH proteins in plants. Seven new protein families were identified ([fig1] and Fig. S2, A–F). The protein family shown in [fig1] was identified only in Medicago truncatula, and one homologue was subsequently cloned from Medicago sativa. The protein families shown in Fig. S2 (A and B) were only found in Poaceae. This search also came across a mammalian protein family, T191C (transmembrane 191C), which has a conserved TMD followed by a short sequence (∼40 aa) terminating in a conserved LLP[AST] motif (Fig. S2 G). Among these candidates, we chose At1G54385.1, At3G03970.1, At3G06600.1, and At4G24950.1 for verification and named them SINE1, SINE2, SINE3, and SINE4, respectively, because of their putative SUN domain–binding properties and NE localizations. We also cloned a homologue of the protein family shown in [fig1] from M. sativa (SINE5) for verification. To determine the subcellular localization of the chosen plant KASH candidates, transgenic wild-type A. thaliana lines were generated that express N-terminally GFP-tagged proteins under the control of the Cauliflower Mosaic Virus 35S (35S) promoter. Root tip cells of 7–10-d-old seedlings were imaged by confocal microscopy, and at least three lines for each construct were analyzed. As shown in [fig2], all five fusion proteins were associated with the NE. Subcellular localization of predicted plant KASH proteins. (A and C) GFP-tagged SINE1, SINE2, SINE3, SINE4, and SINE5 under control of the 35S promoter were stably expressed in wild type (A) or sun1-KO sun2-KD (C), respectively. (B) GFP-tagged SINE1ΔTVPT, SINE2ΔLVPT, SINE3ΔPLPT, SINE4ΔLVPT, and SINE5ΔLVPT driven by the 35S promoter were stably expressed in wild-type A. thaliana. Root tip cells were imaged using confocal microscopy. Bars, 5 µm. GFP signal is shown in green. Images in the second column of A are overlays of GFP and transmitted light images. Cell-to-cell variability of GFP fusion protein abundance was seen in all images. (D) The NLI was calculated and compared. As illustrated in the top of D, two maximum NE intensities (N1 and N2) and two maximum cytoplasmic intensities (C1 and C2) along a random line across a cell were chosen to calculate the NLI, which equals (N1 + N2)/(C1 + C2). Asterisks in D represent significant statistic differences when compared with GFP-tagged wild-type SINEs in wild-type A. thaliana (P < 0.01, two-tailed t test, n = 30). Error bars show SEMs. Next, we tested the ability of SINE1, SINE2, SINE3, SINE4, and SINE5 to interact with AtSUN1 and AtSUN2 ([fig3] and Fig. 4). Pairs of tagged proteins were transiently expressed under the control of the 35S promoter in Nicotiana benthamiana leaves and coimmunoprecipitation (IP; co-IP) assays were performed. To determine the importance of the C-terminal 4 aa of each candidate, deletions of these amino acids were introduced, and the resulting mutant proteins were designated as SINE1ΔTVPT, SINE2ΔLVPT, SINE3ΔPLPT, SINE4ΔLVPT, and SINE5ΔLVPT, respectively ([fig3] and [fig4]). To test whether the putative KASH domains of SINE1, SINE2, and SINE3 are essential for SUN protein interaction, they were replaced with RFYTKSAEAAAAA (SINE1XT), RFYTKSAEAAAA (SINE2XT), and RFYTKSAEAAAAAA (SINE3XT), respectively ([fig3] and [fig4]). The underlined sequence is the luminal domain of the ER tail-anchored protein cytochrome b5c from Aleurites fordii ([bib25]), lengthened with alanine residues to the size of the respective putative KASH domains. Co-IP analysis of SINE1/2–AtSUN interactions. (A) Domain organization of SINE1, SINE2, and their KASH domain mutants. The C-terminal 4 aa are indicated in bold. (B) Domain organization of AtSUN2 and its mutants. The C-terminal 30 aa of AtSUN2 are shown, and the residues changed in AtSUN2dMut are indicated in red. Diagrams in A and B were drawn to scale, with the gaps in A representing 300 aa. The numbers above each domain indicate the position of the first and the last amino acid of that domain. Magenta, domain N-terminal to the TMD of SINE1 or SINE2; blue, domain N-terminal to the TMD of AtSUN2; yellow, TMD; white, unknown domain; red, coiled-coil domain; green, N-terminal part of the SUN domain; orange, C-terminal part of the SUN domain. (C) SINE1 and SINE2 interact with AtSUN1 through their KASH domain. (D) SINE1 and SINE2 interact with AtSUN2 through their KASH domain. (E–G) AtSUN1 and AtSUN2 interact with SINE1 and SINE2 through their SUN domain. The asterisk in the bottom right of E indicates the codetected GFP-Myc-AtSUN2ΔNSUN band. In C–G, GFP-tagged proteins were immunoprecipitated and detected with anti-GFP antibodies. Myc-tagged proteins were detected with an anti-Myc antibody. The input/IP ratio is 1:9. Co-IP analysis of the SINE3/SINE4/SINE5–AtSUN interactions. (A) Domain organization of SINE3, SINE4, SINE5, and their KASH domain mutants. Diagrams were drawn to scale. Pink, domain N-terminal to the TMD of SINE3; cyan, domain N-terminal to the TMD of SINE4; dark green, domain N-terminal to the TMD of SINE5; yellow, TMD. The numbers above each domain indicate the position of the first and the last amino acid of that domain. The C-terminal 4 aa are indicated in bold. (B) SINE3 interacts with AtSUN1 and AtSUN2 through its KASH domain. (C) AtSUN1 and AtSUN2 interact with SINE3 through their SUN domain. (D) SINE4 interacts with the SUN domain of AtSUN1 through its KASH domain. (E) SINE4 interacts with the SUN domain of AtSUN2 through its KASH domain. (F) SINE5 interacts with the SUN domain of AtSUN1 through its KASH domain. (G) SINE5 interacts with the SUN domain of AtSUN2 through its KASH domain. In B–G, GFP-tagged proteins were immunoprecipitated and detected with anti-GFP antibodies. Myc-tagged proteins were detected with an anti-Myc antibody. The input/IP ratio is 1:9. In D and F, the vertical black lines represent the removal of empty intervening lanes for presentation purposes. GFP-SINE1, GFP-SINE1ΔTVPT, GFP-SINE1XT, GFP-SINE2, GFP-SINE2ΔLVPT, or GFP-SINE2XT was transiently coexpressed with N-terminally Myc-Flag–tagged AtSUN1 (Myc-Flag-AtSUN1). IP assays were performed with an anti-GFP antibody. As shown in [fig3], Myc-Flag-AtSUN1 was strongly coimmunoprecipitated with GFP-SINE1 or GFP-SINE2 but barely with GFP-SINE1ΔTVPT, GFP-SINE2ΔLVPT, GFP-SINE1XT, or GFP-SINE2XT. A similar co-IP procedure was performed to test the interaction of Myc-AtSUN2 with SINE1, SINE2, and their respective mutants. As shown in [fig3], Myc-AtSUN2 was strongly coimmunoprecipitated with GFP-SINE1 or GFP-SINE2, weakly with GFP-SINE1ΔTVPT, and barely with GFP-SINE2ΔLVPT, GFP-SINE1XT, or GFP-SINE2XT. These data indicate that the putative KASH domain and the C-terminal 4 aa are important for AtSUN1 and AtSUN2 binding. To test whether the SUN domain of AtSUN1 and AtSUN2 is necessary for this interaction, co-IP assays were performed with AtSUN2 deletion mutants ([fig3]) and SINE1. Myc-SINE1 was coexpressed with CFP-AtSUN2, CFP-AtSUN2ΔN (deletion of the N-terminal 106 aa), CFP-AtSUN2ΔCC (deletion of the coiled-coil domain, aa 205–225), CFP-AtSUN2ΔCSUN (deletion of the C-terminal 146 aa of the SUN domain), and GFP-Myc-AtSUN2ΔNSUN (deletion of the N-terminal 84 aa of the SUN domain). As a negative control, the unrelated GFP-NLS-GFP–nuclear export signal (NES) fusion protein was used. After IP using an anti-GFP antibody, coimmunoprecipitated Myc-SINE1 was detected by an anti-Myc antibody. As shown in [fig3], only the two SUN domain deletions were unable to coimmunoprecipitate Myc-SINE1. To further analyze SUN domain specificity of the protein–protein interactions, we introduced two point mutations in the SUN domain of AtSUN1 and AtSUN2. Based on the amino acid sequence alignment of AtSUN1, AtSUN2, and Homo sapiens SUN2 ([bib67]), two conserved residues in the KASH-binding pocket were chosen and mutated in AtSUN1 (H439A and Y443F) and AtSUN2 (H434A and Y438F, illustrated in [fig3]). The mutated proteins were named AtSUN1dMut and AtSUN2dMut, respectively. After N. benthamiana coexpression and co-IP, the ability of GFP-AtSUN1dMut and GFP-AtSUN2dMut to bind Myc-SINE1 or Myc-SINE2 was determined. As shown in [fig3], in contrast to wild-type SUN proteins, both mutated proteins barely interacted with either SINE1 or SINE2, confirming that the KASH-binding pocket within the SUN domain is required for interaction. [fig4] shows the comparable co-IP assays performed for GFP-tagged SINE3, SINE4, and SINE5 and their respective mutants, tested for interactions with Myc-tagged AtSUN1, AtSUN1dMut, AtSUN2, and AtSUN2dMut. IPs were performed with an anti-GFP antibody, and coimmunoprecipitated proteins were detected with an anti-Myc antibody. [fig4] shows a schematic representation of SINE3, SINE4, SINE5, and their putative KASH domain mutants. [fig4] shows that SINE3 strongly binds to AtSUN1 and AtSUN2 but that deletion of the C-terminal 4 aa, replacement of the putative KASH domain, or mutating the KASH-binding pocket of AtSUN1 and AtSUN2 disrupts this binding. Similar results were obtained for SINE4 ([fig4]) and for SINE5 ([fig4]). Losing interaction with a SUN protein leads to mislocalization of Nesprin-2 ([bib48]; [bib5]), Nesprin-3 ([bib30]), Nesprin-4 ([bib53]), KASH5 ([bib43]), and AtWIP1 ([bib68]). To determine whether this is true for GFP-SINE1ΔTVPT, GFP-SINE2ΔLVPT, GFP-SINE3ΔPLPT, GFP-SINE4ΔLVPT, and GFP-SINE5ΔLVPT, they were stably expressed in A. thaliana under the control of the 35S promoter. [fig2] shows that all five GFP fusion proteins were only weakly associated with the nuclear periphery and were abundantly found in the cytoplasm and/or associated with the plasma membrane and components of the endomembrane system. This demonstrates that the C-terminal 4 aa are required for efficient association of all five proteins with the NE. To compare the NE localization quantitatively, we defined an NE localization index (NLI) as the sum of two maximum NE intensities divided by the sum of two maximum cytoplasmic intensities ([N1 + N2]/[C1 + C2]; [fig2], top). The higher the NLI, the more concentrated at the NE the signal is. As shown in [fig2], deleting the C-terminal 4 aa of the SUN domain–interacting NE proteins (SINEs) significantly reduced their enrichment at the NE when compared with wild-type proteins (two-tailed t test, P < 0.01, n = 30). Finally, GFP-tagged SINE1, SINE2, SINE3, SINE4, and SINE5 were expressed in a sun1-knockout (KO) sun2-knockdown (KD; sun1-KO sun2-KD) double mutant ([bib68]), respectively. [fig2] shows that protein mislocalization similar to the deletion of the C-terminal 4 aa was also observed in the sun1-KO sun2-KD mutant, which is reflected by the NLI in [fig2]. Protein interactions will reduce the mobility of a membrane protein, and FRAP can assay this mobility difference ([bib50]). By expressing proteins in N. benthamiana leaves, the mobility at the NE of GFP-SINE1 and GFP-SINE2 with or without coexpression of AtSUN proteins was quantified by comparing maximum recovery values of FRAP. As shown in [fig5], the mobility of GFP-SINE1 and GFP-SINE2 was significantly reduced when they were coexpressed with either AtSUN1 or AtSUN2 (two-tailed t test, P < 0.01, n = 35). Coexpressing AtSUN1ΔNSUN with either SINE1 or SINE2 or coexpressing AtSUN2ΔNSUN with SINE2 had no effect, consistent with the finding that mutating the SUN domain disrupts binding in co-IP assays (two-tailed t test, P > 0.05, n = 35). A slight decrease in maximum recovery was detected when GFP-SINE1 was coexpressed with AtSUN2ΔNSUN ([fig5]). It is possible that AtSUN2ΔNSUN retains some affinity for GFP-SINE1, which was not resolved by the co-IP assay ([fig3]). Together, these data indicate that SINE1 and SINE2 interact with AtSUN1 and AtSUN2 at the plant NE. FRAP analysis of the interaction between SINE1/2 and AtSUN. Fluorescent protein fusions of SINE1, SINE2, and SUN proteins were transiently expressed in N. benthamiana leaves, and protein mobility was studied by FRAP. (A) Recovery curves of GFP-SINE1 alone or GFP-SINE1 coexpressed with RFP-Flag-AtSUN1 or RFP-Flag-AtSUN1ΔNSUN, respectively. (B) Recovery curves of GFP-SINE1 alone or GFP-SINE1 coexpressed with RFP-Myc-AtSUN2 or RFP-Myc-AtSUN2ΔNSUN, respectively. (C) Recovery curves of GFP-SINE2 alone or GFP-SINE2 coexpressed with RFP-Flag-AtSUN1 or RFP-Flag-AtSUN1ΔNSUN, respectively. (D) Recovery curves of GFP-SINE2 alone or GFP-SINE2 coexpressed with RFP-Myc-AtSUN2 or RFP-Myc-AtSUN2ΔNSUN, respectively. Color-coded asterisks after each curve indicate that the maximum recovery of that curve shows a statistically significant difference when compared with the black curve (P < 0.01, two-tailed t test, n = 35), whereas color-coded circles after each curve indicate no statistical significant difference (P > 0.05, two-tailed t test, n = 35). Error bars represent SEMs. No known domains are predicted in the newly confirmed KASH proteins by InterProScan, except for SINE1 and SINE2, which contain armadillo (ARM) repeats in their N termini. Because SINE1 and SINE2 are also the only known KASH proteins conserved across land plants, we investigated them in greater detail. To analyze the expression profiles of SINE1 and SINE2, we expressed N-terminally GFP-tagged SINE1 and SINE2 driven by their own promoter (SINE1pro::GFP-SINE1 and SINE2pro::GFP-SINE2) in stably transformed wild-type A. thaliana. In leaves, confocal z-stack images show that SINE1 was exclusively expressed in guard cells and guard cell mother cells ([fig6], [fig7], and Fig. S3 A), whereas SINE2 was expressed in epidermal cells, mesophyll cells, and trichomes but only weakly in guard cells ([fig6], [fig7], and Fig. S3 A). Both SINE1 and SINE2 are expressed in roots, without any obvious differences ([fig7]). These expression patterns were also recapitulated in A. thaliana lines transformed with SINE1pro::GFP–β-glucuronidase (GUS) or SINE2pro::GFP-GUS (Fig. S3 B, three lines of each construct were analyzed, and representative images are shown). Expression and protein localization pattern of SINE1 and SINE2 in leaves. (A) SINE1 is expressed in guard cells and guard cell mother cells (top, arrowheads), and the protein is localized to fibers in guard cells (bottom, arrows). (B) SINE2 is expressed mainly in epidermal cells and mesophyll cells and weakly in guard cells (circled by a dotted ellipse). The images are maximum intensity projections of a z-stack image. Autofluorescence of chloroplasts are shown in red and overlaid with the GFP signal. Bars, 10 µm. In the overlay images, asterisks indicate the nuclei observed, and P letters indicate stomatal pores enclosed by pairs of guard cells. Expression and protein localization pattern of SINE1 and SINE2 in trichomes and roots. (A) Expression and protein localization pattern of SINE1 in trichomes and roots. (B) Expression and protein localization pattern of SINE2 in trichomes and roots. Both genes are expressed in root cells, but only SINE2 is expressed in trichomes. Both proteins are localized at the NE. The trichome image of GFP-SINE1 was taken with 5× higher laser power (50%) than that used for GFP-SINE2, as indicated by the autofluorescence from the trichome cell wall. For the differentiated root cells, the nuclear surface was imaged to compare the fiber structure of GFP-SINE1 (outlined by dotted magenta lines in the overlay image) and relatively evenly distributed signal of GFP-SINE2. Bars, 10 µm. Diff., differentiated; Undiff., undifferentiated. Interestingly, GFP-SINE1 labeled a spotted, fiberlike pattern at the NE and in the cytoplasm of guard cells and guard cell mother cells ([fig6] and Fig. S4 A). In root cells, the fiberlike pattern was more prominent at the NE ([fig7]). However, SINE2 showed no fiberlike localization pattern in either leaves or roots ([fig6] and [fig7]). Because ARM repeats are predicted in the N termini of SINE1 and SINE2 (aa 3–286 and aa 17–289, respectively), the N-terminal 308 aa of SINE1 and the N-terminal 309 aa of SINE2 were fused to GFP (GFP-SINE11–308 and GFP-SINE21–309, respectively) and transiently expressed in N. benthamiana leaves under the control of the 35S promoter. GFP-SINE11–308 was localized to cytoplasmic fiberlike structures. We then coexpressed GFP-SINE11–308 with an F-actin marker, RFP-Lifeact ([bib51]), or a microtubule marker, MAP4-RFP, in N. benthamiana leaves. As shown in [fig8], GFP-SINE11–308 was colocalized with RFP-Lifeact but not with MAP4-RFP. The colocalization of GFP-SINE11–308 with RFP-Lifeact was also observed in root cells of stably transformed A. thaliana ([fig8]). In contrast, GFP-SINE21–309 did not decorate fiberlike structures in N. benthamiana leaves ([fig8]) and neither did the fusion of a larger N-terminal fragment, excluding the TMD-KASH domain (SINE21–521; Fig. S4 B). Both GFP-SINE21–309 and GFP-SINE21–521 had similar localization to the soluble protein GFP-NLS-GFP-NES (Fig. S4 B). This suggests that SINE1 associates with F-actin and that this property is not shared with SINE2. Association of SINE11–308 with F-actin filaments. (A) GFP-SINE11–308 was transiently coexpressed with RFP-Lifeact (first row) or MAP4-RFP (middle row) in N. benthamiana leaves, showing that GFP-SINE11–308 was colocalized with RFP-Lifeact but not MAP4-RFP. GFP-SINE21–309 was transiently coexpressed with RFP-Lifeact in N. benthamiana leaves (bottom row), but GFP-SINE21–309 was localized to the cytoplasm instead of F-actin fibers labeled by RFP-Lifeact. (B) GFP-SINE11–308 and RFP-Lifeact were colocalized in root cells of stably transformed A. thaliana plants. Bars, 10 µm. Because the ARM repeats of SINE1 are associated with F-actin, we reasoned that the NE fibers decorated by GFP-SINE1 ([fig6], [fig7], and Fig. S4 A) are likely associated with and/or depend on F-actin. Rhodamine-phalloidin (an F-actin binding dye) staining of the guard cells expressing GFP-SINE1 showed that GFP-SINE1 was colocalized with rhodamine-phalloidin–labeled fibers ([fig9]). After treatment with 10 µM Latrunculin B (LatB) for 1 h, the SINE1 NE fibers disappeared ([fig9]). In contrast, in the mock treatments, the NE fibers were barely affected ([fig9]). Next, we investigated whether the mobility of SINE1 and SINE2 at the NE was affected by actin depolymerization. As measured by FRAP, 25 µM LatB treatment increased the mobility of GFP-SINE1 (two-tailed t test, P < 0.01, n = 35; [fig9]) in guard cells but had no effect on the mobility of GFP-SINE2 (two-tailed t test, P > 0.05, n = 35; Fig. S4 C), consistent with a specific interaction between SINE1 and F-actin at the guard cell NE. Association of SINE1 with F-actin filaments in guard cells. (A) GFP-SINE1 is colocalized with rhodamine-phalloidin–labeled filaments in A. thaliana guard cells (arrowheads). (B) The SINE1 fibers in both guard cells and root cells are sensitive to 1-h treatment of 10 µM LatB, but the fibers (arrowheads) are still visible in the mock treatment. The images of guard cells are maximum intensity projections of a z-stack image. The differentiated root cell nuclei were imaged at the nuclear surface. (C) FRAP recovery curves of GFP-SINE1 with or without LatB-triggered F-actin depolymerization. A. thaliana lines stably transformed with GFP-SINE1 driven by the 35S promoter were used for FRAP. The asterisk indicates a significant statistical difference of the maximum recovery compared with the black curve (two-tailed t test, P < 0.01, n = 35). Error bars represent SEMs. Bars, 5 µm. To probe into the biological roles of SINE1 and SINE2, three SINE1 transfer DNA (T-DNA) insertion mutants (sine1-1, sine1-2, and sine1-3) and two SINE2 T-DNA insertion mutants (sine2-1 and sine2-2) were isolated. Further analysis showed that at least one downstream gene is missing in sine1-2, which was therefore discarded. sine2-1 carries the homozygous qrt1-2 allele ([bib12]), which was removed by segregation in the sine1-1 sine2-1 double mutant. All T-DNA insertion sites were confirmed by sequencing and are illustrated in [fig10]. RT-PCR shows that no full-length SINE1 mRNA accumulates in sine1-1 and sine1-3 and no full-length SINE2 mRNA accumulates in sine2-1 and sine2-2 ([fig10]). All mutant lines (sine1-1, sine1-3, sine2-1, and sine2-2 single mutants and sine1-1 sine2-1, sine1-1 sine2-2, and sine1-3 sine2-2 double mutants) appeared phenotypically normal under standard laboratory conditions. Biological roles of SINE1 and SINE2. (A) T-DNA insertion sites of sine1-1, sine1-3, sine2-1, and sine2-2. The left borders of T-DNA insertion sites were confirmed by sequencing and indicated by arrows on SINE1 and SINE2 genomic structures (drawn to scale). Exons are depicted as filled bars, and introns are depicted as lines. DNA fragments encoding the ARM repeats and the TMD-KASH domain are shown in red and orange, respectively. (B) RT-PCR determination of the expression levels of SINE1 and SINE2 in their mutants. Primers amplified the full-length coding sequences are listed in Table S2. (C) Example of measuring nuclear position in guard cells. An ellipse was rendered on a pair of guard cells, and the acute angle between the center of the nucleus and the minor axis (indicated by curved double-headed arrows) was measured. (D) Mean guard cell nuclear positions determined by the angle shown in C. Blue asterisks, P < 0.01 when compared with wild type after blue light treatment; blue circles, P > 0.05 when compared with wild type after blue light treatment; black asterisks, P < 0.01 when compared with wild type without blue light treatment; black circles, P > 0.05 when compared with wild type without blue light treatment. Two-tailed t test was used and n = 172. (E) Quantification of conidiophore formation on the cotyledon adaxial side as a measure of Hpa Noco2 growth on the indicated genotypes. Values are means ± SE of three biological replicates, each with n = 40. Asterisks indicate significant differences to wild type, and circles represent no significant differences to wild type. One-way analysis of variance (α < 0.01; n = 120) followed by Tukey’s honest significant difference test (α < 0.01) was used. Because SINE1 is predominantly expressed in guard cells, we examined guard cell nuclear positioning. The leaf epidermis was peeled and immediately fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde containing 4 µM Hoechst 33342. An ellipse was rendered on a pair of guard cells, and the acute angle between the minor axis of the ellipse to the center of the nucleus was used to quantify the position of the nucleus ([fig10]). Only guard cell pairs with a major axis of the rendered ellipse longer than 8 µm were measured. To avoid stomatal aperture effects on nuclear position, we irradiated the leaves with 100 µmol/m2/s blue light to open stomata before fixation. 86 pairs of guard cells were measured for each line. In wild type, the guard cell nuclei predominantly localized at the center of each cell, and this positioning was not affected in sine2-2 ([fig10], two-tailed t test, P > 0.05, n = 172). However, in mutants containing homozygous sine1-1 or sine1-3 alleles, the position of the nuclei skewed toward a greater distance from the center of a guard cell (two-tailed t test, P < 0.01, n = 172; [fig10]). We then measured the nuclear position without blue light illumination. As shown in [fig10], similar results were obtained, suggesting that stomatal aperture has little effect on nuclear positioning in guard cells. Guard cell nuclear position was also affected in sun1-KO sun2-KD (compared with wild type, two-tailed t test, P < 0.01, n = 172) and was similar to that of sine1-1 (two-tailed t test, P > 0.05, n = 172). Next, we measured the guard cell nuclear position in sine1-1 complemented by SINE1pro::GFP-SINE1. Three lines were analyzed, and in all cases, SINE1pro::GFP-SINE1 rescued the nuclear position of sine1-1, as shown in [fig10] (compared with wild type, P > 0.05; compared with sine1-1, P < 0.01; two-tailed t test; n = 172). Importantly, 10 µM LatB treatment also affected guard cell nuclear position and recapitulated the sine1-1 effect (compared with wild type or line 3, two-tailed t test, P < 0.01, n = 172; [fig10]). Mock treatment showed no effect (compared with wild type or line 3, two-tailed t test, P > 0.05, n = 172; [fig10]). These data strongly suggest that the AtSUN–SINE1 complex is involved in centrally anchoring the paired guard cell nuclei in an F-actin–dependent manner, likely by direct or indirect interaction of the SINE1 ARM repeats with F-actin. Upon contact with plant cells, filamentous plant pathogens develop haustoria, sophisticated feeding structures that form a specific membrane interface with the host cell. Haustorium formation leads to structural rearrangements in the attacked host cell, and this involves migration of the nucleus toward the infection site ([bib18]; [bib57]; [bib54]; [bib2]; [bib15]). To suppress plant immunity, pathogens translocate effector proteins into host cells, several of which are targeted to the host cell nucleus ([bib7]). We therefore tested whether immunity to the A. thaliana downy mildew pathogen Hyaloperonospora arabidopsidis (Hpa) is altered in SINE1 and SINE2 mutants. 10-d-old seedlings were infected with Hpa isolate Noco2 that infects Col-0, and the severity of the infection was quantified by counting the conidiophores that emerged from the upper side of the cotyledons 6 d after infection. As shown in [fig10], sine2-2, sine1-1 sine2-1, and sine1-1 sine2-2 were more susceptible to Hpa Noco2 than wild type, but sine1-1 behaved like wild type (one-way analysis of variance α < 0.01 followed by Tukey’s honest significant difference test α < 0.01, n = 120). Expression of SINE2pro::GFP-SINE2 in the sine1-1 sine2-1 double mutant complemented the enhanced disease susceptibility phenotype in two independent transgenic lines ([fig10]). These results suggest that SINE2, but not SINE1, contributes significantly to plant immunity against Hpa.
!~MM~! Please refer to Fig. S1 B for details of DORY and Supplemental material. The TAIR10 protein models were downloaded from TAIR (The Arabidopsis Information Resource). The nr database is constantly updated, which affects the results of our program and NCBI BLASTP. The one used here was downloaded on February 19, 2013. To develop the C-terminal 4-aa pattern of plant KASH proteins, we searched the A. thaliana TAIR10 protein models using our program with pattern XXPT (X represents any amino acid). Five protein models were identified: At1G54385.1, At3G03970.1, At3G06600.1, At4G24950.1, and At3G47410.1. Homologues of newly identified plant KASH candidates were obtained using NCBI BLASTP on June 3, 2013 (proteins with E value < 0.0001 were considered homologues), and the TMD prediction program Phobius (http://phobius.sbc.su.se/; [bib27]) was used to support the existence of a TMD. For convenience, the GenInfo Identifier (GI) number is used to represent the corresponding protein in this study. If the majority of a protein family terminates in a putative KASH domain, this protein family was considered a positive candidate. Among the five protein models identified, At1G54385.1 (SINE1), At3G03970.1 (SINE2), At3G06600.1 (SINE3), and At4G24950.1 (SINE4) were positive candidates ([fig1]). At3G47410.1 has one homologue in A. thaliana, two in A. lyrata, and one in C. rubella. Two A. thaliana homologues do not possess a putative KASH domain. It was therefore considered a false positive. Analyzing the C-terminal 4 aa of homologues of WIP1/2/3, SINE1/2, SINE3, and SINE4 revealed a new pattern of [DTVAMPLIFY][VAPIL]PT (brackets indicate alternative amino acid residues at the respective position). This pattern was used to search the nr database for putative KASH proteins in plants using DORY. We performed BLASTP using the protein sequence of SINE1 and SINE2 (which are conserved across land plants) against individual nonplant organisms, such as H. sapiens, Mus musculus, Caenorhabditis elegans, Drosophila melanogaster, S. pombe, and Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and no homologues were found. We also performed BLASTN using genomic sequence of SINE1, SINE2, SINE3, and SINE4 and SINE5 against nonplant genomes and obtained no hits. These results suggest that all SINEs are indeed plant specific, and they could not have been identified by homologous searches, such as BLASTN or BLASTP. For the animal KASH protein search, homologues of known animal KASH proteins—Nesprin-1, Nesprin-3, Nesprin-4, Klarsicht, UNC-83, KASH5, and Lrmp—were obtained by BLASTP. Sequences containing no proline in the C-terminal 4 aa were submitted to BLASTP and removed if the closest homologue was not a KASH protein. The C-terminal 4-aa pattern [PATHQL]PP[QTVFILM], or very rarely PLPV, PSPT, or PPKA, was derived from the final KASH protein pool. Pattern [PATHQL]PP[QTVFILM] was used to search for putative animal KASH proteins. All alignments were performed by using MAFFT ([bib29]) with default settings and the E-INS-i strategy, except for the alignment in Fig. S2 G, for which the G-INS-i strategy was used. While searching for homologues of newly identified putative KASH proteins, we found many proteins share high similarities at the N termini but lack a putative KASH domain. Some of these cases were a result of a probably mispredicted intron and were then corrected based on the TMD-putative KASH domain architecture.

A. thaliana (Columbia ecotype) were grown at 25°C in soil under 16-h light and 8-h dark or on Murashige and Skoog (Caisson Laboratories) medium with 1% sucrose under constant light. Ecotype Col-0 was used as wild type. The sun1-KO sun2-KD mutant was a gift from S. Armstrong and K. Osman (University of Birmingham, Birmingham, England, UK) and has been reported previously ([bib68]). sun1-KO (SALK_123093) is in Col-0 background with the T-DNA inserted in the first intron. sun2-KD (SALK_049398) is in Col-0 background with the T-DNA inserted in the 3′ UTR. N. benthamiana plants were grown at 28°C in soil under constant light. sine1-1 (SALK_018239C), sine1-2 (SALK_143274), sine2-1 (CS801355), and sine2-2 (CS1006876) were obtained from the Arabidopsis Biological Resource Center. sine1-3 (GK-485E08-019738) was obtained from GABI-Kat. The primers used for genotyping are listed in Table S2. Genotyping of the qrt1-2 allele in sine2-1 was performed as reported by [bib12]. CFP-AtSUN2, CFP-AtSUN2ΔN, CFP-AtSUN2ΔCC, and CFP-AtSUN2ΔCSUN were described by [bib17]. In brief, coding sequences of AtSUN2, AtSUN2ΔN, AtSUN2ΔCC, and AtSUN2ΔCSUN were amplified by PCR and cloned into the pDONR207 vector. After confirmation by sequencing, they were moved to pB7WGC2 ([bib28]) by LR reaction (Invitrogen) to obtain the CFP-fused constructs. Myc-Flag-AtSUN1, Myc-AtSUN2, GFP-Myc-AtSUN2ΔNSUN, RFP-Flag-AtSUN1, RFP-Flag-AtSUN1ΔNSUN, RFP-Myc-AtSUN2, and RFP-Myc-AtSUN2ΔNSUN were described previously ([bib68]). In brief, coding sequences of Flag-AtSUN1, Myc-AtSUN2, Flag-AtSUN1ΔNSUN, and Myc-AtSUN2ΔNSUN were amplified by overlap extension PCR and were cloned into the pENTR/D-TOPO (Invitrogen) vector. After sequencing, the coding sequences were moved from pENTR/D-TOPO to destination vectors by LR reaction. Flag-AtSUN1 and Myc-AtSUN2 were moved to pGWB21 ([bib44]) to obtain Myc-Flag-AtSUN1 and Myc-AtSUN2. Myc-AtSUN2ΔNSUN was moved to pK7WGF2 ([bib28]) to obtain GFP-Myc-AtSUN2ΔNSUN. Flag-AtSUN1, Flag-AtSUN1ΔNSUN, Myc-AtSUN2, and Myc-AtSUN2ΔNSUN were moved to pK7WGR2 ([bib28]) to obtain the RFP-fused constructs. PCR-based cloning was used to generate the other constructs, and the primers used are listed in Table S1. In brief, Lifeact was amplified by PCR using a self-annealing primer pair without templates and cloned to pENTR/D-TOPO. RT-PCR was used to amplify SINE1, SINE2, SINE3, and SINE5 from cDNA. SINE4 was amplified directly from wild-type genomic DNA by PCR. NLS-GFP-NES was amplified by overlapping PCR using vector pK7WGF2 as a template. All PCR products were cloned into the pENTR/D-TOPO vector and confirmed by sequencing. These clones were then used as templates for amplifying SINE1ΔTVPT, SINE1XT, SINE11–308, SINE2ΔLVPT, SINE2XT, SINE21–309, SINE2ΔKASH, SINE3ΔPLPT, SINE3XT, SINE4ΔLVPT, and SINE5ΔLVPT by PCR. PCR products were cloned into pENTR/D-TOPO vector and confirmed by sequencing. The coding sequences cloned into pENTR/D-TOPO were moved to destination vectors described by [bib28] by LR reaction (Invitrogen) to obtain N-terminal GFP-tagged protein constructs: Lifeact was cloned into pH7WGR2; SINE1, SINE1ΔTVPT, SINE1XT, SINE11–308, SINE2, SINE2ΔLVPT, SINE2XT, SINE21–309, SINE2ΔKASH, SINE3ΔPLPT, SINE3XT, SINE4, SINE4ΔLVPT, SINE5ΔLVPT, and NLS-GFP-NES were cloned into pK7WGF2; and SINE3 and SINE5 were cloned into pH7WGF2. Flag-AtSUN1dMut and Myc-AtSUN2dMut were obtained using the site-directed mutagenesis kit (QuikChange; Agilent Technologies), and the pENTR/D-TOPO vector containing the Flag-AtSUN1 or the Myc-AtSUN2 coding sequences described by [bib68] was used as a template. After sequencing, Flag-AtSUN1dMut and Myc-AtSUN2dMut were cloned into pGWB21 to obtain Myc-Flag-AtSUN1dMut and Myc-AtSUN2dMut, respectively. The hygromycin B resistance cassette was amplified by PCR from the vector pH2GW7 ([bib28]) using 5′-AATGAATTCATCAGCTTGCATGCCGGTCGATC-3′ and 5′-GCTGAATTCATCATACATGAGAATTAAGGGAGTC-3′ (the EcoRI site is underlined), digested by EcoRI, and then ligated with the EcoRI-digested binary vector pPZP-RCS2 ([bib13]). After confirmation by sequencing, the pPZP-RCS2-Hyg vector was obtained. The GFP-Gateway-35ST (35S terminator of Cauliflower Mosaic Virus) cassette was amplified by PCR using 5′-TATGGCGCGC[CACGTG]AGCAAGGGCGAGGAGCTGTTC-3′ (the AscI site is underlined, and the PmlI site is shown in brackets) and 5′-CCGGGGATCCTCTAGAGGGCC-3′ (the XbaI site is underlined), digested by AscI and XbaI, and ligated with the AscI–XbaI-digested pPZP-RCS2-Hyg. After confirmation by sequencing, the pHOAG vector was obtained. SINE1 and SINE2 promoters were amplified from A. thaliana genomic DNA (∼2 kb; primers used are listed in Table S1), digested with AscI, and linked to the AscI–PmlI-digested pHOAG to obtain pHSINE1proAG and pHSINE2proAG, respectively. By LR reaction, the SINE1 coding sequence was moved from the pENTR/D-TOPO to pHSINE1proAG to obtain the SINE1pro::GFP-SINE1 construct, and the SINE2 coding sequence was moved from the pENTR/D-TOPO to pHSINE2proAG to obtain the SINE2pro::GFP-SINE1 construct. A. tumefaciens strain ABI was transformed with the corresponding constructs by triparental mating ([bib63]). In brief, the Escherichia coli carrying the constructs of interest were co-incubated overnight at 30°C on lysogeny broth agar (1.5%) plates with A. tumefaciens ABI and the E. coli helper strain containing the vector pRK2013. Then, the bacterial mixture was streaked on lysogeny broth agar (1.5%) plates with proper antibiotics to select transformed A. tumefaciens, which was confirmed by PCR. A. tumefaciens cultures containing plasmids expressing the proteins of interest were co-infiltrated transiently into N. benthamiana leaves as described previously ([bib59]). In brief, A. tumefaciens cultures were collected by centrifuging and resuspended to OD600 = 1.0 in the infiltration buffer containing 10 mM MgCl2, 10 mM MES, pH 5.4, and 100 µM acetosyringone (Sigma-Aldrich). The A. tumefaciens suspension was pressure infiltrated into N. benthamiana leaves with a plastic syringe. Plants were grown for 2–3 d before being collected for the subsequence experiments. Transgenic A. thaliana plants were obtained by A. tumefaciens–mediated floral dip ([bib3]). A. tumefaciens strains carrying the constructs of interest were inoculated in lysogeny broth liquid medium and grown overnight at 30°C. The bacteria were collected by centrifuging and resuspended in transformation solution containing 5% sucrose and 300 µl/liter Silwet L-77 (Lehle Seeds) to OD600 = 0.8. The inflorescence part of A. thaliana was dipped in the bacterial suspension. After being kept moist in the dark overnight at room temperature, the plants were moved to a growth chamber and allowed to set seeds. The transgenic plants were selected on Murashige and Skoog agar (0.8%) plates containing kanamycin or Basta (Sigma-Aldrich). N. benthamiana leaves were collected and ground in liquid nitrogen into powders, and co-IP experiments were performed at 4°C. 1 ml radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% Na-deoxycholate, 1% NP-40, 1 mM PMSF, and 1% protease inhibitor cocktail [Sigma-Aldrich]) was used to extract 500 µl of plant tissue. One tenth of the protein extracts was used as the input sample, and the rest were used for IP using protein A–Sepharose beads (GE Healthcare) precoated with a rabbit anti-GFP antibody (ab290; Abcam). After 3× wash using radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer, the immunoprecipitates and the input samples were separated by 8 or 10% SDS-PAGE, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Bio-Rad Laboratories), and detected with a mouse anti-GFP (1:2,000; 632569; Takara Bio Inc.) or a mouse anti-Myc (1:,000; M5546; Sigma-Aldrich) antibody. The input/IP ratio is 1:9. 7–10-d-old A. thaliana seedlings were imaged using a confocal microscope (Eclipse C90i; Nikon) with small or medium pinhole and gain setting range of 7.0–7.5. The 488-nm laser was set at 40% power for imaging sun1-KO sun2-KD transgenic plants whose transgene expression was low in all lines, whereas the other transgenic lines and N. benthamiana leaves were imaged using 10–20% laser power. All images were taken at room temperature using water as the medium with a Plan Apochromat VC 60× H lens (numerical aperture of 1.4; Nikon). The transmitted light detector was turned on to collect transmitted light signal simultaneously. Images were exported to PNG format by NIS-Elements software (Nikon) and organized in Photoshop and Illustrator (Adobe). The images shown in Fig. S3 A are 3D reconstitutions using NIS-Elements with the maximum projection blending option. FRAP experiments were performed as described previously ([bib17]; [bib68]) and conform to common membrane protein FRAP methodology ([bib56]; [bib16]; [bib47]; [bib70]; [bib37]). The FRAP conditions as described as follows were identical for all experiments. In brief, a laser-scanning confocal microscope (510 Axiovert; Carl Zeiss) was used. Leaf sections of either transiently transformed N. benthamiana ([fig5]) or stably transformed A. thaliana plants ([fig9] and Fig. S4 C) were either directly mounted or first treated with 25 µM LatB for 30 min (or mock treated) before mounting. The 488-nm argon laser was used to excite GFP. For scanning, the laser transmission was kept below 5%, and for bleaching, it was used at 100%. The 63× oil immersion objective (numerical aperture 1.4) and a digital zoom factor of 2 were applied. Two differently sized regions of interest (ROIs) were used depending on nuclear size—for all FRAP experiments of N. benthamiana leaf epidermal cell nuclei, the ROI was always 51 µm2, and for all FRAP experiments of A. thaliana leaf guard cell nuclei, the ROI was always 19 µm2. For each sample, 35 nuclei were investigated. Fluorescent intensity in the ROI was observed—5 prebleach and 35 postbleach measurements were collected using the LSM browser (Carl Zeiss). For the bleach itself, approximately five iterations of the 100% 488-nm laser were used, which resulted in a 23–36% decrease of GFP fluorescence. Raw data were normalized onto a percentage scale using the equation IN = (IT − IMIN)/(IMAX − IMIN) × 100, in which IN is normalized fluorescence intensity, IMIN is fluorescence intensity immediately after the bleach, and IMAX is the mean prebleach fluorescence. Normalization was used to allow comparison and analysis of each individual FRAP experiment, as NE fluorescence is variable in both transiently and stably transformed cells. For each sample, the normalized data were fitted to an exponential equation of best fit using Prism 4 (GraphPad Software), and half-time and maximum recovery were calculated. Statistical analysis was performed in Excel (Microsoft). The FRAP raw data are shown in Fig. S5. Leaves of 20-d-old A. thaliana plants were ground in liquid nitrogen, and total RNA was extracted using RNeasy Plant Mini kit (QIAGEN). First-strand cDNA was synthesized using SuperScript III First-Strand Synthesis System (Life Technologies) and oligo-dT as a primer. Primers used for PCR were listed in Table S2. A. thaliana seedlings were immersed in the GUS staining solution (0.1 M sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, 10 mM EDTA, 0.1% [vol/vol] Triton X-100, 1 mM K3Fe(CN)6, and 2 mM X-Gluc [GoldBio]), vacuum infiltrated for 20 min, and incubated at 37°C for 3 h. Staining solution was then removed, and the seedlings were washed with several changes of 50% ethanol until the tissue was cleared. Seedlings were imaged under a dissecting microscope (C-LEDS; Nikon) or compound microscope (E100; Nikon) with a 10× lens (numerical aperture of 0.25) using water as a medium at room temperature. A camera (Omni ViD; OmniVision) was used to capture images, which were organized in Photoshop and Illustrator (Adobe). Leaves of 4–6-wk-old A. thaliana plants were used for the nuclear position measurement in guard cells. To open stomata, newly fully expanded leaves were detached, put on a piece of wet filter paper in a Petri dish, and irradiated with 100 µmol/m2/s of blue light for 3 h. The lower epidermis was then peeled off and fixed and stained in 4% paraformaldehyde PBS buffer (137 mM NaCl, 2.7 mM KCl, 10 mM Na2HPO4, and 2 mM KH2PO4, pH 7.4) containing 4 µM Hoechst 33342 for ≥20 min. After this fixation and staining, the leaves were imaged using a digital camera (DS-Qi1Mc; Nikon). Leaves without blue light treatment were fixed, stained, and imaged in the same way, except for the SINE1pro::GFP-SINE1 transformed sine1-1 lines, which were imaged directly on a confocal microscope (C90i; Nikon) using the fluorescence from GFP-SINE1. NIS-Elements software was used for the nuclear position measurement. An ellipse was first rendered on a pair of guard cells using the five-point ellipse tool. The major axis of the ellipse was aligned to the common boundary of the two guard cells. If the major axis was equal to or longer than 8 µm, the angles between the minor axis and the middle of the nuclei were measured using the free angle tool. A. thaliana seedlings were grown as described by [bib11]. 10-d-old seedlings were sprayed with 3 × 105 spores/ml Hpa isolate Noco2 until the leaf surface was completely covered with spore solution. After infection, seedlings were kept for 6 d under a sealed transparent lid to maintain high humidity (∼90–100%) at 17°C and 10/14-h day/night cycles. To quantify conidiophores, 40 seedlings per genotype were submerged in a solution of 0.1% Uvitex 2B (Polysciences, Inc.) followed by a wash in a 10× higher volume of water. Conidiophores emerging from the adaxial cotyledon side were counted using a fluorescent stereomicroscope (M165 FC; Leica) with a UV filter (Leica).
