!~ABS~! Exocyst-positive organelle (EXPO) is a double-membrane organelle mediating unconventional protein secretion in plants. The Arabidopsis exocyst subunit AtExo70E2 is essential for the recruitment of other exocyst subunits to EXPO and plays a key role in EXPO formation in both plant and animal cells.
!~RES~! When transiently expressed in Arabidopsis protoplasts both green fluorescent protein (GFP)– and red fluorescent protein (RFP)–tagged versions of AtExo70E2 localize as discrete punctae at the plasma membrane and in the cytoplasm. Coexpression of both tagged versions produces completely overlapping signals for GFP and RFP (Supplemental Figure S1). As previously described, we interpret the fluorescent punctae as representing EXPO ([B55]et al., 2010b; [B10]et al., 2012). Using the protoplast transient expression system, we therefore assayed for the ability of other Arabidopsis exocyst subunits to be recruited to EXPO. We expressed these subunits either singly or together with Exo70E2. In single expression, fluorescently tagged Sec5a, Sec6, Sec8, and Sec10 all gave rise to diffuse signals throughout the cytoplasm ([F1]). However, when coexpressed with Exo70E2, all were corecruited with Exo70E2 to the EXPO sites ([F1]). The same result was obtained with Sec3a and Sec15b (Supplemental Figure S2). That the recruitment of Exo70E2 serves as a nucleus for the recruitment of other exocyst subunits was underlined by triple-expression experiments. These showed perfect colocalization of fluorescent punctae when Exo70E2 was expressed together with Sec6 and Sec8 ([F2]) or with Sec6 and Sec10 ([F2]). Recruitment of Sec exocyst subunit proteins to Exo70E2-positive organelles (EXPOs) by Exo70E2. When expressed individually in Arabidopsis protoplasts, GFP/YFP-tagged Sec exocyst proteins give rise to a cytosolic pattern. However, after coelectroporation as indicated, the different Sec exocyst proteins show in addition a punctate pattern and are colocalized with fluorescent protein–tagged Exo70E2. Bar, 20 μm. Multiple recruitment of Sec exocyst proteins to the same EXPO by Exo70E2. Arabidopsis protoplasts were coelectroporated with fluorescent protein–tagged Exo70E2 and different Sec exocyst proteins as indicated. After 13–16 h of expression, the protoplasts were observed in a CLSM. Bar, 20 μm. We performed single and coexpression experiments with Exo70E2 and a number of other Exo70 subunits. Of these, GFP-tagged Exo70A1 and Exo70B1 gave rise to punctate signals in addition to a diffuse cytosolic background. Nevertheless, positive corecruitment with Exo70E2 was observed with these two Exo70 paralogues ([F3]). In contrast, both Exo70E1 and Exo70H1 produced only diffuse cytosolic signals but did recruit to EXPO when expressed together with Exo70E2 ([F3]). Such corecruitment phenomena can also be seen with some other Exo70 paralogues (Supplemental Figure S3). Exo70 paralogues that produced only diffuse cytosolic signals and failed to be recruited to EXPO by coexpression with Exo70E2 were Exo70A3 ([F4]), Exo70C1 ([F4]), Exo70D1, D2, and D3 ([F4]; Supplemental Figure S4, a–h), Exo70F1 ([F4]), and Exo70H2, H4, H6, and H8 (Supplemental Figure S4, i–x). Exo84c also did not corecruit with Exo70E2 but nevertheless did give rise to fluorescent punctae (Supplemental Figure S5, a–d). Some Exo70 exocyst proteins can be recruited to EXPO by Exo70E2. When expressed individually in Arabidopsis protoplasts, different Exo70 proteins gave strong cytosolic patterns. After coelectroporation with fluorescent protein–tagged Exo70E2 as indicated, these proteins show a punctate pattern and are colocalized with Exo70E2. Bar, 20 μm. Other Exo70 exocyst proteins do not show EXPO recruitment with Exo70E2. Whether singly expressed or coexpressed with Exo70E2-mRFP in Arabidopsis protoplasts, a number of other Exo70 exocyst proteins give rise to only cytosolic patterns. Bar, 20 μm. To counteract the argument that the transient expression of Exo70E2 is artifactual through the use of the 35S promoter, we generated an Exo70E2-GFP construct under the control of the native Exo70E2 promoter. As seen in [F5], a similar density of overlapping fluorescent punctae for Sec6 and Exo70E2 was obtained with the native promoter as previously seen with the 35S promoter (compare with [F1]). Sec6 can also be recruited to EXPO by Exo70E2 driven by Exo70E2 native promoter. Whether coexpressed with Exo70E2-GFP driven by Exo70E2 native promoter in Arabidopsis protoplasts, Sec6-mRFP shows a punctate pattern and is colocalized with Exo70E2. Bar, 20 μm. In addition to Exo70E2, we tested one of the other Arabidopsis Exo70 paralogues in terms of its ability to corecruit other exocyst subunits. Although, as mentioned, Exo70A1-GFP gave rise to fluorescent punctae, these did not lead to a corecruitment of Sec6, Sec8, or Sec10 when coexpressed ([F6]). Instead, the signals for Sec6, Sec8, and Sec10 remained diffuse and cytosolic. Exo70A1 cannot recruit Sec exocyst proteins to EXPO. Various Sec exocyst proteins remain cytosolic even when coexpressed with Exo70A1-GFP in Arabidopsis protoplasts, even though Exo70A1-GFP itself produces fluorescent punctae. Bar, 20 μm. Because colocalization of fluorescence signals is an indicator but not proof of molecular interactions between two partners in a complex, we performed both fluorescence resonance energy transfer assay (FRET) and bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) on the putative interactions between Exo70E2 and other exocyst members. For the FRET analysis, protoplasts were observed in the confocal laser scanning microscope (CLSM) after ∼15 h of coexpression of the two fluorescent constructs and subjected to spectral FRET analysis. As can be seen from [F7], we selected for this analysis two colocalizing fluorescent punctae. In each case there was a high degree shifting of fluorescence signal intensity from the emission peak of cyan fluorescent protein (CFP) to the emission peak of yellow fluorescent protein (YFP), which is a positive indicator of protein–protein interaction ([B46]et al., 2001). For the BiFC analysis, positive fluorescence signals were obtained after coexpression of the different exocyst partners when tagged with the split BiFC constructs YC and YN ([F7]). As controls, we performed transient expressions with different combinations of the individual exocyst subunit with one or the other free BiFC reagent (Supplemental Figure S6, a–i). Although different Sec proteins can be positively recruited by Exo70E2 ([F1] and Supplemental Figure S1), not all of them can directly interact with Exo70E2 ([T1]). Of interest, some of them behaved as bridges between Exo70E2 and other exocyst members ([T1]). Visualization of protein–protein interactions between different exocyst subunits and Exo70E2 by spectral-FRET and BiFC. (A) Arabidopsis protoplasts were coelectroporated with different combinations of fusion protein constructs as indicated in a–c and e–g. After 13–16 h of expression, the protoplasts were observed in a CLSM and analyzed with spectral-FRET (d, h). (B) Epifluorescence images (i, k) and overlay images (j, l) with bright-field images from Arabidopsis protoplasts coexpressing different combinations of BiFC constructs as indicated. Bar, 20 μm. Interaction network of different exocyst subunits in plant cells. Bold, data from FRET analysis; not bold, data from BiFC assay. We introduced AtExo70E2 into cultured human embryo kidney cells (HEK293A cell line) in an attempt to see whether an EXPO-like structure could be induced by its overexpression. As detailed in Supplemental Figure S7, full-length AtExo70E2-GFP can be successfully expressed in HEK293A cells, its presence being detectable by both GFP and E2 antibodies in Western blots of total cell extracts. When transiently expressed in HEK cells, AtExo70E2-GFP showed a punctate distribution ([F8]). Of interest, overexpression of human Exo70-GFP in HEK cells also gave rise to large fluorescent punctae, although fewer in number ([F8]). However, when coexpressed with AtExo70E2-mRFP, there was no overlap with the punctate human Exo70-GFP signals ([F8]). We also expressed yeast Exo70-GFP in HEK cells but only observed a diffuse cytosolic fluorescence ([F8]). Overexpression of AtExo70E2-GFP also leads to the formation of EXPO-like structures in mammalian HEK293A cells. (A) When transiently expressed in HEK293A cells, AtExo70E2-GFP shows a punctate pattern (a). HEK293A cells transfected with free GFP (c) is included as control. (b, d) Merged differential interference contrast images. In contrast, human Exo70 labels the plasma membrane and cytosolic punctae (e), and yeast Exo70 shows only a cytosolic pattern (g). (B) Whether singly expressed or coexpressed with Exo70E2-mRFP in Arabidopsis protoplasts, human Exo70 (m, q, and s) or yeast Exo70 (o, u, and w) produces only cytosolic patterns. Bar, 20 μm. To determine whether nonplant Exo70 homologues could induce EXPO in Arabidopsis protoplasts, we performed the appropriate heterologous transient expression experiments both in the presence and the absence of AtExo70E2. Neither when expressed singly ([F8]) nor when coexpressed together with AtExo70E2 ([F8]) was EXPO formed from the nonplant Exo70 homologues, although punctate fluorescent AtExo70E2 signals were still produced. We performed immunofluorescence with antibodies directed against a number of standard organelle markers on HEK cells expressing AtExo70E2-GFP. The fluorescent punctae obtained did not overlap with any standard organelle markers for early endosomes ([F9]), the Golgi apparatus ([F9]), late endosomes or lysosomes ([F9]), or autophagosomes ([F10]). EXPO-like structures are distinct from conventional organelles in mammalian HEK293A cells. Immunofluorescence with standard organelle marker antibodies demonstrates that AtExo70E2-GFP–positive structures do not lie on the secretory or endocytic pathways. EE, early endosome; LE, late endosome. Bar, 20 μm. EXPO-like structures are distinct from autophagosomes at different conditions in mammalian HEK293A cells. Immunofluorescence with autophagosome marker antibody anti-ATG9a demonstrates that AtExo70E2-GFP–positive organelles are different from autophagosomes with (e–h) or without (a–d) starvation treatment. Bar, 20 μm. EXPOs present in wild-type BY-2 cells, and also in wild-type Arabidopsis root cells, have two boundary membranes ([F11]; see also images in Wang et al., 2010; [B10]et al., 2012). When captured in the process of fusing with the PM, they show continuity between the outer membrane and the PM, leaving a single membrane-bordered structure containing cytosol and ribosomes in the apoplast/cell wall ([F11]). Thin sections cut from cryofixed/freeze-substituted HEK cells expressing AtExo70E2 also reveal the presence of double-membraned, EXPO-like structures ([F11]). EXPO-like membrane structures were not found in control, nontransfected HEK cells. Ultrastructure of EXPO-like structures in plant cells or HEK293A cells stably expressing AtExo70E2-GFP. (A) Examples of EXPO-like structures in transgenic tobacco BY-2 cell expressing AtExo70E2-GFP (a), Arabidopsis wild-type root cell (b), and protein patch in transgenic Arabidopsis cell expressing AtExo70E2-GFP (c). (B) Profiles of EXPO-like structures in the cytoplasm from sections cut from high-pressure frozen/freeze-substituted samples of HEK293A cells expressing AtExo70E2-GFP (d–i). (f) Immunogold labeling with GFP antibodies; (g, h, and i) immunogold labeling with AtExo70E2 antibodies. Bars, 500 nm. To confirm the identity of these structures as EXPOs, we performed immunogold labeling on HEK cells expressing AtExo70E2-GFP with both GFP and AtExo70E2 antibodies. With the GFP antibodies we obtained clusters of gold particles at the PM ([F11]), which resembled closely the images seen when immunogold electron microscopy was performed with AtExo70E2 antibodies for EXPO fusion in plant cells ([F11]; also see Figure 10 in Wang et al., 2010). In addition, AtExo70E2 antibodies labeled the membrane of the EXPO-like structures ([F11]).
!~MM~! Different constructs of Exo70A1/B1/B2/D1/D2/E1/E2/F1 were generated as previously described ([B55]et al., 2010b). Full-length cDNAs of other exocyst subunits were amplified from Arabidopsis Columbia-0 leaf tissue cDNA with the primer sets listed in Supplemental Table S2. The amplified fragments were cloned into the pBI221 vector with different fluorescent tags at the N-terminus or C-terminus using specific restriction cutting sites to generate the various fusion constructs under the cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter and the nopaline synthase terminator. cDNAs coding for full-length Arabidopsis Exo70E2, yeast Exo70p, or human Exo70 were amplified from Arabidopsis Columbia-0 leaf tissue cDNA, the genomic DNA of budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae BY 4743, or cDNA from human HEK293A culture cells with different primer sets listed in Supplemental Table S2. The amplified fragments were then cloned into pBI221, pEGFP-N1/C1 (Clontech, Mountain View, CA) or pDsRed-N1 (Clontech), respectively. For the Exo70E2 promoter::Exo70E2-GFP construct, the Exo70E2 promoter sequence was amplified as previously described ([B34]et al., 2010) by using the primer set listed in Supplemental Table S2. The PCR fragment was digested with ClaI/BamHI and then ligated into the premade pBI121 vector containing the Exo70E2-GFP coding sequence described previously ([B55]et al., 2010b) to replace the cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter. Procedures for maintaining Arabidopsis suspension cultured cells were as described previously ([B36]). Transient expression using Arabidopsis protoplasts was been done essentially as in a previously established protocol ([B36]). HEK293A cells were propagated in DMEM containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (Invitrogen, Grand Island, NY) and 1% penicillin and streptomycin in 75-cm2 flasks under 5% CO2 at 37°C. For transfection, HEK293A cells were cultured in six-well plates and transfected with plasmids using jetPEI transfection reagent (PolyPlus, New York, NY). Twenty-four hours after transfection, cells were washed in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for immunolabeling and confocal imaging. Transfection of linearized AtExo70E2-GFP plasmid was carried out in 24-well tissue culture plates containing 50,000 cells using jetPEI transfection reagent. The medium was replaced 24 h after transfection by DMEM supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum and 1% penicillin and streptomycin. At 48 h after transfection, cells were fed with selective medium containing 1 mg/ml Geneticin. Then cells were fed with fresh medium every day and passaged upon reaching confluence by trypsinization. Cells were selected for at least 14 d before proceeding to cloning by limited dilution. To isolate monoclonal cell lines with highest AtExo70E2-GFP expression, cells were subcloned by seeding 50, 100, and 200 cells into three separate 96-well tissue culture plates and maintained in selective medium supplemented with 500 μg/ml Geneticin. After 1 wk, cells were trypsinized and passed to another 96-well plate, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, and examined under a fluorescence microscope. Subclones that gave good AtExo70E2 expression were frozen and proceeded to other rounds of subcloning until single-cell subclones that gave good AtExo70E2 expression were obtained. Fixation and preparation of AtExo70E2GFP-transformed HEK293A cells and their labeling and analysis by confocal immunofluorescence were described previously ([B24]; [B23]et al., 2000; [B37]et al., 2008, [B38]; [B57]et al., 2010a; [B16]et al., 2012). HEK293A cells were seeded on coverslip in six-well culture plates. Cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min in room temperature, followed by methanol fixation for 5 min at −20°C. After blocking with 1% bovine serum albumin diluted in 1× PBS for 1 h at room temperature, primary antibody was added with different concentrations, and slides were incubated overnight at 4°C. Slides were then washed with 1× PBS three times, incubated with secondary antibodies at room temperature for 1 h, washed with 1× PBS three times, and subjected to confocal laser scanning microscopy. Confocal fluorescence images were collected using an Olympus FluoView FV1000 confocal microscope (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) with a 60× water lens. The settings for collecting confocal images and processing of images using Photoshop (Adobe, San Jose, CA) were as described previously ([B4]et al., 2011; [B47]et al., 2013). Starvation of HEK293A transgenic cells to induce autophagy was performed as previously described ([B41]; [B35]et al., 2006). Generally, the normal cultured cells were washed three times with PBS and then incubated in Earle's balanced salts solution at 37°C for 2 h to induce autophagosome formation. The general procedures for transmission electron microscopy, sample preparation, and thin sectioning of resin blocks of AtExo70E2GFP-transformed HEK293A cells were performed essentially as described previously ([B53]et al., 2004; [B30]et al., 2007, [B29]). For high-pressure freezing, AtExo70E2GFP-transformed HEK293A cells were harvested by trypsinization, gently spin down, and immediately frozen in a high-pressure freezing apparatus (EM Part2; Leica, Wetzlar, Germany). Immunolabeling on HM20 sections was done using standard procedures as described previously ([B53]et al., 2004) with Exo70E2 antibodies or GFP antibodies and gold-coupled secondary antibodies. Sections were poststained with aqueous uranyl acetate/lead citrate and then examined with a Hitachi H7650 transmission electron microscope (Hitachi, Tokyo, Japan) with a MacroFire monochrome charge-coupled device camera (Optronics) operating at 80 kV as described previously ([B53]et al., 2004; [B56]et al., 2007; [B65]et al., 2013). FRET assays were performed essentially as previously described, with minor modifications ([B46]et al., 2001; [B48]et al., 2008). Arabidopsis protoplasts were coelectroporated with different combinations of fusion proteins. After incubating for 13 h, fluorescence images were taken using a confocal laser scanning microscope (TCS SP5 II; Leica, Japan). The fluorescence of CFP was detected at 470–500 nm and that of YFP at 530–550 nm. Fluorescence resonance energy transfer was performed by a donor-acceptor spectral shift assay. The transfected Arabidopsis protoplasts were excited using a 458-nm laser, and emission fluorescence was monitored between 465 and 600 nm. Image acquisition was performed by a Leica LSM 5 image browser and analyzed by Origin 8.0 (OriginLab, Northampton, MA). The general procedures of BiFC were basically as previously described ([B54]et al., 2008). Arabidopsis protoplasts were coelectroporated with different combinations of fusion proteins with split YFP. Fluorescence images were taken using a confocal laser scanning microscope (Olympus FluoView FV1000). Proteins were isolated from different HEK293A cells and fractionated on 10% SDS–PAGE, followed by Western blotting as previously described ([B5]et al., 2012). Sequence data for different genes can be found in the Tair/GenBank/EMBL data libraries under the accession numbers listed in Supplemental Table S1.
