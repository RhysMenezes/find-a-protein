!~ABS~! Plant hormone abscisic acid (ABA) plays a crucial role in modulating plant responses to environmental stresses. Basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factors are one of the largest transcription factor families that regulate multiple aspects of plant growth and development, as well as of plant metabolism in Arabidopsis. Several bHLH transcription factors have been shown to be involved in the regulation of ABA signaling. We report here the characterization of bHLH129, a bHLH transcription factor in Arabidopsis. We found that the expression level of bHLH129 was reduced in response to exogenously applied ABA, and elevated in the ABA biosynthesis mutant aba1-5. Florescence observation of transgenic plants expressing bHLH129-GFP showed that bHLH129 was localized in the nucleus, and transient expression of bHLH129 in protoplasts inhibited reporter gene expression. When expressed in Arabidopsis under the control of the 35S promoter, bHLH129 promoted root elongation, and the transgenic plants were less sensitivity to ABA in root elongation assays. Quantitative RT-PCR results showed that ABA response of several genes involved in ABA signaling, including ABI1, SnRK2.2, SnRK2.3 and SnRK2.6 were altered in the transgenic plants overexpressing bHLH129. Taken together, our study suggests that bHLH129 is a transcription repressor that negatively regulates ABA response in Arabidopsis.
!~RES~! Arabidopsis bHLH transcription factors have been shown to regulate plant metabolism, as well as multiple aspects of plant growth and development[b2]. Several bHLH transcription factors are reported to regulate ABA response[b25][b28][b29][b30]. Our previously microarray data showed that expression of bHLH129 (At2g43140) is regulated by ABA[b32], suggesting that bHLH129 may involve in the regulation of ABA response. To investigate the possible roles of bHLH129 in ABA response in Arabidopsis, we examined if the expression of bHLH129 is regulated by ABA. We first examined if ABA treatment will affect the expression of bHLH129. Arabidopsis seedlings were treated with ABA for 3 h, RNA was isolated and RT-PCR or quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) was used to examine the expression of bHLH129. As shown in [f1], expression level of bHLH129 in Arabidopsis seedlings was dramatically reduced in response to exogenously applied ABA. Quantitative RT-PCR results showed that transcript levels of bHLH129 were decreased about 60-fold and 4-fold, respectively after ABA and 2,4-epibrassinolide treatments, but remained largely unchanged after methyl jasmonate treatment ([f1]). We then examined if expression of bHLH129 is altered in aba1-5 ([f1]), an ABA biosynthesis mutant[b33]. We found that the transcript levels of bHLH129 increased ~1.4-fold in the aba1-5 mutant seedlings. These results suggest that bHLH129 is an ABA response gene and its expression is down-regulated by ABA. To examine the expression patterns of bHLH129, different tissues and organs were collected from Arabidopsis seedlings and mature plants, and RT-PCR was used to examine the expression of bHLH129 in the samples collected. We found that transcripts of bHLH129 were detectable in all tissues and organs examined but stems, with relative higher expression levels detected in roots and cotyledons ([f2]). To examine the expression patterns of bHLH129 in more details, we generated reporter transgenic plants by transforming wild-type plants with bHLH129p:GUS construct, and examined GUS expression in the transgenic plants. We found that, consistent with the RT-PCR results, bHLH129p:GUS was highly expressed in the roots and cotyledons, but not stems ([f2]). Higher expression level of bHLH129p:GUS was also observed in hypocotyls and some flower organs ([f2]). We also found that bHLH129p:GUS was expressed in young rosette leaves and the lower part of young siliques, but not mature rosette leaves and old siliques ([f2]), suggesting that expression of bHLH129p:GUS appears to be developmentally regulated. Some bHLH transcription factors such as GL3, AtbHLH112 and AtMYC2 have been shown to be transcription activators[b30][b34], whereas some others such as JASMONATE-ASSOCIATED MYC2-LIKE1 (JAM1), JAM2 and JAM3 are repressors[b35][b36]. To explore bHLH129’s functions in Arabidopsis, we decided to examine if bHLH129 functions as transcription activator or repressor. We first examined bHLH129’s subcellular localization by generating bHLH129-GFP transgenic plants and examining GFP florescence in the transgenic plants. The bHLH129-GFP transgenic plant seedlings have longer primary root when compared with that in Col wild type seedlings ([f3]), a phenotype similar to that of the bHLH129 transgenic plants (see next section for details), suggesting that the bHLH129-GFP was functional. By examining GFP florescence in the root of the bHLH129-GFP transgenic plant seedlings obtained, we found that bHLH129 is predominantly localized in the nucleus ([f3]). We then examined transcriptional activities of bHLH129 using protoplast transient transfection assays. Plasmids of activator gene LD-VP, effector gene GD-bHLH129 or control gene GD, and the reporter gene LexA-Gal4:GUS were co-transfected into protoplasts, and GUS activities were measured after incubation of the transfected protoplasts overnight at darkness. In this system, the LD-VP activator can be recruited to the LexA DNA binding site thus activating the reporter gene, whereas GD control or GD-bHLH129 can be recruited to the Gal4 DNA binding site of the reporter gene. If bHLH129 functions as a transcription repressor, co-transfection of GD-bHLH129 will result in repression of the reporter gene activated by LD-VP. As shown in [f4], co-transfection of the activator gene LD-VP and the control gene GD activated the reporter gene, while co-transfection of the effector gene GD-bHLH129 resulted in repression of the reporter gene, indicating that bHLH129 is a transcription repressor. Having shown that expression of bHLH129 is down-regulated by ABA ([f1]), and bHLH129 functions as a transcription repressor ([f4]), we further explored the functions of bHLH129 by generating transgenic plants expressing bHLH129 under the control of the 35S promoter (35S:bHLH129), isolating bHLH129 knock-out mutants, and examining phenotypes of the transgenic plants and the mutants obtained. Plant overexpressing bHLH129 was obtained by transforming Col wild type plants with the 35S:bHLH129 construct, and bHLH129 knock-out mutant bhlh129-1 was isolated from a SALK T-DNA insertion line (SALK_041780) obtained from ABRC. As shown in [f5], bHLH129 transgenic Arabidopsis seedlings have increased primary root length when compared with that of the wild type seedlings, whereas the primary root length of the bhlh129-1 mutant seedlings were largely indistinguishable from that of the wild type seedlings. Quantitative analysis showed that there was an ~20% increase in the primary root length of the transgenic plants ([f5]). Overexpression of bHLH129 in the transgenic plants and knock-out of bHLH129 in the bhlh129-1 mutant were confirmed by RT-PCR ([f5]). Transgenic plant seedlings expressing GFP tagged bHLH129 (35S:bHLH129-GFP) also resulted in increased primary root length ([f3]), indicating that bHLH129-GFP is functional, thus the plants were used to examine subcellular localization of bHLH129 ([f3]). Because bHLH129 is an ABA response gene ([f1]), we further examined if bHLH129 is involved in regulating ABA response by examining ABA responsiveness of the bHLH129 transgenic plants obtained. ABA inhibited root elongation was used to analyze ABA responsiveness in the transgenic plants. Four-day-old seedlings of wild-type and the bHLH129 transgenic plants grown on vertical 1/2 MS plates were transferred to new 1/2 MS plates at the presence and absence of ABA and grown vertically for additional 10 days. The primary root length was measured and percentage of root inhibition was calculated. As shown in [f6], Arabidopsis seedlings over-expressing bHLH129 was less sensitive to ABA treatments. The root elongation of wild-type seedlings was inhibited about 50% by 5 μM ABA, whereas that of bHLH129 transgenic plants was only about 30% ([f6]). Root elongation was further inhibited by 10 μM ABA, however, the bHLH129 transgenic plant seedlings were still less sensitive to ABA treatments when compared with that of the wild type seedlings ([f6]). On the other hand, a near wild type response to ABA treatments was observed with the bhlh129-1 mutant seedlings ([f6]). ABA signaling is regulated by several different types of proteins, including the central regulators PROTEIN PHOSPHATASE 2C (PP2C) A-group proteins and SUCROSE NONFERMENTING 1 (SNF1)-RELATED PROTEIN KINASES (SnRK2s)[b21][b22][b23][b24]. To investigate why the bHLH129 transgenic plants were less sensitive to ABA treatment when compared to the Col wild type, we examined the expression of some ABA signaling regulator genes including PP2C genes and SnRK2 genes in the bHLH129 transgenic plants. As shown in [f7], the expression levels of SnRK2 gene SnRK2.2, SnRK2.3 and SnRK2.6, and PP2C gene ABA INSENSITIVE 1 (ABI1) in the transgenic plant seedlings were largely unaffected. When compared to that in the Col wild type plant seedlings, however, their response to ABA was altered in the transgenic plants overexpressing bHLH129 ([f7]). An ~2–5 folds induction of the above mentioned genes in response to ABA was observed in the Col wild type seedlings ([f7]). In the bHLH129 transgenic seedlings, the expression of SnRK2.2 and SnRK2.3 was no longer induced by ABA treatment. On the other hand, expression levels of SnRK2.6 in response to ABA in the transgenic plant seedlings was reduced to about two-third of that in the wild type seedlings, whereas the expression levels of ABI1 was increased about 4 folds ([f7]).
!~MM~! Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) ecotype Columbia (Col-0) was used for plant transformation and protoplasts isolation. The bhlh129-1 mutant was isolated from a SALK T-DNA insertion line (SALK_041780) obtained from ABRC. To obtain seedlings for phenotypic analysis and ABA treatment, Arabidopsis seeds were sterilized and sown on ½ MS (Murashige & Skoog) plates with vitamins (PlantMedia) and 1% (w/v) sucrose, solidified with 0.6% (w/v) phytoagar (PlantMedia). The plates were kept at 4 °C in darkness for 2 days before moved into a growth room. To obtain plants for plant transformation and protoplasts isolation, Arabidopsis seeds were sown directly into soil pots and kept in a growth room. The growth condition in the growth room was set with a temperature at 22 °C and a photoperiod with 16 h/8 h (light/dark) at a light density of approximately 120 μmol m−2s−1. To examine the expression of bHLH129 and genes involved in ABA signaling in response to ABA, 12-day-old Col wild type seedlings were treated with 10 μM ABA, 200 nM methyl jasmonate, or 100 nM 2,4-epibrassinolide for 3 h in darkness on a shaker at 40 rpm. Samples were frozen in liquid N2 and kept at −80 °C for RNA isolation. To examine ABA sensitivity of the bHLH129 transgenic plant seedlings, 4-day-old Col wild type and bHLH129 transgenic plant seedlings grown on vertical plates were transferred into new plates containing either 5 μM or 10 μM ABA and grown vertically. Pictures were taken 10 days after transfer, root length was measured using Image J software, and percentage of inhibition was calculated. The experiments were repeated three times, and data from a representative experiment was presented. DNA and total RNA from Arabidopsis seedlings were isolated as described previously[b9][b38][b39][b40]. cDNA was synthesized using 2 μg total RNA by Oligo(dT)-primed reverse transcription using the EazyScript First-Strand DNA Synthesis Super Mix (TransGen Biotech). RT-PCR was used to examine the expression of bHLH129, qRT-PCR was used to examine the expression of bHLH129 and genes involved in ABA signaling pathway. Arabidopsis gene ACTIN2 (ACT2) was used as a control for RT-PCR and qRT-PCR. Primers used for RT-PCR and qRT-PCR analysis of bHLH129 and genes involved in ABA signaling pathway are: bHLH129, 5′-TTTCTCTAGGACGGCCAAAC-3′ and 5′-GATGGCTACTACTCCCACTAGA-3′, SnRK2.2, 5′-CCGATTATGCACGACAGTGA-3′ and 5′-CAAGCTCCTTGGTGACTCTATC-3′, SnRK2.3, 5′-GAAGATCCAGAAGAGCCAAGAG-3′ and 5′-CCGTATGTCATCAGGGATTGAG-3′, SnRK2.6, 5′-CGGGCCAAAGCATAGAAGAA-3′ and 5′-CCAAGCTTCCTGTGAGGTAATG-3′. The primers for qRT-PCR examination of ABI1, and for RT-PCR and qRT-PCR examination of ACT2 have been described previously[b9][b40][b41]. The reporter construct LexA-Gal4:GUS, and effector constructs GD and LD-VP used for protoplast transfection have been described previously[b42][b43]. To generate GD tagged bHLH129 construct for protoplast transfection assays and HA tagged bHLH129 construct for plant transformation, the full-length open-reading frame (ORF) of bHLH129 was amplified by RT-PCR using RNA isolated from the Arabidopsis seedlings, and cloned in frame with an N-terminal GD or HA tag into the pUC19 vector under the control of the 35S promoter[b44][b45]. HA tagged bHLH129 construct in pUC19 was then digested with proper enzymes, and subcloned into the binary vector pPZP211[b46]. To generate GFP tagged construct for subcellular localization analysis of bHLH129, the ORF of bHLH129 was amplified and cloned in frame with a C-terminal GFP tag into the pUC19, the construct obtained was then digested with proper enzymes, and subcloned into the binary vector pPZP211 for plant transformation. To generate bHLH129p:GUS (β-glucuronidase) construct for plant transformation, a 2514 bp DNA fragment immediately before the start condon of bHLH129 was amplified by PCR using DNA isolated from Arabidopsis seedlings, and used to replace the OFP1 promoter in the pPZP211OFP1p:GUS construct[b43]. The primers used to generate GD/HA-bHLH129 construct are 5′-CAACATATGTACCCTCCTAATTCCTC-3′ and 5′-CAAGAGCTCTCATCGCTTCTTGCATGC-3′, the primers used to generate bHLH129-GFP construct are 5′-CAACATATGTACCCTCCTAATTCCTC-3′ and 5′-CAAGAGCTCTCGCTTCTTGCATGC-3′, and the primers used for make bHLH129p:GUS construct are 5′-CAACTGCAGCATGATCGGTCTGATTC-3′ and 5′-CAAGAGCTCGAAACCGGAAAAGAAAAACCC-3′. About 5-week-old plants with several mature flowers on the main inflorescence were used for transformation by using the floral dip method[b47]. Transgenic plants were selected by grown T1 seeds on 1/2 MS plates containing 50 μg/ml kanamycin and 100 μg/ml carbenicillin. For each construct, at least 5 transgenic lines with similar phenotypes were obtained, and represent homozygous T3 or T4 plants were used for further analysis. Plasmids preparation, protoplasts isolation, transfection and GUS activity assay were performed as described previously[b9][b39][b40][b43][b44][b45][b48]. In brief, reporter and effector plasmid DNA were isolated using the GoldHi EndoFree Plasmid Maxi Kit (CWbiotech), and co-transfected into protoplasts isolated from rosette leaves collected from ~4-week-old wild type Arabidopsis plants. Transfected protoplasts were incubated under darkness at room temperature for 20–22 h, and then GUS activities were measured by using a SynergyTM HT microplate reader (BioTEK). GUS activity was monitored by staining seedlings and different organs of adult bHLH129p:GUS transgenic Arabidopsis plants with X-gluc (5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-D-glucuronide, Rose Scientific Ltd.) using the procedure described previously[b49]. Photographs of Col wild type and transgenic Arabidopsis seedlings were taken under a Motic K dissection microscope equipped with an EOS 1100D camera. GFP florescence of bHLH129-GFP transgenic seedlings was examined, and photographs were taken under an Olympus FV1000 confocal microscope.
