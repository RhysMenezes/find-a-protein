!~ABS~! Bacterial pathogens of plant and animals share a homologous group of virulence factors, referred to as the YopJ effector family, which are translocated by the type III secretion (T3S) system into host cells during infection. Recent work indicates that some of these effectors encode acetyltransferases that suppress host immunity. The YopJ-like protein AvrBsT is known to activate effector-triggered immunity (ETI) in Arabidopsis thaliana Pi-0 plants; however, the nature of its enzymatic activity and host target(s) has remained elusive. Here we report that AvrBsT possesses acetyltransferase activity and acetylates ACIP1 (for ACETYLATED INTERACTING PROTEIN1), an unknown protein from Arabidopsis. Genetic studies revealed that Arabidopsis ACIP family members are required for both pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP)-triggered immunity and AvrBsT-triggered ETI during Pseudomonas syringae pathovar tomato DC3000 (Pst DC3000) infection. Microscopy studies revealed that ACIP1 is associated with punctae on the cell cortex and some of these punctae co-localize with microtubules. These structures were dramatically altered during infection. Pst DC3000 or Pst DC3000 AvrRpt2 infection triggered the formation of numerous, small ACIP1 punctae and rods. By contrast, Pst DC3000 AvrBsT infection primarily triggered the formation of large GFP-ACIP1 aggregates, in an acetyltransferase-dependent manner. Our data reveal that members of the ACIP family are new components of the defense machinery required for anti-bacterial immunity. They also suggest that AvrBsT-dependent acetylation in planta alters ACIP1's defense function, which is linked to the activation of ETI.
!~RES~! To identify potential AvrBsT-interacting proteins in Arabidopsis, we performed a yeast two-hybrid screen using the GAL4 DNA-binding domain (BD) fused to AvrBsT (i.e. BD-AvrBsT) and an Arabidopsis cDNA library fused to the GAL4 activation domain (AD). We screened ∼7 million primary yeast transformants and isolated 11 independent clones with a candidate cDNA encoded by At3g09980 ([ppat-1003952-g001] and [ppat.1003952.s001]). Given that AvrBsT is predicted to encode an acetyltransferase, we named the At3g09980-encoded protein ACIP1, for putative acetylated-interacting protein 1 ([ppat-1003952-g001]). (A) Yeast two-hybrid assay showing AvrBsT binding to Arabidopsis ACIP1. Yeast strain AH109 carrying pXDGATcy86 (vector) or pXDGATcy86(AvrBsT) were independently transformed with the pGADT7 (vector) or pGADT7 containing ACIP1. pXDGATcy86 contains the GAL4 DNA-binding domain (BD) and pGADT7 contains the GAL4 activation domain (AD). Strains were spotted on nonselective (SD – LW) and selective (SD –LWH +1 mM 3-AT) media and then incubated at 30°C for 3 d. (B) GST-AvrBsT affinity purification of His6-ACIP1 in vitro. GST or GST-AvrBsT was incubated with E. coli extracts containing His6-ACIP1. Proteins were purified by using glutathione sepharose and analyzed by immunoblot (IB) analysis using anti-GST and anti-His sera. Protein input is shown on left and pull-down on right. Expected protein MW: GST = 28 kDa; GST-AvrBsT = 65 kDa; and His6-ACIP1 = 28 kDa. +, protein expressed; −, vector control. STD, molecular weight standard. Similar phenotypes were observed in at least 3 independent experiments. ACIP1 is predicted to encode a protein with 178 amino acids and molecular weight of ∼20.6 kDa. ACIP1's only distinguishing feature is that it is predicted to be a small, α-helical protein [ppat.1003952-Kelley1] that contains the widely conserved domain of unknown function, DUF662 [ppat.1003952-Punta1]. It was first identified as a tubulin-binding protein [ppat.1003952-Chuong1]. ACIP1 belongs to a small Arabidopsis protein family containing six ACIP-like isoforms (ACIP-L1 to ACIP-L6, [ppat.1003952.s001]). ACIP-L4 and its wheat ortholog TaSRG are required for salt tolerance [ppat.1003952-He1], although their biochemical function(s) are not known. ACIP1 shares 79% identity and 87% similarity with ACIP-L1, the closest isoform. A tree for the Arabidopsis ACIP protein family is shown in [ppat.1003952.s001]. None of the ACIP-like isoforms were isolated in the primary AvrBsT interaction screen. A candidate yeast interaction screen comparing AvrBsT binding to ACIP1 or the six ACIP-like isoforms revealed that AvrBsT strongly interacts with ACIP1 but only weakly interacts with ACIP-L1 on selection media containing 1 mM 3-AT ([ppat.1003952.s001]). In the presence of 5 mM 3-AT, AvrBsT only interacted with ACIP1 (data not shown). Taken together, these data suggest that AvrBsT preferentially binds to ACIP1 in yeast. Next, we used GST pull-down assays to independently monitor the physical association of AvrBsT and ACIP1 in vitro. Recombinant GST and GST-AvrBsT were expressed in E. coli and then purified using glutathione sepharose. Purified GST-AvrBsT migrated as a doublet in protein gels, suggesting that proteolysis of the full-length polypeptide likely occurred during extraction and/or affinity purification. His-tagged ACIP1 was expressed in E. coli and soluble protein extracts were incubated with the GST or GST-AvrBsT in a standard GST pull-down assay. His6-ACIP1 was affinity purified by GST-AvrBsT but not GST ([ppat-1003952-g001]). These findings are in agreement with the yeast two-hybrid data and provide additional evidence that AvrBsT interacts with Arabidopsis ACIP1. We attempted to verify AvrBsT-ACIP1 physical interaction in planta; however, the assays were not successful. Transient or inducible expression of AvrBsT in Arabidopsis Pi-0 leaves or Nicotiana benthamiana leaves results in localized cell death. It was difficult to obtain reproducible, conclusive binding data under these cellular conditions. AvrBsT belongs to the YopJ family of T3S effector proteins, some of which have been shown to exhibit acetyltransferase activity [ppat.1003952-Mukherjee1], [ppat.1003952-Tasset1], [ppat.1003952-Lee1]. To ascertain if AvrBsT acetylates ACIP1, we first sought to determine if AvrBsT possesses auto-acetylation activity in vitro. Recombinant wild-type GST-AvrBsT, GST (negative control) and GST-HopZ1a (positive control) [ppat.1003952-Lee1] were over-expressed in E. coli and then purified using glutathione sepharose. Purified proteins were incubated with 14C-acetyl-coenzyme A (acetyl-CoA) ±100 nM inositol hexakisphosphate (IP6) for 30 minutes at room temperature and then separated by SDS-PAGE analysis followed by autoradiography. IP6 is a eukaryotic cofactor that stimulates the acetyltransferase activity of effectors in the YopJ family [ppat.1003952-Tasset1], [ppat.1003952-Lee1], [ppat.1003952-Mittal2]. Auto-acetylation of GST-AvrBsT was detected in the presence of IP6 but not its absence ([ppat-1003952-g002] and [ppat.1003952.s002]). As expected, similar IP6-dependent activation and auto-acetylation of GST-HopZ1a was observed, and GST was not modified ([ppat-1003952-g002] and [ppat.1003952.s002]). Mutation of the conserved catalytic Cys residue (C222) or His residue (H154) to Ala inactivated AvrBsT-dependent acetyltransferase activity but did not affect protein expression levels ([ppat-1003952-g002]). By contrast, mutation of the conserved Lys residue (K282) ([ppat.1003952.s003]) to Arg, which has been shown to be an auto-acetylation site for some effectors in the YopJ family [ppat.1003952-Tasset1], [ppat.1003952-Lee1], did not affect AvrBsT's acetylation state or protein accumulation ([ppat-1003952-g002]). The auto-acetylation activity of GST-AvrBsT(K282R) was comparable to that of wild-type GST-AvrBsT in reactions with varying concentrations of enzyme ([ppat.1003952.s003]). All GST-AvrBsT protein (wild type and mutant) analyzed migrated as a doublet and both of these species were auto-acetylated ([ppat-1003952-g002]). Taken together, these data indicate that AvrBsT possesses auto-acetylation activity in vitro that is dependent on the conserved catalytic residues H154 and C222, but this activity is independent of K282. (A) AvrBsT auto-acetylation activity in vitro. Acetylation reactions using GST and GST-AvrBsT (wild-type, C222A, H154A, and K282R) proteins. (B) AvrBsT trans-acetylates ACIP1 in vitro. Acetylation reactions using GST-ACIP1 or GST with GST-AvrBsT, GST-AvrBsT(C222A), GST-AvrBT(H154A) or GST-AvrBsT(K282R). (C) Substrate specificity of AvrBsT and HopZ1a. Acetylation reactions using GST-ACIP1 or GST with GST-HopZ1a or GST-AvrBsT. For acetylation reactions, proteins were incubated with 0.4 µCi 14C-acetyl CoA and 100 nM inositol hexakisphosphate (IP6) for 30 min at RT. Proteins were then separated by SDS-PAGE. Gels were stained with Coomassie and then analyzed by autoradiography. GST and GST-HopZ1a were used as negative and positive acetyltransferase enzyme controls, respectively. Acetylated proteins (GST-HopZ1a-AC, GST-AvrBsT-AC, and GST-ACIP1-AC) are labeled in the autoradiograph. STD, molecular weight standard in kDa. GST = 28 kDa; GST-HopZ1a = 70 kDa; GST-AvrBsT = 65 kDa; GST-ACIP1 = 50 kDa. Similar results were obtained in three independent experiments. Next, we tested if AvrBsT directly acetylates ACIP1 using similar reaction conditions to those described above. Wild-type GST-AvrBsT activity resulted in auto-acetylation of the enzyme and trans-acetylation of GST-ACIP1 ([ppat-1003952-g002]), whereas the catalytic core mutants GST-AvrBsT(C222A) or GST-AvrBsT(H154A) exhibited neither activities ([ppat-1003952-g002]). Although the GST-AvrBsT(K282R) mutant possessed auto-acetylation activity, trans-acetylation of ACIP1 was not detected under the same reaction conditions ([ppat-1003952-g002]). Importantly, mutation of C222 or K282 did not disrupt AvrBsT binding to ACIP1 in vitro ([ppat.1003952.s004]). To gain insight to the specificity of acetyltransferases in the YopJ effector family, we determined if HopZ1a could acetylate AvrBsT's substrate ACIP1. Conversely, we determined if AvrBsT could acetylate HopZ1a's substrate tubulin [ppat.1003952-Lee1]. Incubation of GST-HopZ1a with GST-ACIP1 did not result in detectable acetylation of ACIP1 ([ppat-1003952-g002]). Moreover, neither HopZ1a nor other members of the HopZ family could physically associate with ACIP1 in targeted yeast two-hybrid screens ([ppat.1003952.s005]). Similarly, we could not detect AvrBsT-dependent acetylation of tubulin in vitro ([ppat.1003952.s005]) or direct physical interaction between AvrBsT and tubulin in yeast ([ppat.1003952.s005]). These data suggest that AvrBsT and HopZ1a possess distinct substrate specificity. We assessed the biological activity of the AvrBsT(K282R) mutant in Arabidopsis Pi-0 leaves, given that mutation of the analogous Lys residue in PopP2 and HopZ1a inhibits effector auto-acetylation activity and effector-dependent phenotypes in planta [ppat.1003952-Tasset1], [ppat.1003952-Lee1]. Bacterial growth curve analyses showed that the K282R mutation attenuated the ability of AvrBsT to activate defense in Pi-0, similar to that observed for the H154A mutation in the catalytic core ([ppat-1003952-g003]). Furthermore, Pst DC3000 expressing AvrBsT(K282R) did not elicit HR in Pi-0 leaves ([ppat-1003952-g003]) despite stable protein expression ([ppat.1003952.s003]). These data indicate that the K282R mutation affects AvrBsT's trans-acetylation activity in vitro ([ppat-1003952-g002]) and its defense eliciting activity in planta ([ppat-1003952-g003]). Moreover, these data indicate that the auto-acetylation activity of AvrBsT(K282R) is not sufficient to activate ETI in Arabidopsis. (A) Growth of Pst DC3000 in Arabidopsis Pi-0 leaves. Leaves were syringe infiltrated with a 1×105 cells/mL suspension of bacteria: Pst DC3000 carrying vector (black bars), AvrBsT (white bars), AvrBsT(H154A) (dark grey bars) or AvrBsT(K282R) (light grey bars). Titers were assessed at 0 and 3 days post-inoculation. Data are mean cfu/cm2 ± SD (n = 6). Asterisks indicate statistically significant differences from Pi-0 (student's t-test, **p<0.01). Similar results were obtained in three independent experiments. (B) HR phenotypes in Pi-0 leaves. Leaves were infiltrated with a 3×108 cells/mL suspension of Pst DC3000 carrying vector, AvrBsT or AvrBsT(K282R). Photograph was taken at 12 hours post-inoculation (HPI). Number of leaves exhibiting confluent HR at 10 HPI out of 18 inoculated leaves is shown at bottom. Given that nothing was known about ACIP1 function, we first sought to elucidate its potential role in immunity. Previously we showed that the Pi-0 ecotype of Arabidopsis is resistant to Pst DC3000 expressing AvrBsT, whereas the Col-0 ecotype is susceptible [ppat.1003952-Cunnac1]. Interestingly, ACIP1 mRNA abundance was significantly reduced at 3 and 6 HPI in Pi-0 ([ppat.1003952.s006]) and Col-0 (data not shown) leaves inoculated with a 2×108 cells/mL suspension of Pst DC3000 or Pst DC3000 AvrBsT compared to leaves inoculated with mock solution of 1 mM MgCl2. By contrast, endogenous ACIP1 protein levels appeared to remain constant ([ppat.1003952.s006]). These data suggest that ACIP1 may be transcriptionally or post-transcriptionally regulated during pathogen attack and potentially linked to PTI and/or ETI. To explore this further, we first analyzed the growth of virulent Pst DC3000 in a homozygous Col-0 acip1 null mutant (SALK_028810) to determine if ACIP1 is required to limit pathogen growth. Pst DC3000 grew equally well in wild-type Col-0 and acip1 mutant leaves (data not shown). Similar results were observed when the acip1 null allele was crossed into the Pi-0 background (data not shown). We speculated that the lack of a bacterial growth phenotype in the Col-0 acip1 and Pi-0 acip1 mutants may be due to genetic redundancy since ACIP1 belongs to a small gene family in Arabidopsis ([ppat.1003952.s001],B). Since the nucleotide sequences between ACIP1 and ACIP-like genes are highly conserved ([ppat.1003952.s007]), we engineered RNAi lines to target multiple ACIP family members in attempt to uncover an immune phenotype linked to this gene family. Notably, we silenced the ACIP gene family in the Pi-0 background to be able to monitor both PTI and ETI, considering that AvrBsT induces ETI in the Pi-0 ecotype but not the Col-0 ecotype [ppat.1003952-Cunnac1]. A 365-bp hairpin ACIP binary construct (hp-ACIP) was designed using the ACIP1 gene, which included the most conserved region shared by the entire gene family ([ppat.1003952.s007],B), and then it was transformed into Pi-0 plants. Five independent transgenic RNAi lines were characterized. The hp-ACIP construct significantly reduced the mRNA levels for 4 of the 7 family members (i.e. ACIP1, ACIP-L1, ACIP-L2, and ACIP-L3) in two T2 ACIP RNAi lines (i.e. lines 1 and 29; [ppat.1003952.s007]). Of these 4 genes, ACIP1 mRNA was the most abundant transcript in 4-week old Pi-0 leaves ([ppat.1003952.s007]), suggesting that it may be the major isoform expressed in leaves. To monitor ACIP1 protein expression in leaves, we generated rabbit polyclonal antisera using recombinant ACIP1-His6 protein purified from E. coli. The resulting antisera recognized multiple, recombinant purified ACIP isoforms with distinct molecular weights by immunoblot analysis (data not shown). However in wild-type Pi-0 leaf extracts, the antisera only detected a single 20 kDa protein band ([ppat-1003952-g004], inset). Three of the isoforms have predicted molecular weights in this range: ACIP1 = 20.5 kDa, ACIP-L1 = 20.2 kDa, and ACIP-L3 = 20.9 kDa. The 20 kDa protein band was not detected in the two ACIP RNAi lines ([ppat-1003952-g004], inset) suggesting that ACIP1, ACIP-L1 and/or ACIP-L2 protein accumulation was significantly reduced. (A) Increased growth of Pst DC3000 and Pst DC3000 AvrBsT in Pi-0 ACIP RNAi line #1 (red bars) and line #29 (blue bars) compared to wild-type Pi-0 (black bars). Leaves were syringe-infiltrated with a 1×105 cells/mL suspension of bacteria. Titers were assessed at 0 and 3 days post-inoculation (DPI). Data are mean cfu/cm2 ± SD (n = 4). Asterisks indicate statistically significant differences from Pi-0 (student t-test, *p<0.05, **p<0.01). Experiment was repeated three times with similar results. Inset: Immunoblot analysis of protein extracted from Pi-0 and Pi-0 ACIP RNAi leaves using anti-ACIP1 sera. Black dot, non-specific band (NS); arrowhead, detected ∼20 kDa protein band expected to correspond to ACIP1, ACIP-L1, and/or ACIP-L3. STD, molecular weight standard in kDa. Ponceau S-stained Rubisco large subunit was used as loading control. (B) AvrBsT-elicited HR phenotype in Pi-0 and Pi-0 ACIP RNAi lines. Leaves were infiltrated with a 3×108 cells/mL suspension of Pst DC3000 alone (vector) or Pst DC3000 AvrBsT (AvrBsT). Photograph was taken at 9 hours post-inoculation (HPI). Number of leaves exhibiting confluent HR at 10 HPI out of 25 inoculated leaves is shown at right. (C) Quantification of electrolyte leakage in the leaves described in (B) at 10 HPI. Error bars represent SD (n = 10). Asterisks indicate statistically significant differences from Pi-0 (student's t-test, *p<0.05). Experiment was repeated three times with similar results. Bacterial growth curves were then performed using a 1×105 cells/mL suspension of Pst DC3000 expressing AvrBsT and the two Pi-0 ACIP RNAi transgenic lines to determine if ACIP expression is required for AvrBsT-triggered ETI. The phenotypes of the ACIP-silenced lines were compared with an unsilenced Pi-0 control plant ([ppat-1003952-g004]). We found that the titer of Pst DC3000 AvrBsT was significantly higher in infected Pi-0 ACIP RNAi leaves compared to that in wild-type Pi-0 leaves ([ppat-1003952-g004]). Notably, the Pi-0 ACIP RNAi leaves were also more susceptible to Pst DC3000. These data suggested that the silenced ACIP isoforms might function in PTI as well as ETI. To confirm that AvrBsT-triggered ETI is impaired in the RNAi lines, we performed HR and electrolyte leakage assays in leaves challenged with a high titer (3×108 cells/mL) of Pst DC3000 AvrBsT. ETI in the Pi-0 ACIP RNAi lines was delayed but not fully inhibited ([ppat-1003952-g004]). In control Pi-0 leaves, AvrBsT-dependent HR was visible at 9 HPI in many leaves and by 10 HPI, 22/25 leaves exhibited HR. By contrast, HR was not observed in similarly inoculated RNAi leaves at 9 HPI; however, HR started to develop at 10 HPI in 14/25 leaves for line 1 and 12/25 leaves for line 29. Consistent with these findings, electrolyte leakage was significantly reduced in the Pst DC3000 AvrBsT-inoculated Pi-0 ACIP RNAi leaves relative to the inoculated Pi-0 leaves at 10 HPI ([ppat-1003952-g004]). These data suggest that multiple ACIP isoforms are required for AvrBsT-triggered ETI symptoms in Pi-0. The Pi-0 ACIP RNAi lines were also examined for their ability to mount ETI in response to two other Pseudomonas effectors – AvrB and AvrRpt2 [ppat.1003952-Mackey1], [ppat.1003952-Axtell1]. As observed for AvrBsT, HR symptom development was slower in the RNAi lines infected with a high titer of Pst DC3000 AvrB or Pst DC3000 AvrRpt2 (data not shown). Subsequent bacterial growth curve analyses revealed that the Pi-0 ACIP RNAi lines were more susceptible to both Pst DC3000 AvrB and Pst DC3000 AvrRpt2 ([ppat.1003952.s008]). These data suggest that the ACIP isoforms play a general role in ETI and are not specific to defense responses elicited by AvrBsT. Given that the RNAi lines were also more susceptible to Pst DC3000, we next examined the potential role of the ACIP family in PTI. First, we analyzed the responsiveness of the Pi-0 ACIP RNAi lines to the PAMP elicitor flg22 ([ppat-1003952-g005]). Perception of flg22 by the PRR FLS2 results in the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) [ppat.1003952-GomezGomez1], one the first measurable PTI responses, followed by changes in PTI gene induction [ppat.1003952-Asai1]. Flg22-induced ROS production was significantly reduced in both Pi-0 ACIP RNAi lines ([ppat-1003952-g005]). Similarly, flg22-induced mRNA accumulation for WRKY22 and WRKY29, two genes encoding transcription factors that positively regulate PTI, was significantly reduced at 3 hr post-treatment in both Pi-0 ACIP RNAi lines ([ppat-1003952-g005]). Consistently, the RNAi line 29 exhibited the least responsiveness to flg22 elicitation ([ppat-1003952-g005]). (A) Flg22-stimulated oxidative burst response in Pi-0 and Pi-0 ACIP RNAi leaves. RLU = relative luminescence unit. Error bars represent SD (n = 9). Response in both RNAi lines (#1 and #29) was significantly different from that in Pi-0 between time interval 28–32 minutes (student's t-test, **p<0.01). (B) Flg22-stimulated PTI marker gene induction in Pi-0 and Pi-0 ACIP RNAi leaves. Leaves of three plants were infiltrated with water (control) or 100 nM flg22 and then pooled for RNA extraction. WRKY22 and WRKY29 mRNA levels were quantified by qPCR. UBQ5 was used to normalize the expression value for each sample. Relative expression (mean ± SD; n = 4) is shown. (C) Growth of Pst DC3000 ΔhrcU in Pi-0 (black bars) and Pi-0 ACIP RNAi leaves (red and blue bars). Leaves were inoculated with a 1×105 cells/mL suspension of bacteria. Titers were assessed at 0 and 4 DPI. Data are mean cfu/cm2 ± SD (n = 4). (D) Pst DC3000 ΔhrcU-stimulated PTI marker gene induction in Pi-0 and Pi-0 ACIP RNAi lines. Leaves were infiltrated with a 2×108 cells/mL suspension of Pst DC3000 (grey bar), Pst DC3000 (ΔhrcU) (black bar) or 1 mM MgCl2 (white bar). Samples were collected at 6 HPI and then analyzed as described in (B). Asterisks indicate statistically significant differences from Pi-0 (student's t-test,*p<0.05,**p<0.01, ***p<0.001). Similar results were obtained in three independent experiments for (A–C), and two independent experiments for (D). We also examined the responsiveness of the Pi-0 ACIP RNAi lines to Pst DC3000 ΔhrcU, a Pseudomonas strain known to elicit PTI. Pst DC3000 ΔhrcU lacks a functional T3S apparatus [ppat.1003952-Mudgett1] and does not suppress PTI because T3S effectors are not secreted. Leaves were infected with a 1×105 cells/mL suspension of bacteria and titers were determined at 4 DPI. Pi-0 ACIP RNAi leaves were significantly more susceptible to Pst DC3000 ΔhrcU ([ppat-1003952-g005]). Consistent with these findings, accumulation of WRKY22 and WRKY29 mRNA was significantly reduced at 6 HPI in Pi-0 ACIP RNAi leaves compared to wild-type Pi-0 leaves inoculated with a high titer (2×108 cells/mL suspension) of Pst DC3000 ΔhrcU ([ppat-1003952-g005]). Taken together, these data suggest that a subset of the ACIP family (i.e. ACIP1, ACIP-L1, ACIP-L2, and ACIP-L3) collectively contribute to anti-bacterial immunity in Arabidopsis. To begin to address ACIP1's function, we examined ACIP1 protein localization in Arabidopsis seedlings and mature plants. We generated homozygous transgenic Pi-0 plants expressing a GFP-ACIP1 protein fusion under the control of the native ACIP1 promoter (i.e. PACIP1::GFP-ACIP1). Using confocal microscopy, we observed a low level of GFP-ACIP1 fluorescence in 4-day old etiolated seedlings and juvenile leaves. Little or no detectable fluorescence was observed in mature, senescing leaves. In hypocotyl epidermal cells, GFP-ACIP1 was predominantly found as punctae at the cell cortex. A portion of these punctae was aligned, forming transverse cable-like structures ([ppat-1003952-g006]). ACIP1's subcellular localization pattern partially resembled that of cytoskeletal structures. Unlike TaSRG, the ACIP-L4 ortholog, GFP-ACIP1 was not observed in the plant nucleus, indicating that ACIP1 localization is distinct from this predicted transcription factor [ppat.1003952-He1]. (A) Single plane images of periclinal surface of epidermal cells of 4-day old etiolated Pi-0 PACIP1::GFP-ACIP1/P35S::mCHERRY-TUA5 hypocotyl cells. Arrowheads show GFP-ACIP1 punctae that are not associated with microtubules. (B) Localization of GFP-ACIP1 in 4-day old etiolated Pi-0 PACIP1::GFP-ACIP1 hypocotyls treated with MeOH or MeOH +10 µM oryzalin (top panels), or DMSO or DMSO +1 µM latrunculin B (bottom panels). Cells were imaged using confocal microscopy. Bars = 10 µm. Next, we applied drugs to disrupt the cytoskeleton to determine if ACIP1 co-localizes with actin and/or microtubules. Treatment of the Pi-0 PACIP1::GFP-ACIP1 seedlings with oryzalin, a microtubule depolymerizing agent, disrupted the GFP-ACIP1 cable-like structures and caused the formation of numerous GFP-ACIP1 punctae throughout the cell ([ppat-1003952-g006]). By contrast, the actin depolymerizing agent latrunculin B did not appear to significantly disrupt these cables ([ppat-1003952-g006]). To show ACIP co-localization with microtubules, we transformed the Pi-0 PACIP1::GFP-ACIP1 lines with P35S::mCHERRY-TUA5, a fluorescently tagged isoform of α-tubulin. A large portion of the GFP-ACIP1 punctae co-localized with mCHERRY-TUA5 microtubules ([ppat-1003952-g006]). Some of the cortical GFP-ACIP1 punctae were not associated with microtubules. Inspection of the literature revealed that ACIP1 was identified in the Arabidopsis proteome that co-purified with tubulin by affinity chromatography [ppat.1003952-Chuong1]. We did not detect a direct interaction between ACIP1 and TUA5 in a targeted yeast two-hybrid assay ([ppat.1003952.s005],B). It is possible that ACIP1 association with tubulin might be indirect or via a weak electrostatic interaction. Or, ACIP1 might interact with another isoform of tubulin. Collectively, our findings indicate that GFP-ACIP1 signal forms punctae on the cell cortex and some of these punctae co-localize with the cortical microtubule network. We speculated that AvrBsT-binding to and acetylation of ACIP1 might interfere with ACIP1's stability and/or localization within plant leaves during pathogen infection. We did not detect by protein gel blot analysis any differences in endogenous ACIP1 protein abundance or mobility using extracts isolated from Pi-0 leaves infected with Pst DC3000 or Pst DC3000 AvrBsT ([ppat.1003952.s006]). However, we did notice that GFP-ACIP1 localization in 4-week old Pi-0 PACIP1::GFP-ACIP1 leaves was dramatically altered in response to both Pst DC3000 and Pst DC3000 AvrBsT ([ppat-1003952-g007]). Unlike the signal in young hypocotyls, GFP-ACIP1 fluorescence at the cortex of epidermal cells in 4-week old leaves inoculated with the 1 mM MgCl2 mock control was diffuse and faint. This signal was difficult to capture in the image projection and varied among plants. By contrast, GFP-ACIP1 punctae were observed at or near the cell periphery of these cells ([ppat-1003952-g007]). Infection with Pst DC3000 for 6 h led to the formation of rod-shaped GFP-ACIP1 structures of various lengths ([ppat-1003952-g007]), which were difficult to detect in the 1 mM MgCl2 mock control ([ppat-1003952-g007]). The GFP-ACIP1 rods were also detected in response to Pst DC3000 ΔhrcU ([ppat-1003952-g007]), indicating that these structures are associated with PTI in a T3S effector-independent manner. Strikingly, Pst DC3000 AvrBsT infection for 6 h led to the formation of large, bright GFP-ACIP1 aggregates and fewer rod-like structures ([ppat-1003952-g007]). This localization pattern was dependent on AvrBsT's catalytic activity. Pst DC3000 AvrBsT (H154A) infection resulted in a GFP-ACIP1 signal ([ppat-1003952-g007]) similar to that induced by Pst DC3000 alone ([ppat-1003952-g007]). Similarly, Pst DC3000 AvrBsT(K282R) infection led to the formation of GFP-ACIP1 rods ([ppat-1003952-g007]), but not large aggregates. Pi-0 PACIP1::GFP-ACIP1 leaves were inoculated with (A) 1 mM MgCl2 or a 3×108 cells/mL suspension of (B) Pst DC3000 vector, (C) Pst DC3000 ΔhrcU, (D) Pst DC3000 AvrBsT, (E) Pst DC3000 AvrBsT(H154A), (F) Pst DC3000 AvrBsT(K282R), or (G) Pst DC3000 AvrRpt2. Spinning disk confocal images were recorded at 6–7 HPI. Bar = 10 µm. Similar results were obtained in more than 3 independent experiments. To determine if GFP-ACIP1 aggregates are generated specifically by AvrBsT and/or in response to PA production, we tested the phenotype of Pst DC3000 AvrRpt2. AvrRpt2 elicits ETI in Pi-0 leaves [ppat.1003952-Kirik1], which is dependent on PA production [ppat.1003952-Kirik1], [ppat.1003952-Andersson1]. Infection with Pst DC3000 AvrRpt2 induced the formation of GFP-ACIP1 rods ([ppat-1003952-g007]), similar to those formed in response to Pst DC3000 alone, Pst DC3000 AvrBsT(H154A), and Pst DC3000 AvrBsT(K282R) ([ppat-1003952-g007]). However, ACIP1 aggregates were not observed in response to Pst DC3000 AvrRpt2. Pi-0 PACIP1::GFP-ACIP1 leaves were inoculated with 50 µM PA and then imaged the leaves 1.5 hr later. Exogenous PA triggered the formation of several GFP-ACIP1 rods but only a few punctae ([ppat.1003952.s008]), whereas the mock control containing 0.2% DMSO did not ([ppat.1003952.s008]). These data suggest that PA exposure is sufficient to promote the formation of ACIP1 punctae and rods, but not the formation of ACIP1 aggregates. Moreover, they indicate that ACIP1 aggregate formation is a specific phenotype linked to AvrBsT acetyltransferase activity in planta.
!~MM~! Escherichia coli DH5 alpha and Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain GV3101 were grown on Luria agar medium at 37 and 28°C, respectively. Pseudomonas syringae pathovar tomato (Pst) DC3000 strains were grown on nutrient yeast glycerol agar (NYGA) [ppat.1003952-Turner1] at 28°C. E. coli antibiotic selection was 100 µg/mL carbenicillin and/or 50 µg/mL kanamycin. A. tumefaciens antibiotic selection was 100 µg/mL rifampicin, 50 µg/mL kanamycin, and/or 30 µg/mL gentamicin. Pst antibiotic selection was 100 µg/mL rifampicin, and/or 50 µg/mL kanamycin. Arabidopsis thaliana Col-0 and Pi-0 ecotypes were grown in growth chambers (22°C, 60% RH, 125 µE/m2/s fluorescent illumination) on an 8-h light/16-h dark cycle. Plants were transformed using the floral dip method [ppat.1003952-Bent1]. Standard DNA cloning methods [ppat.1003952-Sambrook1], PCR, and Gateway technology (Invitrogen) were used for plasmid construction. All primer sequences are listed in [ppat.1003952.s010]. For GST-AvrBsT, avrBsT (wild type, H154A, C222A, and K282R) was amplified by PCR, cloned into pJET1.2, and then sub-cloned into pGEX-5X-3 using BamHI and XhoI. For Gateway constructions, amplified PCR products (i.e. avrBsT, hopZ1a, hopZ1b, hopZ2, hopZ3, ACIP1, ACIP-like genes (ACIP-L1 to ACIP-L6), and TUA5) were cloned into pCR8 to create donor plasmids. The respective donor plasmids were recombined into: 1) pGADT7 to create AD-gene fusions and pGBKT7 or pXDGATcy86 to create BD-gene fusions for two-hybrid analysis; 2) pDEST15 for GST-fusions; and/or 3) pDEST17 for His6-fusions. For avrBsT mutagenesis, QuikChange Site –Directed Mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) was performed with pCR8(avrBsT) and PfuUltra II Fusion HS DNA polymerase (Agilent). Yeast strain AH109 carrying pXDGATcy86(avrBsT) was transformed with pAD-GAL4-2.1 containing the Horwitz and MA cDNA library isolated from A. thaliana inflorescence meristem, floral meristem, and floral buds (obtained from TAIR). Approximately 7 million transformants were screened and interaction with At3g09980 cDNA was confirmed. Yeast cells were resuspended in lysis buffer (1.85 M NaOH and 7% 2-mercaptoethanol) and then proteins were precipitated in 10% trichloroacetic acid. Protein pellets were washed in 1 M Tris and then resuspended in 8 M urea sample buffer. Protein was extracted from plant cells as described [ppat.1003952-Mudgett1], separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, and then detected by ECL or ECL plus (GE Healthcare) using anti-ACIP1, anti-HA (Covance), anti-Myc (Covance), anti-His (Qiagen), or anti-GST (Santa Cruz) sera and horseradish peroxidase conjugated secondary antibodies (Bio-Rad). Membranes were stained with Ponceau S to control for loading. Recombinant His6-ACIP1 was expressed in E. coli BL21 tRNA cells and purified using Ni-NTA agarose under denaturing conditions following manufacturer's protocol (Qiagen). Polyclonal antisera were raised in rabbits using the purified His-ACIP1 protein (Covance). GST or GST-AvrBsT were expressed in E. coli BL21-CodonPlus(DE3) cells (Stratagene). Cells were lysed in buffer (1X PBS, pH 8, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% 2-mercaptoethanol, and 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (Sigma Aldrich)) with a sonicator (Branson). GST and GST-AvrBsT supernatants were incubated with 30 µL of pre-equilibrated Glutathione Sepharose 4B (GE Healthcare) for 1 h at 4°C with rotation. Sepharose beads were recovered by centrifugation and then washed with buffer for 5 min at 4°C with rotation. GST or GST-AvrBsT (WT, C222A, or K282R) bound beads were incubated with soluble E. coli lysates containing His6-ACIP1 for 2 h at 4°C with rotation. The beads were washed with buffer (50 mM TrisHCl, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 10 mM MgCl2, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 0.1% 2-mercaptoethanol) three times. Protein bound to the beads was separated by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by immunoblot analysis. Anti-GST and anti-His sera were used to detect GST-AvrBsT and His6-ACIP1. Purified recombinant GST-tagged proteins (1 µg each) were incubated with 100 nM inositol hexakisphosphate (IP6) (Santa Cruz), 0.4 µCi 14C-acetyl-CoA (Perkin Elmer) in 50 mM TrisHCl pH 8 and 1 mM DTT for 30 min at RT. Urea sample buffer was added to stop the reactions. Proteins assayed included: GST, GST-AvrBsT, GST-AvrBsT(C222A), GST-AvrBsT(H154A), GST-AvrBsT(K282R), GST-HopZ1a, and GST-ACIP1. Proteins were separated in a 10% SDS-PAGE gel, stained with Coomassie blue, transferred to blotting paper, dried, treated with EN3HANCE (Perkin Elmer), and then exposed to film for 2–3 weeks at 80°C. A 365 bp region of ACIP1 was PCR amplified using primer set JG616/JG617, and the product was cloned into pKANNIBAL to create pKANNIBAL(hp-ACIP). The NotI fragment was then subcloned into pART27 [ppat.1003952-Gleave1], creating pAR27(hp-ACIP). The resulting plasmid was then transformed into A. thaliana ecotypes Col-0 and Pi-0. Transformants were analyzed by quantitative RT-PCR to measure ACIP isoform mRNA levels using primer sets listed in [ppat.1003952.s010]. Fully expanded leaves of 4- to 5-week-old plants were used for bacterial inoculations. A suspension of bacterial cells (Pst DC3000, Pst DC3000 AvrBsT, Pst DC3000 AvrB, Pst DC3000 AvrRpt2, or Pst DC3000 ΔhrcU; 3×108 cells/mL for HR and 1×105 cells/mL for growth curves) was infiltrated into the extracellular space of fully expanded leaves using a 1-mL syringe. For HR, plants were incubated at RT under lights and phenotypes were recorded 9–12 HPI. For growth curves, plants were incubated at high humidity in a growth chamber for 4 d. Leaf tissue was collected at 0–4 DPI, ground in 1 mM MgCl2, diluted and then plated on NYGA plates containing appropriate antibiotics and cycloheximide (50 µg/mL) in triplicate to determine bacterial load. Four plants were used and the experiment was repeated at least three times. The average bacterial titer ± SD is reported. Three fully expanded leaves of 4- to 5-week-old plants (n = 4) were inoculated with a 3×108 cells/mL suspension of Pst DC3000 (vector) or Pst DC3000 (AvrBsT). Ten HPI, three leaf discs (10 mm diameter) per plant were floated in 20 mL of water in petri dishes for 5 min and then transferred to a test tube containing 3 mL of water. Tubes were incubated for 1 h at RT with shaking. Conductivity of the solution was measured with an EC meter (Spectrum Technologies) before and after boiling for 30 min [ppat.1003952-Rizhsky1]. Percent electrolyte leakage was calculated as conductivity before boiling/conductivity after boiling ×100. Assay was repeated at least three times. Three leaf discs (5 mm diameter) from the youngest fully expanded leaves of a 4-week-old plant (n = 9–18) were incubated in water in a 96-well plate (one leaf disc per well) for 24 h. To measure ROS, leaf discs were treated with ± flg22 (100 nM) in 10 µg/mL horseradish peroxidase and 100 µM Luminol (Sigma), and then luminescence was immediately measured with a 1420 Multilabel Counter (PerkinElmer) [ppat.1003952-GomezGomez1]. Relative luminescence units (RLU) are reported. Assay was repeated at least three times. Total RNA was isolated from uninfected or infected leaves using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen) according to manufacturer's instructions. For infection, leaves were inoculated with 1 mM MgCl2 or bacterial strains (2×108 cells/mL in 1 mM MgCl2) and then one leaf from three plants was harvested, pooled, and total RNA was extracted. 2.5 µg of RNA were used for cDNA synthesis. Quantitative RT-PCR was performed using the cDNA and gene-specific primers ([ppat.1003952.s010]). Each cDNA was amplified by real-time PCR using SensiFAST SYBR Kit (Bioline) and the MJ Opticon 2 instrument (Bio-Rad). UBQ5 or ACTIN8 expression was used to normalize the expression value in each sample and relative expression values were determined against the average value of buffer or bacterially infected sample using the comparative Ct method (2−ΔΔCt). To monitor ACIP1 protein expression and localization, the promoter region (1.5-kb upstream of start) was fused with GFP-ACIP1 in the backbone of pMDC43 to create pMDC43(PACIP1::GFP-ACIP1). The resulting plasmid was transformed into A. thaliana Pi-0 plants. Transgenic PACIP1::GFP-ACIP1 lines were then transformed with P35S::mCHERRY-HA-TUA5. This plasmid was construct by modifying pEarleygate 104 [ppat.1003952-Earley1]. YFP was substituted with mCHERRY and Arabidopsis TUA5 genomic coding region was inserted after mCHERRY. Localization of GFP-ACIP1 and mCHERRY-TUA5 in 5-day old dark grown hypocotyls was determined using a Leica TCS SP5 confocal microscope (Leica Microsystems) with Leica LAS AF software and a Leica spinning disc confocal microscope with the Yokogawa CSUX-M1 confocal scanner. Seedlings were treated with 10 µM oryzalin in MeOH for 8 hr at RT or 1 µM latrunculin B in DMSO for 4 hr at RT and then imaged. For infection, Pi-0 PACIP1::GFP-ACIP1 leaves were inoculated with 1 mM MgCl2 or bacterial strains (3×108 cells/mL in 1 mM MgCl2) for 6 h. For exogenous PA treatment, Pi-0 PACIP1::GFP-ACIP1 leaves were inoculated with 50 µM PA in 0.2% DMSO or 0.2% DMSO. Images were analyzed using ImageJ [ppat.1003952-Schneider1].
