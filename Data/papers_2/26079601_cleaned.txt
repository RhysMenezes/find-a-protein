!~ABS~! Plastidial ω-3 desaturase FAD7 is a major contributor to trienoic fatty acid biosynthesis in the leaves of Arabidopsis plants. However, the precise contribution of the other plastidial ω-3 desaturase, FAD8, is poorly understood. Fatty acid and lipid analysis of several ω-3 desaturase mutants, including two insertion lines of AtFAD7 and AtFAD8 , showed that FAD8 partially compensated the disruption of the AtFAD7 gene at 22°C, indicating that FAD8 was active at this growth temperature, contrasting to previous observations that circumscribed the FAD8 activity at low temperatures. Our data revealed that FAD8 had a higher selectivity for 18:2 acyl-lipid substrates and a higher preference for lipids other than galactolipids, particularly phosphatidylglycerol, at any of the temperatures studied. Differences in the mechanism controlling AtFAD7 and AtFAD8 gene expression at different temperatures were also detected. Confocal microscopy and biochemical analysis of FAD8-YFP over-expressing lines confirmed the chloroplast envelope localization of FAD8. Co-localization experiments suggested that FAD8 and FAD7 might be located in close vicinity in the envelope membrane. FAD8-YFP over-expressing lines showed a specific increase in 18:3 fatty acids at 22°C. Together, these results indicate that the function of both plastidial ω-3 desaturases is coordinated in a non-redundant manner.
!~RES~! A search for single fad7 and fad8 ethyl methanesulfonate (EMS) mutants at the NASC repository resulted in a single fad7 mutant (N8042) but no single fad8 locus accession. On the contrary, several T-DNA insertion lines mutated in the plastidial ω-3 desaturases were recovered from the NASC repository. Only two of them showed insertions exclusively in the AtFAD7 ( At3g11370 ) or AtFAD8 ( At5g05560 ) genes and were further characterized. These lines were SALK_147096C, designated as fad7i , and SALK_093590, designated as fad8i . Genomic analysis of fad7i plants revealed two insertions of an inverted tandem T-DNA in the AtFAD7 gene; one located at 6 bp downstream of exon 7 and the other located within intron 6 at 8 bp downstream of the end of exon 6 ( [fig1] A). Genomic analysis of fad8i plants showed insertion of an inverted tandem T-DNA 133 bp downstream of the start codon, within exon 1 of the AtFAD8 gene ( [fig1] A). RT−PCR characterization of 2-week-old fad7i and fad8i plants indicated the absence of AtFAD7 and AtFAD8 transcripts in the corresponding mutants ( [fig1] B). Homozygous fad7i and fad8i mutant lines were segregated and further analyzed. None of the fad7i and fad8i plants showed any significant alterations in growth at control temperatures, developing normal rosette leaves. They germinated normally and grew in soil, producing seeds like the rest of the plant lines used in this study with the exception of the fad3 fad7 fad8 mutant, which was sterile and did not produce seeds except when treated with jasmonic acid ( [bib33] ). The fad7 fad8 and fad3 fad7 fad8 mutants have been described previously ( [bib34 bib33] ). They derived from single EMS mutants that were crossed to obtain both the double fad7 fad8 and triple fad3 fad7 fad8 mutants. We further characterized these mutants at the genetic level. The fad8 mutation from the fad7 fad8 double mutant has been characterized previously ( [bib19] ). Sequencing of the AtFAD8 gene in either genomic or cDNA from the double fad7 fad8 mutant confirmed these results, showing a point mutation of G (W residue) for A (STOP codon) substitution in residue 149 of the FAD8 protein. On the contrary, we were not able to find any sequencing data for the fad7 mutation. Sequencing of the AtFAD7 gene in either genomic or cDNA from the double fad7 fad8 mutant showed a point mutation that introduced a substitution of G (W residue) for A (STOP codon) in residue 141 of the FAD7 protein. Sequencing analysis of the AtFAD7 and AtFAD8 genes in the triple mutant showed identical substitutions to those found in the double fad7 fad8 mutant. Finally, sequencing of the AtFAD3 gene ( At2g29980 ) in the fad3 fad7 fad8 mutant resulted in a mutation of G for A. This introduced a substitution of C for Y in residue 103 of the mature protein. It is worth mentioning that this residue is part of the first His box essential for desaturase function. We analyzed the fatty acid composition of total leaf lipids from Col-0 and the different mutant lines grown at 22°C for 4 weeks ( [fig2] A). Average TA levels in Col-0 were 40.1% of linolenic acid (18:3) and 8.6% of hexadecatrienoic acid (16:3); 16.7% of linoleic (18:2) and 1.8% of hexadecadienoic acid (16:2) were also detected ( [fig2] A). These values were within the range previously observed for the Col-0 line ( [bib19 bib34] ). Disruption of the AtFAD7 gene in the fad7i mutant resulted in a reduction of TAs with an 18:3 content of 29.6% and an even more reduced content of 16:3 down to 2% ( [fig2] A). These average percentages indicated that fad7i maintained 74% of 18:3 production with respect to Col-0 while only 23% of 16:3 synthesis was maintained in this mutant. On the contrary, disruption of the AtFAD8 gene in fad8i resulted in TA levels almost similar to those from Col-0 ( [fig2] A). The fad7 fad8 double mutant also showed a considerable reduction in TA, particularly in 16:3, which was undetectable ( [fig2] A). Levels of 18:3 were also reduced to 12.3% in this mutant ( [fig2] A), indicating that in the absence of plastidial ω-3 desaturase activity, FAD3 accounted for approximately 30% of the synthesized 18:3 with respect to that from Col-0. It is worth mentioning that this reduction in TAs was even greater than that previously reported in [bib19] for their double fad7 fad8 mutant. Finally, the fad3 fad7 fad8 triple mutant showed no accumulation of TAs, consistent with the disruption of all ω-3 fatty acid desaturase genes ( [fig2] A). The absence of TAs was accompanied by a strong increase in DAs, which reached average percentages of 68.5% of 18:2 and 10% of 16:2. Given the strong reduction (70%) in 18:3 content observed in the fad7 fad8 double mutant, the data obtained in fad7i indicated that, after disruption of the AtFAD7 gene, FAD8 enzymatic activity was able to maintain, at least partially (43.7%), the amount of 18:3 and to a much lesser extent that of 16:3 (23.2%) at 22°C ( [fig2] A). To investigate the effect of the disruption of the AtFAD7 and AtFAD8 genes on the lipid profiles in more detail, polar lipid classes were separated by bi-dimensional thin-layer chromatography (2D-TLC) and their fatty acid composition was determined by gas chromatography (GC). The lipid composition in the Col-0 plants was similar to that reported previously ( [bib34] ). No relevant modifications in the amount of lipids were observed in the different mutant lines at 22°C (see [mmc1] ). This result is consistent with previous observations in other fatty acid desaturase mutants ( [bib35 bib11 bib34] ). The fatty acid composition of each lipid class in Col-0 and mutant lines is shown in [mmc1] . Monogalactosyldiacylglycerol (MGDG) showed a high content of 18:3 and 16:3 in Col-0, with percentages of 59% and 28.2%, respectively ( [fig2] B). MGDG from the fad7i mutant showed a 48% and 82% reduction of 18:3 and 16:3, respectively, compared with Col-0, whereas the disruption of the AtFAD8 gene resulted in minor changes in the fatty acid composition of MGDG ( [fig2] B). As observed in total lipids, very low amounts of 18:3 (7% of total) were detected in MGDG from the fad7 fad8 double mutant while 16:3 was undetectable ( [fig2] B). Similarly, neither 16:3 nor 18:3 were detected in the fad3 fad7 fad8 triple mutant ( [fig2] B). Comparison of the TA content in MGDG of the fad7i , fad8i and fad7 fad8 mutants at 22°C indicated that in fad7i , FAD8 activity was capable of partially maintaining the 18:3 content of MGDG, while its capacity to maintain 16:3 levels was very much reduced. A similar conclusion could be reached from the analysis of digalactosyldiacylglycerol (DGDG) or phosphatidylcholine (PC), having in mind that DGDG has highly reduced 16:3 levels even in Col-0 and PC has no 16:3 ( [fig2] B). On the contrary, different results were obtained when phosphatidylglycerol (PG) was analyzed. As shown in [fig2] B, 18:3 levels in Col-0 PG were around 27.3%, while in the fad7i mutant, it reached 17.8%, a 33% reduction compared with Col-0 ( [fig2] B). Interestingly, disruption of the AtFAD8 gene resulted in even lower levels of 18:3 in PG of 13% from total fatty acids (i.e., a 56% reduction with respect to Col-0; [fig2] B). An even stronger reduction of 77% (from 27% to 6%) was observed in PG from the fad7 fad8 double mutant ( [fig2] B). This 18:3 PG found in the fad7 fad8 double mutant probably originated from extraplastidial biosynthesis of PG in the ER ( [bib52] ). Finally, no 18:3 was detected in PG from the fad3 fad7 fad8 triple mutant. These results suggested that at 22°C, disruption of the AtFAD8 gene affected the 18:3 content of the PG fraction more than that of the AtFAD7 gene. The effect of low (8°C) and high (30°C) temperatures on leaf lipid fatty acid composition in Col-0 and the different mutant lines was also investigated. No significant modifications in the leaf 18:3 content from total lipids isolated from Col-0 or the different mutant lines were detected upon exposure to 8°C for 1 week compared with 22°C ( [fig3] A). Analysis of MGDG, DGDG, or PG further confirmed the absence of significant changes in the leaf TA content upon exposure to low temperatures, with the exception of PC, for which a decrease of 18:3 was detected in the fad8i mutant ( [fig3] B and [mmc1] ). The leaf fatty acid composition from total lipids of Col-0 was not greatly affected by their exposure to 30°C ( [fig3] A and [mmc1] ). On the contrary, a reduction in TA levels was observed in total lipids from all mutant lines ( [fig3] A). Fatty acids from total lipids of fad7i showed an important decrease in both 18:3 and 16:3 (down to 13% and 0.5%, respectively; [fig3] A). These values meant an average reduction of 18:3 and 16:3 content of 69.7% and 94%, respectively, compared with Col-0 ( [fig3] A). This reduction in TA levels in fad7i at 30°C was more pronounced than that detected for the same line at 22°C ( [fig3] A). A reduction of TA in the fad8i mutant was also detected at 30°C. As shown in [fig3] A, 18:3 and 16:3 decreased to 28.8% and 4.5%, respectively. These results represented a 26% and 51% reduction for 18:3 and 16:3, respectively, compared with Col-0 at the same temperature. These data indicated that fad7i was more affected than fad8i at 30°C. A similar conclusion could be drawn from the analysis of the fatty acid composition of individual lipid classes. The 18:3 content in MGDG showed no significant modification upon exposure of Col-0 plants to 30°C compared with the same line at 22°C ( [fig3] B). In contrast, the 16:3 content in MGDG was more affected, with a 6% decrease compared with Col-0 at 22°C. The TA content of the MGDG from the fad7i mutant showed a strong decrease of 18:3 and 16:3 upon exposure to 30°C, down to 10.5% and 0.6%, respectively ( [fig3] B). These values meant an average reduction of 66% and 86.4% in the 18:3 and 16:3 content of MGDG, respectively, with respect to the same line grown at 22°C ( [fig3] B). In fad8i , 18:3 and 16:3 decreased down to 40.8% and 13.7%, respectively ( [fig3] B). These values represented an average reduction of 25.8% and 42.9% in the 18:3 and 16:3 content, respectively, with respect to the same line at 22°C ( [fig3] B). These data suggested that FAD8 activity on MGDG substrates was more affected by exposure to 30°C than FAD7 activity. This conclusion could be extended to other lipids such as DGDG, PC, or sulfoquinovosyldiacylglycerol (SQ) ( [fig3] B and [mmc1] ). The fad7 fad8 double mutant also showed a decrease in 18:3 content of MGDG, indicating that FAD3 activity had little or no effect on the fatty acid composition of MGDG at high temperatures ( [fig3] B). Finally, the amount of TA in PG decreased in all plants analyzed compared with 22°C including Col-0, in which a decrease from 27.3% to 14.8% was detected ( [fig3] B). In fad7i and fad8i , 18:3 strongly decreased (down to 3.9% and 5.4%, respectively) to levels very similar to those from the fad7 fad8 double mutant (2%) ( [fig3] B). We decided to correlate the differences found in the fatty acid composition of the different mutant lines with the expression of the AtFAD3 , AtFAD7 , and AtFAD8 genes. Quantitative PCR (q-PCR) expression analysis of these genes in leaves from Col-0 and mutant plants grown at 22°C or upon exposure to 8°C or 30°C for 1 week are shown in [fig4] . Since the triple mutant did not accumulate TAs, the expression analysis was focused in those plant lines in which changes in TAs were detected. At 22°C, transcripts from AtFAD3 , AtFAD7 , and AtFAD8 genes were detected in leaves from 4-week old Col-0 plants. T-DNA insertion provoked the absence of AtFAD8 mRNA in the fad8i mutant ( [fig4] ). Very small amounts of AtFAD7 mRNA were detected in the fad7i mutant in the q-PCR analysis. This small amount of AtFAD7 mRNA might represent truncated forms of the transcript that are detected in the q-PCR analysis since the primers were designed in the N-terminal region of the protein. This was done to avoid cross-amplification with the highly homologous AtFAD8 gene. Disruption of the AtFAD7 and AtFAD8 genes in the insertion mutants did not result in significant changes in the transcript levels of the AtFAD8 and AtFAD7 genes, respectively ( [fig4] A). Similarly, disruption of one or both AtFAD7 and AtFAD8 genes did not modify the transcript levels of the ER ω-3 desaturase FAD3 ( [fig4] A). Interestingly, this absence of compensatory responses at the transcriptional level was also observed when the expression of the genes encoding ω-3 fatty acid desaturases was analyzed at either a low (8°C) or high (30°C) temperature. Then, we focused our analysis on the Col-0 line where the three AtFAD3 , AtFAD7 , and AtFAD8 genes were normally expressed. Col-0 plants exposed to 8°C for 1 week showed a two-fold increase in AtFAD8 mRNA compared with control (22°C) plants ( [fig4] B). This increase was accompanied by a reduction in the AtFAD7 transcript levels at low temperatures. These changes in AtFAD7 and AtFAD8 transcripts detected at 8°C were not accompanied by changes in AtFAD3 mRNA ( [fig4] B). On the other hand, Col-0 plants exposed to 30°C showed a significant ( p < 0.05) decrease in the AtFAD8 transcript with respect to control (22°C) plants ( [fig4] B). This could be consistent with the higher sensitivity of FAD8 activity at 30°C ( [fig2] and [fig3] ). The presence of a chloroplast transit peptide in the AtFAD8 gene sequence suggested that the FAD8 protein might be located in the plastid ( [bib19] ). To investigate FAD8 function at the protein level, we first analyzed its sub-cellular localization generating stable transgenic Arabidopsis lines expressing the AtFAD8 gene fused to YFP at its C terminus, under the control of a constitutive 35S promoter. Transgenic lines generated with the 35S: FAD8-YFP construct showed a strong YFP fluorescence signal associated with chloroplasts from leaves ( [fig5] B) that was absent in leaves from plants carrying the empty pEarley101 vector ( [fig5] A). This YFP signal was found in chloroplasts from mesophyll cells ( [fig5] B, 5C, and 5F) as well as in the small chloroplasts from guard cells ( [fig5] D–5E). The YFP signal was not uniform but detected at specific spots or foci on the chloroplast ( [fig5] B–5F). To confirm these results, we performed transient expression experiments in Nicotiana benthamiana leaves. The transiently expressed FAD8-YFP protein showed an abundant fluorescent signal associated with plastids ( [fig5] H and 5I), further corroborating the plastidial localization of FAD8. The signal showed the same pattern of accumulation in foci as occurred in the stable transgenic lines ( [fig5] H and 5I). A similar pattern of small dots on the surface of the chloroplast was also obtained when GFP or CFP were used instead of YFP, suggesting that the pattern observed for FAD8-YFP was not due to the nature of the fluorescent tag ( [mmc1] ). This pattern of localization in discrete foci is shared with many other proteins localized in the plastid, and more specifically in the plastid envelope, expressed under the control of either constitutive or endogenous promoters ( [bib21 bib30 bib12 bib39 bib51] ). To analyze this in detail, Tic40 was used as a control of envelope localization. Tic40 is a component of the TIC translocon and is localized in the inner envelope membrane of the chloroplast ( [bib42] ). It has been previously used as a tool for in vivo chloroplast envelope localizations ( [bib8] ). Tic40-GFP was transiently expressed in N. benthamiana leaves. As shown in [fig5] J and 5K, we obtained green small dots structures associated with chloroplast autofluorescence. This pattern was similar to that reported by [bib8] for the same protein and that obtained for our 35S:FAD8-YFP construct, supporting the envelope localization of FAD8. To further confirm the plastidial localization of the FAD8 protein, biochemical fractionation of chloroplasts was carried out, followed by immunoblotting with an anti-GFP antibody that also recognizes the YFP protein. Chloroplasts from leaves of 3-week-old Arabidopsis plants grown at 22°C, carrying both the empty vector and the FAD8-YFP construct, were analyzed. A strong band at the appropriate molecular weight for the FAD8-YFP fusion protein (79–72 kDa) was detected in the transgenic extracts while no signal was observed in plants carrying the empty vector ( [fig6] A). Minor bands around 27–30 kDa could also be detected, probably corresponding to processed YFP protein. The resolution of the confocal microscope cannot inform us about the precise localization of the FAD8 protein within the different chloroplast sub-compartments. Therefore, the sub-chloroplast membrane distribution of the FAD8-YFP protein was sought. To that end, plants were grown for 3 weeks under short light period conditions to favor rosette leaf formation, and intact chloroplasts were isolated through Percoll gradient centrifugation ( [bib3] ). Intact chloroplasts were lysed and envelope, stroma, and thylakoid fractions were separated through sucrose gradient centrifugation ( [bib3] ). Fractions were blotted using an anti-GFP antibody to detect the FAD8-YFP protein. Several antibodies were used as specific markers of the different chloroplast sub-fractions. Tic40, RuBisCO, and the Photosystem II D1 subunit were used as markers of the envelope, stroma, and thylakoid, respectively. The results are shown in [fig6] B. The FAD8-YFP protein was detected in the envelope fraction with no detection in the soluble stroma fraction or in the thylakoid membrane. The FAD8-YFP protein distribution was similar to that of Tic40, the envelope marker, indicating that FAD8-YFP was located in the plastid envelope. At this point we analyzed whether both plastidial ω-3 desaturases, FAD8 and FAD7, showed similar or different localization patterns in the plastid. To that end, we performed transient expression experiments in N. benthamiana leaves in which a 35S:FAD8-CFP construct was co-transformed with a 35S:FAD7-YFP construct. As shown in [fig7] , the FAD7-YFP signal was also detected in small dots or foci on the surface of the chloroplasts from N. benthamiana ( [fig7] A and 7F), showing a similar accumulation pattern to that observed for FAD8-CFP ( [fig7] B and 7G) or FAD8-YFP ( [fig5] ). These results suggested that both FAD7 and FAD8 ω-3 desaturases showed a similar pattern of localization in the plastid envelope. Special care was taken to confirm that no YFP signal was detected through the CFP channel or vice versa under our experimental conditions. Interestingly, when both FAD7-YFP and FAD8-CFP signals were merged, many of the spots seemed to overlap ( [fig7] D and 7H), suggesting that both FAD7 and FAD8 desaturases could be located in close vicinity within the membrane. To gain further insight into the function of the FAD8 protein, the fatty acid composition from total lipids was analyzed in the previously characterized FAD8-YFP over-expressing Arabidopsis lines in which the FAD8 protein was located in the plastid envelope. As shown in [fig8] A, total lipids from different FAD8 over-expressing lines showed an 8%–10% increase in 18:3 levels compared with the plants expressing the empty vector. Interestingly, no modification in 16:3 fatty acids was observed ( [fig8] A). This result might be consistent with the data obtained from the analysis of the insertion lines that suggested that FAD8 might be more specific on 18:2 rather than 16:2 substrates ( [fig2] ). The effect on lipid classes of the over-expression of the AtFAD8 gene was also studied. The transgenic event with the highest increase in 18:3 was further analyzed. No changes in the 18:3 or 16:3 content from the galactolipids MGDG or DGDG was observed in the FAD8 over-expressing lines, further confirming the results obtained in the insertion mutants ( [fig8] B). Different results were obtained when the phospholipids were analyzed. As shown in [fig8] B, PG showed a 4%–5% increase in 18:3 levels in the FAD8 over-expressing plants. This increase was concomitant with the decrease in 18:2, indicating a higher ω-3 desaturase activity. Surprisingly, a lipid like PC, mainly present in the ER, also showed an increase in 18:3 levels in the FAD8 over-expressing lines compared with the plants carrying the empty vector ( [fig8] B). This increase (8%–10%) was again accompanied by a decrease in 18:2 levels. This increase in 18:3 in extraplastidic lipids was also observed in other lipids such as phosphatidylethanolamine or phosphatidylinositol (data not shown). Finally, sulfolipids (SQ) also showed a small (5%) but significant ( p < 0.1) increase in 18:3 in the FAD8 over-expressing lines.
!~MM~! The lines of Arabidopsis thaliana used were descended from the Columbia 0 ecotype (Col-0). Two insertional mutants from SALK were used: fad7i (SALK_147096C) and fad8i (SALK_093590). These insertion lines were selected after discarding other plant lines carrying insertions in loci other than AtFAD8 ( At5g05570 ). We also used a double fad7-1 fad8-1 mutant from NASC (NASC N8036) and a triple mutant ( fad3-2 fad7-2 fad8-1 ), a kind gift from Prof. John Browse (Washington State University, Pullman, WA, USA). All plants were grown on soil in a bioclimatic chamber under a light intensity of 120–150 μmol −2 s −1 , with a 16 h/8 h light/dark photoperiod at 22°C and a relative humidity of 45%. After 3 weeks of growth, plants were kept at 22°C (control treatment), or transferred to 30°C (high-temperature treatment) or 8°C (low-temperature treatment) for an additional week. Three pools of rosette leaves from each plant line were collected at the end of the treatment, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at –80°C until use. PCR on genomic DNA was performed using the primer LB (5′-TGGTTCACGTAGTGGGCCATCG-3′, http://signal.salk.edu/tdnaprimers.html ) or the RB primer 5′-GTCATAACGTGACTCCCTTAATTCTCC-3′) in combination with the AtFAD7 (7F, 5′-CAAGTTCTAATGGCGAACTTGGTCTTA-3′ and 7R, 5′-CAAGCCTGCTTCATTTCAATCTGCTCT-3′) and AtFAD8 (8F, 5′-CTTGGGAAGAGGCTCCAAT-3′ and 8R, 5′-GTAACTTGTCTGCCTGGTTCAC-3′) gene-specific primers. PCR of the entire gene was also performed with the AtFAD7 and AtFAD8 primers to check the homozygosis of the mutations. The presence of a pROK vector fragment used to generate SALK lines was confirmed by sequencing (CNIO, Madrid, Spain). The AtFAD3 , AtFAD7 , and AtFAD8 genes from the double fad7 fad8 and triple fad3 fad7 fad8 mutants were also sequenced to analyze the mutations in the corresponding genes. Total lipids were extracted from 0.5 g of rosette leaves as described ( [bib7] ). Individual lipids were purified by 2D-TLC according to [bib23] . Fatty acid methyl esters of total lipids or individual lipid classes were produced by acid-catalyzed transmethylation ( [bib18] ) and analyzed by GC (7890A; Agilent, Santa Clara, CA USA) fitted with a capillary column (30-m long; 0.32-mm inner diameter; 0.2-μm film thickness) of fused silica (Supelco, Bellafonte, PA, USA) and a flame ionization detector. 17:0 was used as an internal standard. Hydrogen was used as a carrier gas with a linear rate of 1.34 ml min −1 and split ratio of 1:50. The injector and detector temperature was 220°C and the oven temperature was 170°C. Data from the fatty acid analysis were obtained from three independent biological experiments with two technical repeats for each experiment. Analysis of variance was applied to compare treatments. Statistical analyses were carried out with Statgraphics Plus for Windows 2.1 (Statistical Graphics Corp.: Warrenton, Virginia, USA), using a level of significance of 0.05. Total RNA was isolated from 0.1 g of rosette leave tissues with Trizol (Life Technologies: Carlsbad, California, USA) and first-strand cDNA was synthesized from 3 μg of total RNA with M-MLV reverse transcriptase (Promega: Fitchburg, Wisconsin, USA) and oligo dT. q-PCR was performed using a 7500 Real Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems) and SYBR Green Master Mix (Applied Biosystems: Foster City, California, USA). The gene expression levels were calculated relative to EF1α reference gene ( At5g60390 ) using the 2 −ΔΔCt method ( [bib29] ). The oligonucleotides used were: q AtFAD3F , 5′-CGCCACGAAAGCAGCTAAAC-3′ and q AtFAD3R , 5′-TCGGTATTGCTCCTGACGTCTT-3′; q AtFAD7F , 5′-CTCTCCAACAACAACAAATTCAGAC-3′ and q AtFAD7R , 5′-CCAAAAGACAGAGGAGATGATGAT-3′; q AtFAD8F , 5′-GCCTCTAACCCTAAACCCA-3′ and q AtFAD8R , 5′-CGGGAATTGAGAAGAGAAGAA-3′; qEF1-αF , 5′-TGAGCACGCTCTTCTTGCTTTCA-3′, and qEF1-αR , 5′-GGTGGTGGCATCCATCTTGTTACA-3′. Data were obtained from the analysis of three independent biological experiments with at least three technical repeats for each experiment. The AtFAD8 (At5g05580) coding sequence was amplified by PCR using the specific primers 5′- CACC ATGGCGAGCTCGGTTTTAT-3′ and 5′- GGC TGTTCTTTGTCCATTGAGTTTTGGAT-3′ and cloned in the pENTER-TOPO vector. The forward primers included CACC for TOPO cloning, and the reverse primers were modified to change the stop codon to alanine. PCR reactions were performed with Phusion High-fidelity DNA polymerase (Thermo Scientific: Waltham, Massachusetts, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. pENTR vector construction was also performed according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen: Waltham, Massachusetts, USA) and used for Escherichia coli DH5α transformation. The AtFAD8 gene, now flanked by the appropriate AttL sites, was sub-cloned into the GATEWAY-compatible binary vector pEarleyGate101 fused to the YFP at the C terminus under the control of a 35S constitutive promoter ( [bib16] ). Construction of destination vectors was performed using Gateway LR clonase II enzyme mix (Invitrogen). The resulting construct and the empty vector used as negative control were introduced into Agrobacterium tumefaciens (strain GV3101 pMP90) by electroporation. Selection medium was kanamycin in E. coli and gentamycin + kanamycin in A. tumefaciens . Sequencing and colony PCR were performed at all stages to ensure correct sequence and alignment. Arabidopsis plants were transformed with A. tumefaciens harboring the constructs FAD8-YFP and pEarlyGate101 as negative control by the simplified floral dip method ( [bib13] ). Seeds were collected and selected in Murashige and Skoog plates supplemented with glufosinate ammonium herbicide. After three generations, only homozygous plants were selected. For the experiments with the transgenic lines, two different transgenic homozygous events (1.13 and 3.1) were analyzed. Different constructs were used for transient expression experiments in N. benthamiana leaves. In addition to the 35S:FAD8-YFP construct used for the generation of the stable FAD8 over-expressing lines, TIC40 (At5g16620), which encodes a component of the TIC (Translocon of the inner chloroplast membrane complex), was used as an inner envelope membrane marker for localization studies. Specific primers for Tic40, Tic40F, 5′-CACCATGGAGAACCTTACCCTAGTTTCT-3′ and Tic40R, 5′-GGCACCCGTCATTCCTGGGAAC-3′ were used for amplification of the TIC40 gene and cloned in the pENTER-TOPO (Invitrogen: Waltham, Massachusetts, USA) vector. In this case, the pMDC83 vector ( [bib14] ), which carries a 35S constitutive promoter and GFP as C-terminal fluorescent tag, was used for localization analysis. A 35S:FAD8-GFP was also generated from the cloned AtFAD8 gene and pMDC83 vector as described above. For co-localization purposes, two additional constructs were also generated. The AtFAD7 gene (At3g11170) was amplified with specific primers AtFAD7F: 5′- CACC ATGGCGAACTTGGTCTTATC-3′ and AtFAD7R: 5′- GGC ATCTGCTCTTACTTTGACCTCTC-3′, and cloned in the pENTER-TOPO vector. pEarley 101 was used as the destination vector to generate a 35S:FAD7-YFP construct. A second 35S:FAD8-CFP construct was also generated using pEarley 102 as the destination vector. N. benthamiana leaves from 5-week-old plants, grown at 22°C, 16 h light, 8 h dark photo period, were infiltrated with A. tumefaciens cultures (OD 600 nm 0.5), harboring either FAD8-YFP, FAD8-GFP, FAD8-CFP, Tic40-GFP, or the empty vectors (pEarley101, pEarley102, or pMDC83). All constructs were co-infiltrated with the p19 plasmid to avoid silencing ( [bib45] ), according to [bib24] . For co-localization experiments, a combination of A. tumefaciens cultures (OD 600 nm 0.5) carrying either the FAD7-YFP or the FAD8-CFP constructs were used. Plants were kept in the growth chamber for another 3–5 days before analysis. Fresh leaf imaging was carried out on a Leica TCS SP II confocal microscope. Images were acquired using a 40×, 63×, or 100× oil immersion objective. Imaging of GFP, YFP, and CFP emissions was performed by sequential scanning. GFP, YFP, and CFP were excited with the 488, 514 and 458 nm lines, respectively, of an argon laser and the emission collected through a 505–560 nm emission filter for GFP, 518–580 nm emission filter for YFP, and 465–571 nm for CFP. Autofluorescence of chlorophyll was excited with the 633 nm line of an argon laser and the emission was collected through a 651–717 nm emission filter. Images were taken with six to eight line averaging. Images were analyzed and merged using Leica AF (Leica Microsystems AG, Wetzlar, Germany) and ImageJ software (National Institutes of Health (NIH), USA). Protein extracts were obtained from 0.5 g of Arabidopsis rosette leaves crushed in a mortar with liquid nitrogen. The powder was then dispersed in buffer A (0.1 M Tris-HCl [pH 7.5], 20% w/v glycerol, 1 mM EDTA, 10 mM MgCl 2 , 14 mM β-mercaptoethanol, 100 μg/ml Pefabloc (Fluka: San Luis, Missouri, USA), 1 μg/ml antipain (Sigma-Aldrich: San Luis, Missouri, USA), and 1 μg/ml leupeptin (Sigma-Aldrich), and filtered through a layer of Miracloth paper (Calbiochem: Darmstadt, Germany). Chloroplasts and further sub-chloroplast fractionation into thylakoid, stroma, and envelope fractions was performed as described in [bib3] . The protein content of the different fractions was estimated using the Bio-Rad protein assay reagent. Total protein of 10 μg was loaded per lane. Western blot procedures were performed as described in [bib2] using commercial antibodies against GFP (ab290, Abcam: Cambridge, UK) or Tic40, RuBisCO, and D1 (Agrisera: Vännäs, Sweden) as protein markers of the envelope, stroma, and thylakoid fractions, respectively. Antibody dilutions were 1:2000 for Tic40 and D1 and 1:10 000 for RuBisCO. Detection was carried out using a highly sensitive chemiluminescent reagent for peroxidase detection (SuperSignal West Pico, Pierce: Carlsbad, California, USA).
