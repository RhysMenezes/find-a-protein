!~ABS~! Vascular tissues are very important for providing both mechanical strength and long‐distance transport. The molecular mechanisms of regulation of vascular tissue development are still not fully understood. In this study we identified ANAC005 as a membrane‐associated NAC family transcription factor that regulates vascular tissue development. Reporter gene assays showed that ANAC005 was expressed mainly in the vascular tissues. Increased expression of ANAC005 protein in transgenic Arabidopsis caused dwarf phenotype, reduced xylem differentiation, decreased lignin content, repression of a lignin biosynthetic gene and genes related to cambium and primary wall, but activation of genes related to the secondary wall. Expression of a dominant repressor fusion of ANAC005 had overall the opposite effects on vascular tissue differentiation and lignin synthetic gene expression. The ANAC005‐GFP fusion protein was localized at the plasma membrane, whereas deletion of the last 20 amino acids, which are mostly basic, caused its nuclear localization. These results indicate that ANAC005 is a cell membrane‐associated transcription factor that inhibits xylem tissue development in Arabidopsis.
!~RES~! ANAC005 is a NAC gene preferentially expressed in xylem according to a tissue specific microarray analysis (Zhao et al. [jipb12379-bib-0044]). We first performed quantitative reverse transcription‐polymerase chain reaction (qRT‐PCR) to examine the expression of ANAC005 in different Arabidopsis tissues and organs. ANAC005 was ubiquitously expressed at a similar level in 1‐week‐old seedlings, roots and rosette leaves of 3‐week‐old plants, stem of 4‐week‐old plants and other organs of 6‐week‐old plants (Figure [jipb12379-fig-0001]A). To further investigate the expression pattern of ANAC005, a 2.7 kb genomic sequence, including 1.1 kb promoter region and the 1.6 kb coding region, was fused to the Escherichia coli β‐glucuronidase (GUS) reporter gene and transformed into Arabidopsis. As shown in Figure [jipb12379-fig-0001]B–H, the proANAC005::ANAC005‐GUS transgenic plants showed GUS activity in the vascular system of the cotyledons, rosette leaves, petioles, and inflorescence stem. A section of the inflorescence stem shows the highest GUS signal in the thin‐walled cells (presumably developing tracheary element) adjacent to the thick‐walled tracheary elements in xylem. No GUS signal was observed in the mature tracheary elements, suggesting that ANAC005 is highly expressed during tracheary element development. Weak GUS signals were also observed in the phloem cells of vascular tissue (Figure [jipb12379-fig-0001]H). GUS expression was also detected preferentially in vascular tissues of cauline leaves, petals, and stigma. These results indicate that ANAC005 is mainly expressed in the vascular tissues of all organs in Arabidopsis. These results are consistent with the reported microarray result showing that ANAC005 is expressed at a higher level in xylem compared with phloem and non‐vascular system (Zhao et al [jipb12379-bib-0044]). ANAC005 is expressed preferentially in vascular bundles (A) Analysis of ANAC005 expression level in different organs by quantitative reverse transcription‐polymerase chain reaction (qRT‐PCR).

To determine the subcellular localization of ANAC005, we made an ANAC005‐GFP (green fluorescent protein) fusion protein construct, driven by the Cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV) 35S promoter, and transformed it into Nicotiana benthamiana. In the epidermal cells of Nicotiana benthamiana transformed with 35S::GFP, GFP fluorescence was visible in both nucleus and cytoplasm (Figure [jipb12379-fig-0002]B). By contrast, the ANAC005‐GFP fluorescence was only detected at the plasma membrane (Figure [jipb12379-fig-0002]C, D). Protein structure analysis showed that the N‐terminal of ANAC005 has a NAM domain including A, B, C, D and E motifs; its C‐terminus is a putative transcription regulation domain (Figure S1). ANAC005 does not belong to the 18 NAC proteins previously identified as putatively MTFs. We further examined the ANAC005 sequence using the TopPred‐v2 program, and identified a putative transmembrane motif (TM motif) in the middle region (aa268‐288). In order to test whether the putative TM motif determines the localization of ANAC005, we made several truncated ANAC005 proteins fused with GFP protein (Figure [jipb12379-fig-0002]E–I). When expressed in Nicotiana benthamiana driven by the CaMV 35S promoter, full‐length ANAC005‐GFP was localized exclusively at the plasma membrane (Figure [jipb12379-fig-0002]C). In contrast, ANAC005(1‐272)‐GFP (with deletion of C‐terminal 90 amino acids), ANAC005(1‐302)‐GFP (with deletion of C‐terminal 60 amino acids), ANAC005(1‐332)‐GFP (with deletion of C‐terminal 30 amino acids), and ANAC005(1‐342)‐GFP (with deletion of C‐terminal 20 amino acids) were all localized in the nucleus (Figure [jipb12379-fig-0002]E–H). However, deletion of the C‐terminal 10 amino acids resulted in localization in both nucleus and plasma membrane (Figure [jipb12379-fig-0002]I). These results show that C‐terminal 20 amino acids of ANAC005 play an important role in its localization of to the plasma membrane, whereas the N‐terminal region specifies nuclear localization.

(D) Fluorescence microscopic image of plasmolysis of Nicotiana benthamiana leaf epidermal cells transformed with 35S:ANAC005‐GFP. Yellow arrows marker the places where plasmolysis happen. The proANAC005::ANAC005‐GUS transgenic plants showed dwarf phenotypes with round rosette leaves, and the severity of phenotypes correlated with the intensities of GUS staining, indicating that expression of ANAC005‐GUS caused the dwarf phenotypes (Figure [jipb12379-fig-0003]A, B). The tissue‐specific pattern of GUS staining, however, remained the same in lines that showed different levels of GUS and phenotype severity (Figures [jipb12379-fig-0003]B, S3B). Similar dwarf phenotypes were observed in transgenic plants expressing the non‐fusion ANAC005 or ANAC005‐GFP fusion proteins, but the non‐fusion ANAC005 appeared to cause milder phenotypes compared to the GUS and GFP fusions (Figure [jipb12379-fig-0003]C). Compared with wild type plants, the transgenic plants expressing high levels of ANAC005 have shorter petiole and oval leaves (Figure [jipb12379-fig-0003]C, D). Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis showed the cell elongation is reduced in ANAC005‐GFP transgenic plants (Figure [jipb12379-fig-0003]E). Furthermore, the ANAC005‐GFP transgenic plants show a bigger angle between inflorescence stem and pedicle (Figure [jipb12379-fig-0004]A, C). When expressed using the CaMV 35S promoter, ANAC005 causes similar dwarf phenotypes as driven by ANAC005 promoter (Figure S2). Increasing ANAC005 expression caused dwarf phenotypes (A) Three‐week‐old plants grown under long‐day conditions. Scale bar = 2cm. (B) GUS‐stained leaf petiole of 3‐week‐old plants grown in soil.

We generated ANAC005 knockdown plants through artificial microRNA and RNA interference. But no phenotype was detected in the transgenic plant. With eight homologous genes in the subfamily (Ooka et al. [jipb12379-bib-0031]), ANAC005 is likely to have redundant functions with its homologs. We thus adopted the SRDX chimeric repressor method to study ANAC005 function (Hiratsu et al. [jipb12379-bib-0010], [jipb12379-bib-0011], [jipb12379-bib-0012]). Full‐length coding sequence of ANAC005 was fused to the SRDX transcription repression domain (ANAC005‐SRDX) and expressed in transgenic Arabidopsis using the CaMV 35S promoter. To our surprise, the 35S:ANAC005‐SRDX transgenic plants show no obvious morphological phenotype. Since ANAC005 is preferentially expressed in the vascular bundle, we investigated whether ANAC005 regulates vascular development. We performed sectioning and microscopic analysis of the influorescence stems of both ProANAC005:ANAC005‐GUS and 35S:ANAC005‐SRDX plants. As shown in Figure [jipb12379-fig-0005]A–D, the ProANAC005: ANAC005‐GUS plants showed reduced xylem differentiation, whereas the 35S:ANAC005‐SRDX plants showed increased xylem development. Consistent with the altered xylem development, the lignin content was increased in the 35S:ANAC005‐SRDX plants but reduced in the ProANAC005:ANAC005‐GUS plants (Figure [jipb12379-fig-0005]E). ANAC005 inhibits xylem differentiation (A‐D) Resin‐embedded transverse sections of the basal portion of the inflorescence stems of wild type (A) and ProANAC005::ANAC005‐GUS plants (B), wild type (C) and 35S:ANAC005‐SRDX plants (D).

(F, G) Relative expression level of genes involved in lignin synthesis from 7‐day‐old plants (F) and genes related to vascular development from stem of 5‐week‐old plants (G) of wild type and transgenic plants. We further analyzed vascular‐related genes in the inflorescence stem of the transgenic plants by qRT‐PCR. These genes include lignin synthesis genes (CAD4, CCOAOMT1, COMT1, FAH1), cambium marker (EXPA9 and ANT) (Gray‐Mitsumune et al. [jipb12379-bib-0009]; Schrader et al. [jipb12379-bib-0035]), phloem marker (AHA3 and RTM1) (DeWitt and Sussman [jipb12379-bib-0006]; Chisholm et al. [jipb12379-bib-0002]), primary cell wall cellulose synthesis genes (CESA1, CESA3 and CESA6) (Desprez et al. [jipb12379-bib-0005]), and secondary cell wall cellulose synthesis genes (CESA4 and CESA8) (Taylor et al. [jipb12379-bib-0038]). As shown in Figure [jipb12379-fig-0005]F, CAD4 expression was highly increased in the 35S:ANAC005‐SRDX plants, but decreased in two ProANAC005: ANAC005‐GFP lines, consistent with the alteration of lignin content and xylem development in these plants. Expression levels of CCOAOMT1, COMT1, FAH1 were also increased in the 35S:ANAC005‐SRDX plants, but not obviously altered in the ProANAC005:ANAC005‐GFP plants. All these results support that ANAC005 regulates lignin synthesis and xylem differentiation. Interestingly, genes related to cambium, phloem and primary cell wall were downregulated, while genes related to the secondary cell wall were upregulated in the ProANAC005:ANAC005‐GFP plants compared to wild type (Figure [jipb12379-fig-0005]G).
!~MM~! Arabidopsis thaliana ecotype Columbia‐0, and transgenic plants obtained in this study were grown at 22°C under white light (16‐h light/8‐h dark cycles) either on half‐strength MS medium or in the soil. Arabidopsis seeds were sterilized with 75% ethanol plus 0.01% Triton X‐100 for 15 min, then rinsed with 95% ethanol, and dried in the hood. The surface‐sterilized seeds were sown on 0.7% phytoagar plates containing half‐strength MS medium and 1% sucrose. The plates were kept at 4°C for 3 d and exposed to white light for 2 h before being transferred into the dark. Leaves, inflorescence stem, and silique were photographed and petioles, inflorescence stem, and angle between inflorescence and pedicle were measured using Image J software (http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/). To obtain the overexpression vector of ANAC005, a 1,609‐bp genomic fragment containing full‐length ANAC005 open reading frame was amplified by PCR and then cloned into the BamHI and KpnI sites of the pSN1301 binary vector to place ANAC005 under the control of the CaMV 35S promoter. The primer sequence used was 5′‐CGGGATCCATGGCGAATCCGGTGGGTTT‐3′ and 5′‐GGGGTACCTCATGTTCTTAGGTGAATTTTCTTGAC‐3′. To get localized expression of ANAC005, 2,676‐bp/2,679‐bp (containing terminator codon) genomic segment containing promoter and gene sequence was amplified by PCR and ligated into pENTRTM/SD/D‐TOPO vector, and then ligated into pMDC163 and C3 by recombinant clone. The primer sequence used was 5′‐CACCAGTATCACAACTATGGGTCTGACT‐3′ and 5′‐TGTTCTTAGGTGAATTTTCTTGAC‐3′; 5′‐CACCAGTATCACAACTATGGGTCTGACT‐3′ and 5′‐CTATGTTCTTAGGTGAATTTTCTTGAC‐3′. The 35S:ANAC005‐GFP, 35S:ANAC005(1‐272)‐GFP, 35S:ANAC005(1‐302)‐GFP, 35S:ANAC005(1‐332)‐GFP, 35S:ANAC005(1‐342)‐GFP, and 35S:ANAC005(1‐352)‐GFP fusion construct was generated by inserting a full‐length ANAC005 cDNA without stop codon, a 816 bp cDNA segment without 270 bp segment in the 3′ terminal, a 906 bp cDNA segment without 180 bp cDNA segment in the 3′ terminal, a 996 bp cDNA segment without 90 bp segment in the 3′ terminal, a 1,026 bp cDNA segment without 60 bp in the 3′ terminal, or a 1,056 bp cDNA segment without 30 bp in the 3′ terminal into pENTRTM/SD/D‐TOPO vector, and then ligated into pMDC83 by recombinant clone. The forward primer was 5′‐CACCATGGCGAATCCGGTGGGTTT‐3′ and the reverse primers were 5′‐TGTTCTTAGGTGAATTTTCTTGAC‐3′, 5′‐TGTATCATCCTGTGAAAGAAAC‐3′, 5′‐TTTGTTCTTGATCGTCTCTTGAC‐3′, 5′‐ATGCTCACCAATCTCAGTCCCTTG‐3′, 5′‐TGAGTTAGGAGATTCCTGCAAG‐3′, and 5′‐AGTTGTTGCAGAAATCGGATCAG‐3′. To knock down ANAC005 in Arabidopsis using RNAi, a specific sequence was amplified from wild type Arabidopsis genomic DNA with primers 5′‐GGGGTACCACTAGTAACACGAGCCATGTCGATG‐3′ and 5′‐CGGGATCCGAGCTCATGTTCTTAGGTGAATTTTCTTG‐3′. This fragment was first digested by BamHI and KpnI for the reverse insert to vector pTCK309. The forward insert was generated by SpeI and SacI digestion. To get the dominant repressor of ANAC005, the full‐length cDNA sequence was amplified with primers 5′‐CGGGATCCATGGCGAATCCGGTGGGTTT‐3′ and 5′‐GGACTAGTTGTTCTTAGGTGAATTTTCTTGAC‐3′. Then the segment is ligated into p35SSRDX vector between BamHI and SpeI sites. The constructs were transformed into the Agrobacterium tumefactions strain GV3101 and then introduced into Arabidopsis thaliana plants via floral dip method. Total RNA was extracted using the Trizol reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, California, USA). About 500 ng RNA was reverse‐transcribed by AMV reverse transcriptase (Takara Biotechnology, Dalian, China) following the manufacture's instruction. Quantitative RT‐PCR analyses were carried out on ABI7500 (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, California, USA) by using SYBR Green reagent (Toyobo, Osaka, Japan). Three biological repeats and three technical repeats were performed in each treatment. The UBC30 gene was used as internal reference for all the qRT‐PCR analysis. The histochemical GUS assays were performed in a staining solution containing 0.5 mg/mL 5‐bromo‐4‐chloro‐3‐indolyl glucuronide (X‐Gluc) in 0.1 M Na2HPO4, pH 7.0, 10 mM Na2EDTA, 0.5 mM potassium ferricyanide/ ferrocyanide, and 0.06% Triton X‐100 (Jefferson et al. 1987). Samples were infiltrated under vacuum for 10 min and then incubated at 37°C overnight. The staining buffer was removed, and the samples were cleared in 70% ethanol. All observations by light microscopy were made with the Olympus BX51 microscope system. Arabidopsis stems were fixed overnight in FAA buffer (3.7% formalin, 5% acetic acid, 50% alcohol). Samples were embedded in Spurr's resin (SPI‐CHEM) and sectioned to about 0.5ìm. The microsections were stained with 0.05% toluidine blue‐O (Sigma‐Aldrich) before imaging under a microscope (Zeiss Imager M2).
