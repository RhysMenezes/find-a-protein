!~ABS~! The Arabidopsis double pore K + channel KCO1 was fused to green fluorescent protein and expressed in tobacco protoplasts. Microscopic analysis revealed a bright green fluorescence at the vacuolar membrane. RT-PCR experiments showed that KCO1 is expressed in the mesophyll. Vacuoles from Arabidopsis wild-type and kco1 knockout plants were isolated for patch-clamp analyses. Currents mediated by s low-activating v acuolar (SV) channels of mesophyll cell vacuoles were significantly smaller in kco1 plants compared to the wild-type. This shows that KCO1 is involved in the formation of SV channels.
!~RES~! Transfected tobacco BY2 protoplasts were identified by the green fluorescence of the expressed KCO1–GFP fusion protein. Tobacco cells expressing KCO1–GFP show bright staining of vacuolar membranes ( [FIG1] ). To prove whether KCO1–GFP was embedded in the vacuolar membrane, tobacco cells were ruptured to release intact vacuoles ( [FIG1] ). This was accomplished by either flushing distilled water from a micro-pipette onto the isolated protoplasts [BIB26] or by applying a harsh suction pulse by a patch-pipette filled with bath solution [BIB14] . Images of vacuoles emerging from transfected tobacco cells always showed a pronounced green fluorescence of the vacuolar membrane ( [FIG1] ; n >10), indicating that KCO1 is indeed inserted into this membrane. Vacuolar GFP fluorescence was also detected in epidermal cells following ballistic bombardment of Arabidopsis leaves using CaMV35S::KCO1-GFP (Meyerhoff, Würzburg, unpublished). Therefore, it is highly unlikely that the observed KCO1 localization results from mistargeting as frequently observed for plant membrane proteins (e.g. the TIP aquaporins) expressed in heterologous systems [BIB27] . To search for an insertion mutant in the KCO1 gene, we used a reverse genetic approach. Thereby, a transposon-mutagenized Arabidopsis population was screened with KCO1 - and En-1 -specific primers. We first found an En-1 transposon located about 1.5 kb upstream of the ATG translational start codon, which can not be expected to cause a strong reduction in mRNA content. In order to obtain a mutant which lacks KCO1 , we screened for an excision–reinsertion event of En-1 . Among 1800 progeny plants, a single mutant plant ( kco1-7 ) was obtained. The transposon had inserted into position nt 757–759, leading to a duplication of Ala 253 , thereby disrupting the open reading frame ( [FIG2] ). Homozygous progeny of this plant was used for further studies. Quantitative RT-PCR was used to compare KCO transcripts between leaves and roots. Thereby, KCO1 and KCO6 were found in relatively high concentrations in the leaf only ( [FIG3] ). In root, KCO transcripts were less abundant. Following enzymatic digestion, mesophyll and guard-cell protoplasts were separated. Mesophyll cells were dominated by KCO1 and KCO6 transcripts with a three-fold higher expression level of KCO1 compared to guard cells ( [FIG3] ). The number of KCO6 transcripts in mesophyll cells was four times smaller than that of KCO1. In contrast, KCO6 levels in guard cells were as high as those of KCO1. Thus, KCO1 and KCO6 are expected to dominate KCO-type currents in mesophyll vacuoles. Accordingly, mesophyll vacuoles from kco1-7 plants should be significantly reduced in the current generated by KCO1 channels. The patch-clamp technique was used to study ion currents of mesophyll vacuoles from Arabidopsis wild-type and kco1-7 plants to address the question whether KCO1 corresponds to either FV or SV channel activities. Without Ca 2+ in the bath solution, typical instantaneous outward currents were elicited by positive voltage-pulses. These FV currents did not significantly differ between vacuoles from wild-type and from kco1-7 plants ( [FIG4] ). With symmetrical 2 mM Ca 2+ , characteristic whole-vacuole SV currents became measurable. SV currents recorded from wild-type and kco1-7 plants appeared qualitatively similar (voltage dependence, kinetics, Ca 2+ requirement, [FIG5] ). When comparing the current densities, however, SV currents from kco1 plants were smaller than with wild-type vacuoles ( [FIG6] ). The medians, 2.2 A/m 2 for the wild-type and 0.55 A/m 2 for kco1 , differed by a factor of four, and a t -test (of the untransformed data as well as of the logarithmic data) and a Kolmogorov–Smirnov test clearly show that SV current amplitudes from kco1 plants are significantly smaller than those from wild-type plants. It should be noted that KCO1 contains a putative 14-3-3 binding site and that this peptide was shown to block the SV channel [BIB28] . This suggests that the KCO1 protein contributes to the formation of functional SV channels. KCO6 transcripts represent 25% when compared to KCO1 ( [FIG3] ). Assuming that KCO6 is located in the vacuolar membrane too, it is tempting to speculate that KCO6 accounts for the background SV current in kco1-7 . Therefore, future studies taking advantage of kco1-kco6 double mutants together with proteomic approaches to identify the proteins interacting with KCO1 and KCO6 will gain new insights into the role and structure of the SV channel. Compared to KCO1-mediated whole-cell currents in KCO1 expressing insect cells [BIB16] , whole-vacuole SV currents show some similarities but also some striking differences. The SV channel is activated by increasing cytosolic Ca 2+ but requires higher free Ca 2+ concentrations and the Ca 2+ dependence is not as steep [BIB6] as measured with KCO1-expressing insect cells [BIB9 BIB16] . Moreover, increasing vacuolar calcium shifts the voltage dependence of the SV channel in the opposite direction compared to cytosolic Ca 2+ changes [BIB10 BIB15] . The external concentration of divalent cations, however, does not affect KCO1 [BIB16] . The SV channel hardly discriminates between K + and Na + [BIB6 BIB26] , whereas KCO1 has a six-fold higher permeability for K + [BIB16] . In contrast to KCO1, the SV channel is much less sensitive to Ba 2+ blockage and the block is readily reversible [BIB26 BIB29] . In order to explain these discrepancies, isolated Arabidopsis mesophyll vacuoles were analyzed under the same ionic conditions as those originally used for recording KCO1-mediated whole-cell currents in KCO1-expressing insect cells [BIB16] . This was done with the corresponding bath solution in the bath (and the pipette solution in the pipette) as described by Czempinski et al. [BIB16] , and, in addition, with bath and pipette solutions reciprocally exchanged. Under both conditions no whole-vacuole currents resembling KCO1-mediated currents [BIB16] could be recorded. It will be interesting to find out why KCO1-mediated K + currents recorded in insect cells are so different from vacuolar SV currents.
!~MM~! For the construction of the KCO1–GFP fusion, KCO1 cDNA was amplified by PCR using pBluescript KCO1 (P.S., Ph.D. Thesis, University Cologne, Germany) as a template. The forward primer (5′-AGA CTC GAG GCA TCC ATG TCT TCG G-3′) contains a Xho I site and the reverse primer (5′-AGG TGA CAT GTA CCT TTG AAT CTG AGA CG-3′), a BspLU11I site, and mutated the KCO1 stop codon TAA to TAC. The isolated PCR fragment was digested with Xho I and BspLU11I and the resulting 743-bp fragment was subcloned into the vector pCATSgfp (kindly provided by Guido Jach, Max-Planck-Institute for Plant Breeding, Germany) digested with Xho I and Nco I, thereby replacing a translation-enhancing element. This vector contains a codon-optimized GFP S65C mutant gene [BIB17] under the control of the cauliflower mosaic virus CaMV-35S promoter and an additional translation-enhancing element of tobacco etch virus (the basic vector is described in [BIB18] ). Transient expression in tobacco BY2 protoplasts and microscopic analysis were performed as described by Bischoff et al. [BIB19] . The KCO1::En1 mutant was identified by reverse genetic screening of an En-1 -mutagenized collection of Arabidopsis plants. PCR-based screens were performed as described [BIB20] . The following two primer combinations specific for the KCO1 gene and the En-1 transposon were used: (1) KCO1-14 (5′-CTG CTA GGA CGC CAT TGT TAC CCA CTG AG-3′) and En-8130 (5′-GAG CGT CGG TCC CCA CAC TTC TAT AC-3′); and (2) En-205 (5′-AGA AGC ACG ACG GCT GTA GAA TAG GA-3′) and KCO1-900 (5′-AGC TGC TTC GAG ATC ATT GTT TGT GAT TC-3′). For RT-PCR experiments, total RNA from Arabidopsis tissues was isolated using the RNeasy Plant Mini Kit and mRNA was purified twice with the Dynabeads mRNA Direct kit (Dynal, Oslo) to minimize DNA contaminations. Guard-cell and mesophyll protoplasts were prepared as described [BIB21 BIB22] and directly purified with the Dynabeads mRNA Direct kit. First-strand cDNA and quantitative RT-PCR was performed as described before [BIB23] using a LightCycler (Roche). The following K + channel-specific primers were used: KCO1fwd (5′-GTT GGC ACG ATT TTC-3′), KCO1rev (5′-GCT TCG CAA GAT GAT-3′), KCO2fwd (5′-GAT CGG GAC AAA GTG-3′), KCO2rev (5′-ACG CAG CCA TTA CAG-3′), KCO3fwd (5′-GAC AAT GCG TAT CAG-3′), KCO3rev (5′-GCG GTG GTT AAA TCA-3′), KCO4fwd (5′-TCA CAT TGC CGA AGA-3′), KCO4rev (5′-ACT GCG AAG CCT CTC-3′), KCO5fwd (5′-AGA CGA CAA AGA AGA-3′), KCO5rev (5′-CCG GTG AGA ATC ATA-3′), KCO6fwd (5′-ACC CAA TTC GTC AAA A-3′), KCO6rev (5′-CCG CTT AGC AGA GTC T-3′). The GenBank accession numbers are as follows: KCO1 ( X97323 ), KCO2 ( AJ131641 ), KCO3 ( AJ010873 ), KCO4 (cf. [BIB24] ), KCO5 ( AJ243456 ), KCO6 (cf. [BIB24] ) and Arabidopsis actins (cf. [BIB25] ). cDNA quantities were calculated by using LIGHTCYCLER 3.5 (Roche). All quantifications were normalized to actin cDNA fragments amplified by ACTfwd (5′-GGT GAT GGT GTG TCT-3′) and ACTrev (5′-ACT GAG CAC AAT GTT AC-3′). To enable detection of contaminating genomic DNA, the primers for KCO1, KCO2 and KCO3 were selected to flank introns. All kits were used according to the manufacturers’ protocols. Fluorescent images were taken with a Zeiss Axiovert 135 illuminated at 472 nm by Polychrome II (T.I.L.L. Photonics, Martinsried, Germany) or a Zeiss LSM 410 with a blue (488 nm) argon laser. For the fluorescence channel, a bandpass filter 515–565 nm was used with the 40× C-Apochromat water-immersion objective. The xy -resolution was set to 0.33 μm per pixel while the z -resolution was about 1.6 μm. A. thaliana (Col-0) was grown in a temperature-controlled growth chamber (16 h light, 8 h dark). From protoplasts isolated from mesophyll cells [BIB21] , a fresh vacuole was mechanically isolated within the measuring chamber for each patch-clamp measurement [BIB14] . Patch-clamp recordings were performed as described [BIB14] . For recordings on vacuolar membranes, the pipette (vacuolar interior) contained (in mM): 100 KCl, 2 CaCl 2 , 5 HEPES/Tris, pH 7.5, adjusted to 400 mOsm with sorbitol. The bathing medium was either the same for recording of SV channels or 2 mM CaCl 2 were substituted by 5 mM EGTA to record FV channels.
