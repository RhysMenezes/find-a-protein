!~ABS~! Root hairs are responsible for water and nutrient uptake from the soil and their growth is responsive to biotic and abiotic changes in their environment. Root hair expansion is a polarized process requiring secretory and endosomal pathways that deliver and recycle plasma membrane and cell wall material to the growing root hair tip. In this paper, the role of VTI13 (AT3G29100), a member of the VTI vesicular soluble NSF attachment receptor (SNARE) gene family in Arabidopsis thaliana, in root hair growth is described. Genetic analysis and complementation of the vti13 root hair phenotypes of Arabidopsis thaliana were first used to assess the role of VTI13 in root hair growth. Transgenic lines expressing a green fluorescent protein (GFP)–VTI13 construct were used to characterize the intracellular localization of VTI13 in root hairs using confocal microscopy and immunotransmission electron microscopy. VTI13 was characterized and genetic analysis used to show that its function is required for root hair growth. Expression of a GFP–VTI13 fusion in the vti13 mutant background was shown to complement the vti13 root hair phenotype. GFP–VTI13 localized to both the vacuole membrane and a mobile endosomal compartment. The function of VTI13 was also required for the localization of SYP41 to the trans-Golgi network. Immunohistochemical analysis indicated that cell wall organization is altered in vti13 root hairs and root epidermal cells. These results show that VTI13 plays a unique role in endosomal trafficking pathways associated with the vacuole within root hairs and is essential for the maintenance of cell wall organization and root hair growth in arabidopsis.
!~RES~! The expression of the structural cell wall protein proline-rich protein 3 (PRP3; AT3G62680) is linked to root hair development ([MCU041C7]), where it is localized to root hair cell walls and is required for root hair growth in arabidopsis (Hu et al., unpubl. res.). Microarray analysis of the T-DNA insertion mutant prp3 identified VTI13((At3G29100) as a gene whose expression is up-regulated in roots of prp3 when compared with wild-type roots (Table [MCU041TB1]). RT-PCR analysis was used to confirm the microarray results (Fig. [MCU041F1]A) and showed that VTI13 transcripts were detected at very low levels in wild-type roots but were detected at higher levels in roots of the prp3 mutant (Fig. [MCU041F1]A, Supplementary Data Fig. S1). These results suggest that VTI13 expression may be sensitive to root hair cell wall structure.

Results are from one representative experiment and are given as the mean ± s.e. Scale bars: (B–G) = 50 μm. To determine if VTI13 was required for root hair growth, we analysed vti13 (SALK_075261), which contains a T-DNA insertion in the second exon of the VTI13 gene. Using RT-PCR, we could not detect any VTI13 transcript in the vti13 mutant, indicating that this line is a null mutant (Fig. [MCU041F1]A). In contrast, we found no discernable difference in the amount of transcript encoding VTI11 or VTI12, two other VTI family members, in the vti13 mutant (Fig. [MCU041F1]A, Table [MCU041TB1]). To determine if the loss of VTI13 resulted in root hair growth phenotypes, vti13 and wild-type seedlings were grown for 5 days on MS medium and examined using bright-field microscopy. In comparison with wild-type, the root hairs on vti13 seedlings were shorter and exhibited branching (Fig. [MCU041F1]B, C). We then asked whether vti13 root hair growth was sensitive to changes in the growth environment by comparing vti13 root hair growth with that of wild-type seedlings in response to two other medium conditions. When grown in the presence of 200 mm mannitol, vti13 seedling root hairs exhibited a much more severe root hair branching phenotype than that detected in wild-type or in vti13 grown in the absence of mannitol (Fig. [MCU041F1]D, E). These results indicate that VTI13 is required for polarized growth in root hairs and that the vti13 phenotype can be enhanced by osmotic stress. In contrast, when wild-type and vti13 seedlings were grown on MS medium at pH 5·0, root hair length of wild-type seedlings was similar to that observed at pH 6, whereas the root hairs of vti13 seedlings were longer and did not branch (Fig. [MCU041F1]F, G), suggesting that low pH may be able to compensate for factors altering vti13 root hair growth. To further confirm that the vti13 root hair mutant phenotypes were due to the absence of VTI13, we examined root hair growth in T3 transgenic seedlings expressing either a 35S:GFP–VTI13 or a VTI13:GFP–VTI13 construct in the vti13 mutant background (Fig. [MCU041F2]). Four to five T3 lines that were BASTA-resistant and showed similar expression in the vti13 and wild-type backgrounds were identified for each construct. From these initial studies, one transgenic line expressing either 35S:GFP–VTI13 or VTI13:GFP–VTI13 was chosen for further analyses. Expression of the GFP–VTI13 protein fusion driven by either promoter complemented the vti13 mutant root hair phenotype (Fig. [MCU041F2]C, D). Additionally, root hair growth was not affected by expression of the 35S:GFP–VTI13 construct in wild-type seedlings (Fig. [MCU041F2]E). Lastly, when the complemented vti13 lines were grown in the presence of 200 mm mannitol, their root hair growth was indistinguishable from that of wild-type root hairs (Supplementary Data Fig. S2). These results indicate that the GFP–VTI13 constructs complemented the vti13 root hair phenotypes and that VTI13 is essential for normal root hair growth. Fig. 2.Mutant vti13 can be complemented by the GFP–VTI13 fusion protein. Seedlings were grown for 5 days on 1× MS medium, pH 6.

To identify the intracellular compartments within which VTI13 functions, we characterized GFP–VTI13 subcellular localization in root epidermal cells and root hair cells using confocal scanning laser microscopy (CSLM). While both constructs complemented vti13, the 35S:GFP–VTI13-expressing lines yielded higher-contrast images and were used for all subsequent CSLM experiments except when stated otherwise. GFP–VTI13 was observed in two distinct subcellular locations: the membrane of a large internal compartment and smaller compartments that were punctate and mobile (Fig. [MCU041F3]). We also observed GFP–VTI13 fluorescence in vacuolar ‘bulb’-like structures (Fig. [MCU041F3]A, B), which have been characterized previously with respect to the localization of family member VTI11 within vacuolar membranes ([MCU041C45]; [MCU041C47]et al., 2011). VTI13 localized to these structures in both epidermal cells at the root tip and in root hairs (Fig. [MCU041F3]A, B).

Scale bars: (A–D) = 5 μm; (E) = 10 μm. Due to its intracellular localization in suspension cultured cells ([MCU041C54]et al., 2004), we wanted to confirm that VTI13 localized to the vacuolar membrane in root hairs and determine if the VTI13 punctate structures represented a class of endosomes. To confirm that the large, VTI13-labelled internal membrane corresponded to the vacuole, transgenic lines expressing 35S:GFP–VTI13 in a wild-type background were crossed with a transgenic line expressing a resident vacuolar membrane protein, YFP-γTIP ([MCU041C37]et al., 2007). GFP–VTI13 was found to co-localize with the vacuolar marker YFP-γTIP at the vacuole membrane only and not in the small, mobile GFP–VTI13 compartments in growing root hairs (Fig. [MCU041F3]E). These results support a role for VTI13 in the transport or docking of vesicles at the vacuole membrane during root hair growth. To investigate the nature of the small, punctate VTI13-labelled internal structures, we treated GFP–VTI13 expressing seedlings with the lipophilic dye FM4-64, which is used to label the plasma membrane and internal membranes involved in endosomal trafficking ([MCU041C16]et al., 2000). When these seedlings were labelled with FM4-64 for 2–3 min, no co-labelling between FM4-64 and GFP–VTI13 was observed in root hairs (Fig. [MCU041F3]B), indicating that GFP–VTI13 did not localize within the plasma membrane. However, after longer treatments of 15–20 min with FM4-64, we did observe co-localization in some of the GFP–VTI13 mobile fraction within small puncta near the root hair tip (Fig. [MCU041F3]D), suggesting that this might represent a population of endosomal compartments. In these experiments, a similar pattern of localization for GFP–VTI13 was observed in both root tip epidermal cells and root hairs (Fig. [MCU041F3]A, B), indicating that VTI13 localization is similar in these two cell types and that VTI13 is a component of intracellular membranes. Endocytosis and vesicular trafficking are dependent on the structure of the actin cytoskeleton but not on microtubule organization ([MCU041C3]et al., 2002; [MCU041C17]et al., 2003). To investigate whether the mobility of the GFP–VTI13-labelled compartments required an intact actin cytoskeleton, we treated 5-day-old seedlings with 100 nm Latrunculin B, an actin-depolymerizing agent, for 30 min. Root hairs were then examined for the mobility of GFP–VTI13-labelled compartments using CSLM. When seedlings were treated with vehicle alone there was dynamic movement of both the GFP–VTI13-labelled vacuole membrane and the punctate compartments, which moved over long distances along the shaft of the root hair (Fig. [MCU041F4]A, Supplementary Data Video S1). Seedlings treated with 10 μm oryzalin, a molecule that depolymerizes microtubules, had no effect on the movement of the VTI13-labelled vacuolar membrane or mobile compartments in root hairs when compared with DMSO-treated seedlings (Fig. [MCU041F4]B, Supplementary Data Video S2). In contrast, treatment of root hairs with Latrunculin B resulted in the loss of long-distance movement of the small cytoplasmic puncta as well as dynamic changes in the vacuole membrane (Fig. [MCU041F4]C, Supplementary Data Video S3). These data demonstrate that the mobility of the VTI13-labelled vacuole membrane and the small, mobile VTI13-containing compartments requires an intact actin cytoskeleton during root hair growth. Fig. 4.VTI13-labelled compartment mobility requires the actin cytoskeleton. The distribution of VTI13-labelled compartments in the vti13-complemented lines was diffuse throughout the root hairs of 5-day-old seedlings treated with (A) 100 nm DMSO or (B) 10 μm oryzalin, and became aggregated after treatment with (C) 100 nm Latrunculin B. All treatments were performed at root temperature for 2 h. Scale bars: (A–C) = 10 μm. VTI13-labelled compartment mobility requires the actin cytoskeleton.

All treatments were performed at root temperature for 2 h. Scale bars: (A–C) = 10 μm. As a first step in determining the identity of the mobile and punctate GFP–VTI13-labelled compartments in root hairs, we treated seedlings with the fungal toxin BFA. BFA has been shown to selectively inhibit GTP exchange factors (GEFs), which activate ADP ribosylation factors (ARFs) and are required for vesicle trafficking between endosomal compartments in eukaryotes ([MCU041C41]et al., 1999; [MCU041C44]et al., 2008; [MCU041C28]et al., 2009). In plants there are BFA-sensitive and BFA-resistant ARF–GEFs whose localization in different endosomal compartments can be species- and tissue-specific ([MCU041C42]et al., 2007, [MCU041C43]; [MCU041C29]). While the ARF–GEF GNOM-LIKE1 (GNL1) that is associated with the Golgi apparatus is considered BFA-resistant in arabidopsis roots, concentrations of BFA greater than 50 μm induce a morphological aggregation of TGN containing SYP61–GFP in arabidopsis root protoplasts ([MCU041C29]et al., 2011). Although the exact mechanisms behind the variety of BFA effects in plants are still being defined, it is well accepted that BFA provides a tool to distinguish between different classes of endosomal compartments. We analysed GFP–VTI13-labelled compartment sensitivity to BFA by treating 5-day-old seedlings with vehicle alone or with a low (10 μm) or intermediate (50 μm) concentration of BFA for 10 min. The seedlings treated with 10 μm BFA for 10 min showed no discernable difference in GFP–VTI13 organization or localization when compared with seedlings treated with vehicle alone, particularly with respect to the mobility of VTI13-labelled compartments (Fig. [MCU041F5]A, B, Supplementary Data Videos S4, S5). In contrast, when seedlings were treated with 50 μm BFA for 10 min, the GFP–VTI13 compartments became larger and less mobile (Fig. [MCU041F5]C, Supplementary Data Video S6). Interestingly, the VTI13-labelled compartments did not co-localize with the endosomal trafficking tracer FM4-64 after BFA treatment. Additionally, when seedlings were treated with 100 μm BFA for 2 h, VTI13-labelled compartments were found to be distinct from those labelled with FM4-64 (Supplementary Data Fig. S3) and were characteristic of the ‘BFA compartments’ thought to be composed of early endosomes and TGN-derived compartments ([MCU041C59]et al., 2003; [MCU041C17]et al., 2003). This contrasts with the BFA compartments that did label with FM4-64 in these experiments, which are likely due to the accumulation of endocytosed FM4-64-labelled plasma membrane ([MCU041C11]et al., 2006; [MCU041C43]et al., 2012). Together, these data suggest that VTI13 localizes to early endosome or TGN compartments that are sensitive to BFA in a similar manner to that which has been observed in arabidopsis root protoplasts ([MCU041C29]et al., 2011). Fig. 5.VTI13-labelled compartments are sensitive to BFA. Scanning laser confocal micrographs of 35S:GFP–VTI13 (green) seedlings treated with FM4-64 (red) and (A) DMSO, (B) 10 μm BFA or (C) 50 μm BFA for 10 min only exhibited sensitivity at higher concentrations of BFA. Still frames from each treatment were taken from live images of treated root hairs (Supplementary Data Videos S4–S6). Arrows point to VTI13-labelled compartments whose mobility was not altered by treatment with (A) DMSO or (B) 10 μm BFA, but became swollen and less mobile when treated with (C) 50 μm BFA.

To provide additional support for the localization of VTI13 to early endosomes or TGN compartments, TEM was used with immunogold labelling to visualize the subcellular localization of GFP–VTI13 in root hairs of 5-day-old arabidopsis seedlings. When root hairs of vti13-complemented lines expressing 35S:GFP–VTI13 were labelled with an anti-GFP antibody, gold particles were seen at the vacuole membrane, the Golgi apparatus and the periphery of the Golgi stacks (Fig. [MCU041F6]). These data, together with our previous analysis of GFP–VTI13 localization, support a localization of VTI13 within the Golgi and a population of early endosomes or the TGN in arabidopsis root hair cells. Fig. 6.VTI13 localizes to the post-Golgi and trans-Golgi network or early endosomes in arabidopsis root hair cells.

Scale bars: (A–C) = 500 nm. SYP41 is a resident TGN protein and has been used as a marker for TGN compartments in plant cells ([MCU041C48]et al., 2001a, b; [MCU041C54]et al., 2004). To investigate if VTI13 was required for TGN function or organization, we compared SYP41 labelling in roots and root hairs of both vti13 and wild-type seedlings using immunolabelling and electron microscopy. Interestingly, when we used monoclonal antibodies against SYP41 to label vti13 root hair sections, we found that the gold particles labelled the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) as well as the TGN, whereas in wild-type root hairs SYP41 labelling was restricted to the Golgi apparatus and TGN (Fig. [MCU041F7]). These data indicate that VTI13 function is important for localization to and/or maintenance of SYP41 within the TGN and suggest that TGN trafficking may be compromised in the vti13 mutant. Fig. 7.VTI13 function is important for TGN compartment organization. (A) SYP41 antibodies labelled the Golgi and TGN compartments of wild-type root hairs.

Scale bars: (A) = 400 nm; (B, C) = 200 nm. Our initial observation of altered root hair morphology in the vti13 mutant suggests that cell wall organization or structure may be affected by VTI13 expression and function. To test this directly, we used the antibody LM15 ([MCU041C32]et al., 2008) to label xyloglucan epitopes in root hair cell walls of wild-type and vti13 mutant seedlings. We hypothesized that if cell wall organization were altered in vti13 root hairs, we would see a change in LM15 labelling when compared with labelling patterns of wild-type root hairs. Using CSLM, we observed ubiquitous LM15 distribution in the walls of wild-type root epidermal cells (Fig. [MCU041F8]A) and root hairs (Fig. [MCU041F8]C). In the vti13 mutant, LM15 labelling was minimal along the root epidermis (Fig. [MCU041F8]B) and in root hairs (Fig. [MCU041F8]D). These results suggest that xyloglucan may be underrepresented in vti13 mutant cell walls or that the organization of vti13 cell walls has been altered in such a way that the epitope recognized by LM15 is no longer accessible to the antibody. These results support the hypothesis that VTI13 function and/or the pathways in which it functions are important for root hair cell wall organization or structure and that the cell wall of vti13 root hairs is altered from that of wild-type root hairs. Fig. 8.The vti13 mutant seedling root epidermal cells and root hairs exhibit altered cell wall organization. Confocal microscopy analysis of LM15 labelling in wild-type seedlings shows extensive and uniform distribution of xyloglucan in the cell wall of (A) root epidermal cells and (C) root hairs. Conversely, the vti13 mutant showed little to no LM15 labelling of the cell wall of (B) root epidermal cells and (D) root hairs. (E, F, H) Bright-field images of root hairs in (C, D and G), respectively. (G) Secondary antibodies alone did not label the cell wall of wild-type root hairs.

The observation that cell wall organization is altered in the vti13 mutant suggests that VTI13 function may be directly or indirectly involved in cell wall metabolism. Based on our original observation that VTI13 expression is upregulated in the prp3 mutant, we were interested in examining if this overexpression might contribute to changes in cell wall structure that would result in the short, branched prp3 root hair phenotype. If this were the case, then a loss of VTI13 function in the prp3 mutant background might result in suppression of the prp3 root hair phenotype. To address this genetically we analysed root hair growth in the prp3 vti13 double mutant. We found the root hair phenotypes characteristic of the single-mutant parents were partially rescued in the prp3 vti13 double mutant (Fig. [MCU041F9]). The LM15 labelling of root hairs that was lost in vti13 was also recovered in the prp3 vti13 double mutant (Fig. [MCU041F9]F–H). Root hairs of the double mutant no longer branched and were of similar length to wild-type root hairs (Fig. [MCU041F9]I). Additionally, when grown in the presence of 200 mm mannitol, the root hairs of the prp3 vti13 double mutant responded much more like those of wild-type seedlings than those associated with either of the single vti13 or prp3 mutants (Fig. [MCU041F10]). These data demonstrate that VTI13 expression in root hairs is important for normal cell wall organization and suggest that its misregulation in the prp3 mutant may contribute a change in cell wall organization that is reflected in the observed defects in root hair growth.

Root hairs of approximately eight to ten seedlings were measured for each genotype. Scale bars: (A–E) = 50 μm; (F) = 40 μm; (G) = 50 μm; (H) = 20 μm. Fig. 10.The prp3 vti13 double mutant was much less sensitive to mannitol in the growth medium when compared with the single mutants and appeared similar in root hair phenotype to wild-type seedlings under both growth conditions. (A, E) Wild type (B, F), prp3, (C, G) vti13 and (D, H) prp3 vti13 double mutants were grown on 1× MS medium (A–D) and 1× MS medium including 200 mm mannitol (E–H). Scale bars: (A–H) = 50 μm.

!~MM~! Arabidopsis thaliana (Columbia-0) was used for all experiments involving wild-type and mutant analysis. Our standard plant growth media for seedlings consisted of 1× Murashige and Skoog (MS) salts, 1 % (w/v) sucrose, 1 × Gamborg's vitamin solution, 5 mm 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid sodium salt, pH 6, and 1·3 % (w/v) agarose (Sigma Chemical, St Louis, MO, USA). Sterilized seeds were grown vertically on plates for 5 days at room temperature under continuous light. Other growth conditions included the addition of 200 mm mannitol to the standard medium and changing the pH of the medium from 6·0 to 5·0. For plants grown in soil, seed was sown in soil (MetroMix 360, Sun Gro Horticulture, Bellevue, WA, USA) and placed in growth chambers (Conviron, Winnipeg, CA, USA) programmed for long-day conditions (16 : 8 h light:dark cycle, 20 °C). Seedlings were grown on our standard medium for 5 days, after which root tissue was harvested for RNA isolation. Approximately 200 roots were pooled per genotype for each condition tested and duplicate analyses were performed. When harvesting the root tissue, the root meristem and mature region of the root were removed such that only the differentiation and elongation zones of the root were collected. Total RNA was isolated using the Qiagen RNeasy Plant Mini Kit protocol and then used in first-strand cDNA synthesis using SuperScript II Reverse Transcriptase according to the standard protocol (Invitrogen). For RT-PCR the VTI13 forward and reverse primers described in Supplementary Data Table S1 were used with the first-strand cDNA templates to amplify gene products using Phusion Taq polymerase (New England Biolabs). A 35S:GFP–VTI13 construct was kindly provided by Dr Masa Sato ([MCU041C54]et al., 2004) and was subcloned into the pENTR/D-TOPO vector (Invitrogen, Grand Island, NY) to use in Gateway cloning. pENTR/35S:GFP–VTI13 (pERL02A) was cloned into the Gateway destination vector pEarleyGate CDS694 ([MCU041C14]et al., 2006), using the LR Clonase II reaction kit (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's directions. Clones containing 35S:GFP–VTI13 in the CDS694 vector were transformed into Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain GV3101, after which the 35S:GFP–VTI13 construct (pERL02) was transformed into arabidopsis using the floral dip method ([MCU041C6]; [MCU041C57]et al., 2006). A 2-kb DNA fragment just upstream of the VTI13 translational start codon and including the 5′-UTR was amplified from genomic DNA using primers that added BamHI and NcoI restriction enzyme sites at the 5′ ends (VTI13pro_F and VTI13pro_R). This PCR product was then subcloned into the pENTR/D-TOPO entry vector (Invitrogen) using the manufacturer's protocol to produce pERL03A. This construct and pERL02 were digested with both BamHI and NcoI and then gel purified to extract the 2-kb VTI13 promoter fragment from pERL03A and the promoterless pERL02 linear plasmid. The VTI13 promoter was inserted upstream of the GFP–VTI13 construct using standard molecular techniques. The VTI13:GFP–VTI13 construct (pERL03) was first transformed into Escherichia coli strain DH5α and then into A. tumefaciens strain GV3101 for the transformation of arabidopsis. Seeds were sterilized and plated on 1× MS medium, pH 6, 1× MS medium, pH 5, or 1× MS medium, pH 6, with the addition of 200 mm mannitol, and grown as described above. To characterize root hair morphology, seedlings were mounted in sterile distilled water or 1× MS liquid medium on glass slides. Images of root hairs were obtained using a Nikon Eclipse TE200 inverted microscope in conjunction with SPOT imaging software (Diagnostic Instruments). Root hair lengths were measured from bright-field images using the calibrated measuring tool in the SPOT imaging software. Statistical analysis (ANOVA) was performed using Prism 6·0. A single T-DNA insertion mutant (SALK_075261) of VTI13 was obtained from the Arabidopsis Biological Research Center (ABRC) stock centre. Primers used for genotyping this mutant are listed in Supplementary Data Table S1 and spanned all of the introns within VTI13. The vti13 mutant was transformed with both the 35S:GFP–VTI13 and VTI13:GFP–VTI13 constructs. Homozygous transgenic lines expressing each VTI13 construct were identified through glufosinate (BASTA) resistance in the T3 generation and then analysed for complementation of the vti13 short, branched root hair phenotype in 5-day-old seedlings germinated on 1× MS solid medium. Root hairs were imaged using bright-field microscopy. The vti13 homozygous null mutant was crossed to a prp3 homozygous null mutant and F1 seed was collected. Individual F2 plants were genotyped using primer sets listed in Supplementary Data Table S1 to identify homozygous prp3 vti13 double mutants. Several prp3 vti13 double mutants from two independent crosses were characterized for their patterns of root hair growth in these studies. Arabidopsis seedlings were grown for 5 days on plates containing 1× MS medium, pH 6, and then transferred to the wells of a 48-well microtitre plate containing 200 μl of DMSO, 100 nm Latrunculin B or 10 μm oryzalin diluted in 1× MS medium, pH 6. Seedlings were incubated for 2 h at room temperature before confocal imaging of root hairs or root epidermal cells expressing 35S:GFP–VTI13. Seedlings were suspended in the treatment medium during imaging. Seedlings were grown for 5 days on 1× MS plates and then incubated with 10 or 50 μm brefeldin A (BFA) diluted in 1× MS medium directly on microscope slides. Seedlings treated with BFA were incubated at room temperature for 10 min before confocal imaging of GFP–VTI13. During imaging, seedlings were mounted in the treatment solutions. Where indicated, the lipophilic dye FM4-64 was added to the BFA treatment solutions at a concentration of 5 μm. To produce plants that co-expressed GFP–VTI13 and yellow fluorescent protein–γ-tonoplast intrinsic protein (YFP-γTIP), a transgenic line expressing 35S:GFP–VTI13 in a wild-type background was crossed with the 35S:YFP-γTIP transgenic line ([MCU041C37]et al., 2007), and heterozygous F1 seedlings were analysed by confocal microscopy. All fluorescent lines were imaged with a Zeiss confocal LSM 510 META laser scanning microscope using a 63× oil immersion objective. The GFP–VTI13 fusion lines were excited with an argon ion laser line main beam splitter of 488 nm and emissions were captured using a 505/530 nm bypass filter. When FM4-64 staining was imaged with the GFP–VTI13 lines, the samples were excited at 488 nm with the argon ion laser with a main beam splitter of 488 nm and an additional splitter of 545 nm. The 505/530 nm bypass filter was used to capture GFP emission and a 650 nm long-pass filter was used to capture the FM4-64 emission. YFP–protein fusions were excited with a main beam splitter of 548/514 nm and emissions were captured with a 530/600 nm bypass filter. Cross-talk between YFP and GFP emission was taken into account by controlling the gain of each bypass filter orientation (as described in [MCU041C2]et al., 2011 and Supplementary Data Fig. S4). The LSM 510 META software was used to acquire images and movies of root hair and epidermal cells. Images were then processed using ImageJ. Roots were fixed in 1 % glutaraldehyde in Sorensen's buffer (EMS, Fort Washington, PA, USA) on ice for 45 min. The roots were subsequently washed three times with cold Sorensen's buffer and separated into two sets. One set was gently post-fixed in 0·8 % osmium tetroxide for 90 min on ice, washed three times with Sorensen's buffer, dehydrated in acetone and infiltrated/embedded in Spurr's Low Viscosity plastic. Polymerization of plastic was at 60 °C for 8 h. The second set of roots was not post-fixed but dehydrated in ethanol and infiltrated/embedded in London Resin. These procedures were performed at 4 °C and polymerization was performed with UV light at 4 °C for 16 h. Sections (60 nm) of roots were obtained using a Reichert Ultracut ultramicrotome and diamond knife. Sections were collected on Formvar-coated nickel slot grids. Immunogold labelling was performed as follows, using monoclonal antibodies against GFP (Invitrogen) or SYP41 (a generous gift from Natasha Raikhel). Grids containing osmicated specimens were treated for 5 min with 5 % H2O2 and then washed with distilled water. All grids were treated with 0·2 % ammonium chloride for 10 min, washed with distilled water and then incubated in a blocking solution consisting of 1 % bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7·2) containing 0·1 % Tween-20 (PBST) for 30 min. Grids were washed and placed on droplets of a solution containing a 1/50 dilution of antibodies (SYP41 or GFP) in PBST for 90 min at 37 °C. After this time, the grids were washed and blocked again as described above. The grids were then incubated in a 1/150 dilution of anti-rabbit antibody in PBST for 90 min at 37 °C. The grids were washed with distilled water and then conventionally labelled with uranyl acetate and lead citrate. Sections were viewed with a Zeiss Libra 120 transmission electron microscope (TEM; Zeiss).
