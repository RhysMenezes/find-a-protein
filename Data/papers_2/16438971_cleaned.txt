!~ABS~! Calcium-dependent protein kinases (CDPKs) are sensor-transducer proteins capable of decoding calcium signals in diverse phosphorylation-dependent calcium signaling networks in plants and some protists. Using a novel yeast two-hybrid (YTH) approach with constitutively active and/or catalytically inactive forms of AtCPK11 as bait, we identified AtDi19 as an AtCPK11-interacting protein. AtDi19 is a member of a small family of stress-induced genes. The interaction was confirmed using pull-down assays with in vitro translated AtCPK11 and GST–AtDi19 and localization studies in Arabidopsis protoplasts cotransfected with AtCPK11:GFP and AtDi19:DsRed2 protein fusions. We further showed that the interaction of AtDi19 is specific to both AtCPK4 and AtCPK11, whereas other closely related CPKs from Arabidopsis interacted weakly (e.g., AtCPK12) or did not interact (e.g., AtCPK26, AtCPK5 and AtCPK1) with AtDi19. Deletion analyses showed that a region containing two predicted nuclear localization signals (NLS) and a nuclear export signal (NES) of AtDi19 is essential for interaction with AtCPK11. We further demonstrated that AtDi19 is phosphorylated by AtCPK11 in a Ca 2+ -dependent manner at Thr105 and Ser107 within the AtDi19 bipartite NLS using in vitro kinase assays. Our data suggest that disruption of the autoinhibitor domain leading to the formation of a constitutively active CDPK may stabilize kinase–substrate interactions without affecting specificity.
!~RES~! The AtCPK11 gene encodes a predicted protein of 495 amino acid containing the well-conserved protein kinase domain (amino acids 26–284) and a C-terminal domain (amino acids 323–495) with four EF-hands involved in calcium binding joined together by an auto-inhibitor or pseudosubstrate domain (amino acids 285–322) ( [fig1] A). The first 25 amino acids form the N-terminal domain, which is highly variable in both length and sequence in most CDPKs, typically contains subcellular targeting information [bib13] . However, AtCPK11 is one of only five Arabidopsis CDPKs without a predicted N-terminal myristoylation site (no Gly at position 2) [bib4] . The yeast-two hybrid system has been previously used to identify substrates for CDPKs [bib17 bib21] . In both cases, the efficiency of recovering kinase substrates was improved through the use of truncated versions of the CDPK. For AtCPK11, we tested the hypothesis that the use of catalytically impaired and/or constitutively active variants of AtCPK11 baits would improve the efficiency of recovery of putative prey proteins (see Section [sec1] ). None of the three baits were able to auto-induce the His3 reporter gene ( [fig1] B). We identified five clones corresponding to the AtDi19 gene ( D ehydration- i nduced 19, At1g56280) [bib9] . Moreover, AtDi19 was detected in the screens performed using the three different forms of AtCPK11 baits. Specific interaction between baits and AtDi19 in yeast was confirmed, as yeast co-transformed with the three baits and rescued pGADT7–AtDi19 plasmid were able to grow in selective medium, whereas cells co-transformed with empty vector (pBUTE) and pGADT7–AtDi19 plasmid did not show any indication of interaction ( [fig1] C). AtDi19 interacted strongly with all three mutated versions of AtCPK11, but only very weakly with the wild type kinase ( [fig1] C). To validate the interaction of AtCPK11 with AtDi19 observed in the yeast two-hybrid system, we tested the ability of these two proteins to interact using an in vitro “pull-down” assay. 6xHis–AtCPK11 was expressed in the presence of [ 35 S]-Met in a coupled in vitro transcription/translation wheat germ extract system. A full-length protein (∼62 kDa) was obtained along with additional lower molecular weight products, which are likely truncation products ( [fig2] ). For the interaction assay, [ 35 S]-Met-labeled AtCPK11 was incubated with resin-bound GST–AtDi19 or GST. After washing, the presence of AtCPK11 was clearly detected in the GST–AtDi19 sample showing interaction, whereas binding of AtCPK11 to GST was almost undetectable ( [fig2] ). AtCPK11 is one of only a few Arabidopsis CDPKs that are not predicted to undergo N-terminal acylation [bib4] . Like AtCPK4, which is 95% identical to AtCPK11 and has been shown to have a nuclear and cytosolic localization in transgenic Arabidopsis plants [bib6] , AtCPK11 lacks an N-terminal acylation consensus motif and contains two potential NLSs, P 57 KRK 60 and P 268 KKR 271 . Thus, AtCPK11 is expected to have a similar subcellular distribution. In agreement with this prediction, we found that AtCPK11–GFP localized throughout the cytoplasm and nucleus in Arabidopsis protoplasts ( [fig3] A). The observation that AtCPK11 is localized in both the cytosol and the nucleus suggests that these proteins may shuttle between the cytosol and nucleus. We next studied the subcellular localization of AtDi19 by fusing its complete predicted open reading frame to the N-terminus of DsRed2 protein. The AtDi19–DsRed2 fusion protein displayed a ‘speckled’ pattern of nuclear localization ( [fig3] B). This localization pattern is consistent with the NLS and NES sequences present in AtDi19 and it would appear that its default localization is nuclear. The presence of both NLS and NES sequences in a protein suggests that its nuclear concentration could be tightly regulated in response to different types of signals through the modulation of both nuclear import and export [bib22] . Finally, the common localization pattern of both protein fusions ( [fig3] C) is also consistent with interactions occurring between AtCPK11 and AtDi19 in the nucleus, where both AtCPK11 and AtDi19 are present. AtCPK11 belongs to a family of 34 CDPKs in Arabidopsis [bib4 bib11] . We tested whether other closely related CDPKs could interact with AtDi19 in a YTH system. Constitutively, active forms of five other CDPKs located on the same branch of the CDPK phylogenetic tree group as AtCPK11 (e.g., AtCPK4, AtCPK12, AtCPK26, AtCPK5, and AtCPK1, listed in order of similarity to AtCPK11) [bib4] were cloned into the pBUTE vector to make GAL4BD fusions and tested for their interaction with AtDi19-GAL4AD ( [fig4] ). Interestingly, only AtCPK4 and AtCPK12, which are most similar to AtCPK11, interacted with AtDi19. However, when interaction was tested at a higher stringency (5 mM 3-AT), only AtCPK11 and AtCPK4 interacted with AtDi19, indicating that interaction with these proteins is more specific. None of the kinases showed autoinduction of the His3 gene as bait and, as expected, none of the wild type kinases interacted with AtDi19 (data not shown) under the conditions tested. The interaction of AtCPK4-F305A with AtDi19 is not surprising, as AtCPK11 and AtCPK4 are two of the most closely related CDPKs in Arabidopsis. However, both proteins may undergo different regulation in the plant. The weak interaction detected between AtCPK12-F302A and AtDi19 is consistent with the above observations as this kinase is the next most closely related member of the CDPK superfamily. Our study also included the constitutively active forms of AtCPK1, demonstrated previously to be partially Ca +2 independent [bib31] , and AtCPK26, another soluble CDPK highly similar to AtCPK11 with the same subcellular localization pattern as AtCPK4 and AtCPK11 (Dr. Naomi Etheridge, unpublished data). Taken together, our results indicate that constitutively active CDPKs can be used to identify interaction partners that are specific for a particular CDPK (or its closely-related homologs). During yeast two-hybrid screening, we observed that one of the five AtDi19 prey clones encoded only the first 128 amino acids of the AtDi19 protein and lacked the C-terminal domain of 78 amino acids. This observation suggested that the interaction with AtCPK11 could occur through the N-terminal segment of the protein. To identify the AtDi19 region responsible for the interaction with AtCPK11, the full-length AtDi19 (206 aa) and five deletion constructs were cloned into pGADT7, and introduced into yeast cells together with the pBUTE-AtCPK11-F306A plasmid ( [fig5] A). AtDi19 deletion constructs in the presence of empty bait vector were not able to grow on His medium ( [fig5] B). Removal of the C-terminal domain of AtDi19 (AtDi19-1–128), which did not prevent interaction with AtCPK11, suggests that this C-terminal domain (AtDi19-129–206) is not necessary for interaction ( [fig5] B). This was further confirmed by the lack of interaction between AtCPK11 and the AtDi19-129–206 construct. In addition, N-terminal 32 residues of AtDi19 do not appear to participate in the interaction with AtCPK11 either, because the interaction of AtCPK11 with a construct lacking this and the C-terminal regions (AtDi19-33–128) was as strong as with the full-length AtDi19. The central region of AtDi19 (AtDi19-33–128) contains a domain with two C2H2-like zinc fingers (amino acids 33–92). In addition, it contains a monopartite NLS (R 93 KRK 96 ) and a bipartite NLS (R 98 KSGTNSTLSLLRKELR 114 ) predicted by the PSORT software [bib20] ( http://psort.nibb.ac.jp ). Moreover, a leucine-rich sequence ( L 113 REGD L QR L 121 ) was predicted to be a putative NES by the NetNES software [bib16] ( http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/NetNES/ ). We tested the interaction of the Zn finger domains and the NLS/NES sequences with AtCPK11 and determined that the NLS/NES region was necessary and sufficient for interaction with the kinase, although this interaction was slightly weaker than if both Zn finger domains and the NLS/NES region were present ( [fig5] B). Taken together, these deletion analyses indicate that AtCPK11 may interact with AtDi19 through the NLS–NES region, although we cannot preclude a role for the zinc finger-like domains in the interaction with AtCPK11. To determine if AtDi19 is a substrate of AtCPK11, we tested its ability to be phosphorylated by AtCPK11 using an in vitro kinase assay. Recombinant His-tagged-AtCPK11 and GST–AtDi19 were expressed in E. coli and purified by affinity chromatography ( [fig6] A). Recombinant AtCPK11 phosphorylated GST–AtDi19 after a short incubation period with [γ 32 P]-ATP ( [fig6] B), corroborating the interaction observed in previous assays. Autophosphorylation of 6xHis–AtCPK11 was more evident when it was incubated with the GST–AtDi19 fusion protein than when 6xHis–AtCPK11 was incubated alone or with GST ( [fig6] B). This suggests that autophosphorylation of AtCPK11 is enhanced upon binding to the substrate. Autophosphorylation and substrate phosphorylation were Ca +2 -dependent ( [fig6] B). As expected, no phosphorylation of GST–AtDi19 was observed when it was incubated with AtCPK11 containing the D150A mutation, which conferred a catalytically inactive kinase. This result demonstrated that GST–AtDi19 is phosphorylated by AtCPK11. Taken together, these results indicate that AtDi19 can interact with and be phosphorylated by AtCPK11 in a Ca +2 -dependent manner. Recently, mass spectrometry has been widely used to identify proteins and post-translational modification of proteins [bib2] . To identify potential AtDi19 residues phosphorylated by AtCPK11 we performed MALDI-TOF MS and Ion-Trap LC/MS/MS. MALDI-TOF MS analysis identified a phosphorylated peptide within AtDi19 bipartite NLS sequence. The m / z and amino acid sequence of the peptide was 1599.7 and S 97 RKSGTNSTLSLLR 110 , respectively (data not shown). The phosphorylated residues of the peptide could not be unambiguously determined. In addition, LC/MS/MS analysis identified another phosphorylated peptide. The m / z and amino acid sequence of the peptide was 1356.6 and S 100 GTNSTLSLLRK 111 , respectively. The MS/MS data showed that Ser 100 and Thr 102 were not phosphorylated. Nevertheless, the phosphorylation of Ser 104 , Thr 105 and Ser 107 could not be unambiguously determined, which indicated that AtCPK11 may phosphorylate within the AtDi19 bipartite NLS at multiple residues. This hypothesis was further confirmed by in vitro kinase assays using the peptide S 100 GTNSTLSLLR 110 fused to GST as a substrate. We demonstrated that this wild type peptide was phosphorylated by AtCPK11 in vitro ( K m = 25 μM) ( [fig7] A). This K m value is within the expected range for a protein to be considered a good substrate for a CDPK [bib10] . As expected, no phosphorylation of GST–AtDi19 was observed when it was incubated with AtCPK11 containing the D150A mutation (data not shown). In addition, using the same peptide containing individual mutations of Ser 104 , Thr 105 and Ser 107 to Ala we showed that one or both Thr 105 and Ser 107 are the preferred sites phosphorylated by AtCPK11 as mutations of these residues reduced phosphorylation of the peptide to only 30% and 23% relative to the wild type, respectively ( [fig7] A and B). The S 107 LLR 110 motif resembles a typical phosphorylation site for CDPKs (S-X-X-Basic) [bib10] , but the Thr 105 site appears to be novel. There are two major conclusions that can be drawn from this study. First, our data suggest that the AtCPK11-F306A mutation makes the interaction of the kinase with AtDi19 (and possibly with other substrates) more stable ( [fig1] ). Second, to validate our approach, we have demonstrated that constitutively active AtCPK11 interacts with AtDi19 through the same domain that is phosphorylated by the wild type kinase. These results, together with the analysis of the interaction of similar CDPKs with AtDi19 suggest that disruption of the autoinhibitor does not affect the specificity of the kinase for its substrate. Thus, it is possible that the same approach could be used to improve the efficiency of identifying candidate substrates for other CDPKs.
!~MM~! Three mutations were generated in the AtCPK11 protein. Substitution of Asp (D) 150 by Ala (A) (AtCPK11-D150A) and of D171 to A (AtCPK11-D171A) resulted in catalytic impairment of the kinase [bib8] . The change of Phe (F) 306 to A (AtCPK11-F306A) disrupted the autoinhibitor resulting in a constitutively active (partially Ca 2+ -dependent) kinase [bib31] . Three different combinations of AtCPK11 mutants were used as baits: AtCPK11-D150A/F306A, AtCPK11-D171A/F306A, and AtCPK11-F306A. Mutations were created using the Quickchange™ site-directed mutagenesis kit according to manufacturer’s instructions (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The primers used (only the forward primer is shown) were: AtCPK11-D150A, 5′-GGTGTTATGCATAGAGCTCTCAAACCTGAG-3′; AtCPK11-D171A, 5′-GCTTAAGGCTACCGCTTTTGGTTTGTCTG-3′; AtCPK11-F306A, 5′-TCTCGTCTAAAGCAGGCTTCTCAAATGAAT-3′. PCR amplification products of these genes were subcloned into the pBUTE Y2H bait vector to make a GAL4BD fusion protein by recombinational cloning using the following primers: AtCPK11 forward, 5′-CAAAGACAGTTGACTGTATCGCCGGAATTCgagacgaagccaaaccctagacgtccttca-3′; AtCPK11 reverse, 5′–TCAGTATCTACGATTCATAGATCTCTGCAGtcagtcatcagatttttcaccatcaactcc-3′. Uppercase nucleotides are vector target sequence; lowercase amplify bait inserts. Bait plasmids were sequenced to confirm that the inserts were in-frame with the GAL4 DNA-binding domain and transformed into PJ69-4A. High throughput yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) screens were performed in the University of Wisconsin Molecular Interaction Facility (Madison, WI) according to their methods ( http://www.biotech.wisc.edu/mif/ ). The mutants used as baits in the Y2H screening were cloned into the pBUTE plasmid, a modification of the pBDU-C1 vector [bib15] , constructed by swapping the kanamycin-resistance marker gene for an ampicillin-resistance gene and transformed into the PJ69-4A, MATa yeast strain. This strain is unable to grow on medium without Leu, Ura, His, and Ade. The pBUTE plasmid contains the URA3 gene that allows yeast cells to grow in medium without Ura. Two Arabidopsis cDNA libraries were screened with each bait. One library was prepared from three-day-old etiolated seedlings and the other from three-week-old plants grown on MS agar plates and then subjected to 16 different treatments. Both prey libraries were constructed in pGADT7-Rec using a MATCHMAKER GAL4 Two-Hybrid System 3 kit (Clontech, Mountain View, CA, USA) and introducing the library into yeast strain PJ69-4α. Approximately 18 million clones from each library were screened via mating and selection on Ura/Leu/His drop-out media containing 1 mM 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole (3-AT). Positives were detected by assaying growth (620 nm) and confirmed by assaying for a second yeast reporter via β-galactosidase assays. To validate observed interactions, prey plasmids were isolated, analyzed by restriction digest and representative plasmids were transformed into PJ69-4α. Yeast with preys were mated one-on-one in parallel against the yeast expressing the target baits and the empty bait vector (baits in yeast mating type A). A second Y2H analysis was performed at the University of Nevada under the same conditions. In order to make valid comparisons among AtCPK11 wild type and mutants, cDNA fragments containing the open reading frame (ORF) of AtCPK11 (wild type and the three mutants) were amplified by PCR and cloned into the pBUTE vector. To generate AtDi19 truncated versions for yeast two-hybrid analysis, cDNA fragments containing different domains of AtDi19 were amplified by PCR and the fragments were inserted into the pGADT7 vector. The constructs were verified by restriction digestion and sequencing. The coding region of AtCPK11 (At1g35670) was amplified by PCR and the fragment was inserted into the 35S-sGFP-TYG-NOS (pUC19) plasmid kindly provided by Dr. Jen Sheen (Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA, USA). The resulting construct consisted of AtCPK11 fused to the N-terminus of the GFP protein. AtDi19 was fused to the N-terminus of the DsRed2 protein. The ORF was amplified by PCR and the fragment was inserted into the pDsRed2-1 plasmid (BD Biosciences Inc., Palo Alto, CA, USA). Then, the resulting AtDi19–DsRed2 construct was digested with Sal I and Not I and the DNA fragment (containing AtDi19 fused to the N-terminus of DsRed2) was inserted into the 35S-sGFP-TYG-NOS plasmid, substituting for the previously described AtCPK11-sGFP fusion protein. Transient expression of GFP and DsRed2 fusion constructs in Arabidopsis protoplasts was performed according to Sheen [bib30] . After 16 h, transformed cells were visualized with a Nikon Eclipse E400 epifluorescence microscope (Nikon Corp., Tokyo, Japan). GFP was visualized with a 450–490 nm excitation filter, a 495 dichroic mirror, and a 500–550 nm emission filter. DsRed2 was visualized with a 528–553 nm excitation filter, a 565 dichroic mirror, and a 600–660 nm emission filter. To generate a 6xHis–AtCPK11 fusion protein, the entire ORF of AtCPK11 was amplified by PCR and inserted into the pET30a vector (Novagen Inc., Madison, WI, USA). The respective coding region or sub-domains of AtDi19 was cloned into the pGEX-4T vector (Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ, USA). Plasmid constructs were transformed into Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) and protein expression was induced by 0.5 mM IPTG for 3 h (2 h for GST or GST fusion peptides) at 30 °C. Purification of recombinant proteins was monitored by 10% SDS–PAGE and in the case of 6xHis–AtCPK11, by Western blot hybridization using a monoclonal anti-6xHis antibody (Covance, Berkeley, CA, USA) used at a 1:1000 dilution and detected with the Western-Light Plus kit (Applied Biosystems, Bedford, MA, USA). 6xHis–AtCPK11 was stored at −20 °C in 50% glycerol, 5 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, and 0.5 μg/μl BSA. The 6xHis–AtCPK11 fusion construct was transcribed and translated in wheat germ extract using the TNT ® T7 Coupled Wheat Germ Extract System (Promega, Madison, WI, USA). The pET30a-AtCPK11 plasmid used to purify the His-AtCPK11 protein in E. coli was linearized and used as the DNA template. The labeling procedure was performed according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Then, the sample was centrifuged at 20 000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. The binding assay was performed by attaching equimolar amounts of GST–AtDi19 and GST (approximately 20 and 10 μg, respectively) to glutathione sepharose 4B beads and then, a 35 μl aliquot of resin was mixed with 45 μl of TNT ® T7 reaction. Samples were rotated for 1 h at 4 °C, pelleted and washed three times with 350 μl of buffer (50 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 100 mM KCl, 2.5 mM MgCl 2 , 250 μM EGTA, 350 μM CaCl 2 , and 2 mM DTT). Proteins were eluted from the resin by adding 35 μl of warm 2× SDS–PAGE sample buffer. Samples were heated at 95 °C for 5 min and proteins were separated by 10% SDS–PAGE. The gel was washed with water for 5 min and incubated in a solution containing 1.65% sodium pyrophosphate and 5% trichloroacetic acid for 15 min. Then, the gel was washed with water for 10 min, dried at 80 °C under vacuum and the 35 S labeled proteins were visualized by autoradiography. In vitro kinase assays were performed in a 20 μl reaction containing 20 mM Tris–HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mM MgCl 2 , 1 mM EGTA, and 1.1 mM CaCl 2 . In control reactions, CaCl 2 was omitted. Phosphorylation reactions were initiated by adding a mixture of 50 μM ATP and 5 μCi of [γ 32 P]-ATP and incubated for 20 min at 25 °C. Reactions were stopped by adding 20 μl of 2× SDS–PAGE sample buffer, heated at 80 °C for 5 min and proteins were separated by 10% SDS–PAGE. Then, the gel was treated as above and the phosphorylated proteins were visualized by autoradiography. Mass spectrometry (MS) analysis was performed and modified as previously described [bib3] . After the kinase reaction (6 h), reaction products were dried and the pellet was re-suspended in a trypsin solution containing 100 ng total (0.66 ng/ul) trypsin, (Promega), 14.8 mM ammonium bicarbonate, 2.7 mM dithiothreitol, 7.3 mM iodoacetamide, 0.08% formic acid, 13% acetonitrile, pH 8.0, and incubated for 16 h at 37 °C. The digested peptides were desalted three times, and eluted with conditioning solution (70% acetonitrile, 0.2% formic acid, 5 mg/ml α-Cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid), and spotted onto a matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization (MALDI) target using a ZipTip (cat. No. ZTC18M960; Millipore Inc., Billerica, MA, USA). MALDI-time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometer (MS) analysis of trypsin-digested peptides was performed on a 4700 Proteomics Analyzer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) at the Proteomics/MS Facility at the University of Nevada, Reno. For Ion-Trap MS/MS analysis, tryptic digested peptides separated by liquid chromatography (Michrom BioResources Inc., Auburn, CA, USA) and analyzed on a coupled nanospray LCQ DECA XP (Thermo Finnigan, San Jose, CA, USA). A neutral loss method [bib28] was applied to select neutral loss ions. Database searching was performed to identify the phosphorylated peptides. For MALDI-TOF MS data, m / z values were searched against the NCBI Ababidopsis database by use of the MS-FIT fingerprinting algorithm ( http://prospector.ucsf.edu/ucsfhtml4.0/msfit.htm ). For Ion-Trap MS/MS data, m / z values of the precursor, y and b ions were searched against the NCBI database by use of the TURBOSEQUEST algorithm (Thermo Finnigan) or MASCOT algorithm (Matrix Science, Boston, MA). In addition, peptides with neutral loss were queried and identified by manual inspection. The MS/MS or MS/MS/MS spectrum of the phosphorylated peptide was inspected manually either compared to the theoretical mass or de novo sequencing by use of DeNovoX (Thermo Finnigan) to confirm the phosphorylation.
