!~ABS~! Pharmacological evidence suggests that anion channel-mediated plasma membrane anion effluxes are crucial in early defense signaling to induce immune responses and hypersensitive cell death in plants. However, their molecular bases and regulation remain largely unknown. We overexpressed Arabidopsis SLAC1, an S-type anion channel involved in stomatal closure, in cultured tobacco BY-2 cells and analyzed the effect on cryptogein-induced defense responses including fluxes of Cl− and other ions, production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), gene expression and hypersensitive responses. The SLAC1-GFP fusion protein was localized at the plasma membrane in BY-2 cells. Overexpression of SLAC1 enhanced cryptogein-induced Cl− efflux and extracellular alkalinization as well as rapid/transient and slow/prolonged phases of NADPH oxidase-mediated ROS production, which was suppressed by an anion channel inhibitor, DIDS. The overexpressor also showed enhanced sensitivity to cryptogein to induce downstream immune responses, including the induction of defense marker genes and the hypersensitive cell death. These results suggest that SLAC1 expressed in BY-2 cells mediates cryptogein-induced plasma membrane Cl− efflux to positively modulate the elicitor-triggered activation of other ion fluxes, ROS as well as a wide range of defense signaling pathways. These findings shed light on the possible involvement of the SLAC/SLAH family anion channels in cryptogein signaling to trigger the plasma membrane ion channel cascade in the plant defense signal transduction network.
!~RES~! Pharmacological evidence suggests the importance of anion channel-mediated anion efflux in cryptogein-induced initial responses in cultured tobacco cells [pone.0070623-Gauthier1]. We therefore checked the effect of an anion channel inhibitor, DIDS, on cryptogein-induced hypersensitive responses in BY-2 cells. Increasing evidence suggests the involvement of mitochondrial dysfunction in the induction of hypersensitive cell death in plants as well as in animals [pone.0070623-Lam1]. MTT reductase activity was monitored as a marker for mitochondrial function [pone.0070623-Kurusu2]. As shown in [pone-0070623-g001], cryptogein induced a rapid reduction in MTT reductase activity in BY-2 cells in a time-dependent manner, which was significantly inhibited by DIDS ([pone-0070623-g001]). A Ser/Thr protein kinase inhibitor, K-252a also suppressed the reduction in MTT reductase activity in a dose-dependent manner ([pone.0070623.s001]). (A) Cryptogein (1 µM)-induced reductions in MTT reductase activity. MTT reductase activity was used as a putative marker for mitochondrial dysfunction. Black circle: cryptogein treatment, white circle: water treatment as a control. *** p<0.001, significantly different from the control. (B) Inhibitory effect of DIDS on cryptogein-induced reductions in MTT reductase activity. BY-2 cells 3 h after the addition of the cryptogein elicitor (1 µM). DIDS or DMSO was added to BY-2 cells 15 min prior to the elicitor treatment. Data are the mean ± SE of three independent experiments. * p<0.05, ** p<0.005, significantly different from the control. DMSO was used as a control. (C) Effect of DIDS on cryptogein-induced HIN1 expression. Total RNA was isolated from BY-2 cells harvested 2 h after the addition of cryptogein. DIDS (white bars) or DMSO (black bars) was added to BY-2 cells 15 min prior to the elicitor treatment. The amount of each mRNA was calculated from the threshold point located in the log-linear range of RT-PCR. The relative level of each gene in control cells at time 0 was standardized as 1. Data are the mean ± SE of three independent experiments. ** p<0.005, *** p<0.001, significantly different from the control. The expression of a harpin-induced gene HIN1 has been suggested to correlate with hypersensitive responses [pone.0070623-Gopalan1]. The expression of HIN1 was induced 5 h after the application of cryptogein ([pone-0070623-g001]), which was strongly reduced by DIDS ([pone-0070623-g001]). These results suggest that anion channels are involved in the regulation of cryptogein-induced hypersensitive responses in BY-2 cells. Arabidopsis SLAC1 is an S-type anion channel located at the plasma membrane in guard cells [pone.0070623-Negi1], [pone.0070623-Vahisalu1]. To study intracellular localization of the SLAC1 protein expressed in BY-2 cells, we introduced the GFP construct fused to the C-terminus of SLAC1 into BY-2 protoplasts and examined its intracellular localization by confocal laser scanning microscopy. When GFP alone was expressed, it localized to the nucleus and the cytoplasm ([pone-0070623-g002]; d-f). In contrast, the SLAC1-GFP fusion protein was specifically targeted to the plasma membrane; fluorescent images of SLAC1-GFP were clearly different from those of FM4-64, a marker for internal membranes ([pone-0070623-g002]; a-c), indicating that SLAC1 functions at the plasma membrane in BY-2 cells as in Arabidopsis guard cells. Confocal fluorescence images (a-f) of BY-2 protoplast expressing SLAC1-GFP (a–c) or GFP (d–f) stained with the fluorescent styryl membrane probe FM4-64. Fluorescence of GFP (a and d) and FM4-64 (b and e). Scale bar: 10 µm. FM4-64 was kept as a 17 mM stock solution in sterile water, and used at a final concentration of 4.25 µM. Tobacco BY-2 protoplasts were treated with FM4-64 for 10 min and washed twice with the wash buffer at room temperature to label the PM. To test possible involvement of SLAC1 in the cryptogein-induced plasma membrane anion efflux, we generated transgenic tobacco BY-2 cell lines expressing Arabidopsis SLAC1 by means of Agrobacterium-mediated transformation [pone.0070623-An1]. Several transformant lines were obtained and the expression of SLAC1 mRNA in BY-2 cells was confirmed by RT-PCR analyses ([pone.0070623.s002]). Finally, four transformant lines (line No. 1–4) were selected for further investigation. To confirm if SLAC1 plays a role in anion transport in BY-2 cells, we tested whether the expression levels of SLAC1 mRNA affected anion transport activity. Extracellular Cl− concentration ([Cl−]ext) was simultaneously monitored with ion-selective electrodes in the growth medium. Extracellular [Cl−] showed a prolonged increase after cryptogein application ([pone-0070623-g003]), which is consistent with our previous report [pone.0070623-Kadota1]. As shown in [pone-0070623-g003], cryptogein-induced Cl− efflux was significantly higher in the SLAC1-overexpressing cells than in non-transgenic control cells. DIDS clearly suppressed cryptogein-induced Cl− efflux ([pone-0070623-g003]), suggesting that an S-type anion channel, SLAC1, is involved in the cryptogein-induced plasma membrane Cl− efflux in BY-2 cells. (A) Time course of cryptogein-induced [Cl–]ext changes in BY-2 cells. BY-2 cells were treated with cryptogein (0.25 µM). (B) Effect of DIDS on cryptogein-induced [Cl–]ext changes. DIDS (100 µM) was added to BY-2 cells 15 min prior to the elicitor (0.25 µM) treatment. DMSO was used as a control. (C) Time course of cryptogein-induced [pH]ext changes. BY-2 cells were treated with cryptogein (1 µM). ** p<0.005, *** p<0.001, significantly different from the control line. (D) Effect of DIDS on cryptogein-induced [pH]ext changes. DIDS (50 µM) was added to BY-2 cells 15 min prior to the elicitor treatment. DMSO was used as a control. Data are the mean ± SE of three independent experiments. * p<0.05, significantly different from the control line. Pharmacological evidence suggests the importance of Cl- efflux in cryptogein-induced initial signaling events in BY-2 cells [pone.0070623-Kadota1], [pone.0070623-Wendehenne1]. Since SLAC1 has been suggested to be involved in the regulation of Cl- efflux ([pone-0070623-g003]), we investigated possible involvement of SLAC1 in cryptogein-induced pH change as a marker for the initial plasma membrane signaling events [pone.0070623-Kadota1]. Cryptogein induced biphasic slow and prolonged extracellular alkalinization ([pone-0070623-g003]), which is consistent with our previous report [pone.0070623-Kadota1]. This elicitor–induced extracellular alkalinization was much more evident in SLAC1 overexpressors than in non-transgenic control cells, which were severely inhibited by DIDS ([pone-0070623-g003]). These results suggest that SLAC1-mediated Cl- efflux modulates other ion fluxes known as initial defense signaling events in BY-2 cells. Production of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) was monitored by an assay using luminol chemiluminescence [pone.0070623-Kurusu4]. As shown in [pone-0070623-g004], cryptogein triggered rapid ROS production within 5 min, which is consistent with our previous report [pone.0070623-Kadota1]. The increment of ROS production was dramatically enhanced in the SLAC1 overexpressors than the control at a low concentration of cryptogein ([pone-0070623-g004]). An NADPH oxidase inhibitor, DPI (10 µM), almost completely abolished cryptogein-induced ROS production both in SLAC1-overexpressors and the control ([pone-0070623-g004]), suggesting that cryptogein-triggered ROS production is predominantly mediated by NADPH oxidases [pone.0070623-Kadota1]. DIDS clearly suppressed elicitor-induced ROS production ([pone-0070623-g004]), suggesting that overexpression of SLAC1 leads to enhanced activation of the NADPH oxidases. Taken together, SLAC1-mediated anion efflux is suggested to affect the regulation of NADPH-oxidase activity. (A) Cryptogein (0.25 µM)-induced rapid transient ROS production within 15 min in BY-2 cells. Data is representative of three experiments (B) The effects of inhibitors on cryptogein-induced ROS production within 15 min. To quantify the effects of inhibitors on ROS production, the peak intensity of luminol chemiluminescence was compared with the control. DIDS or an NADPH oxidase inhibitor, DPI, was added to BY-2 cells 15 min prior to the elicitor treatment. DMSO was used as a control. Data are the mean ± SE of three independent experiments. ** p<0.005, significantly different from the control line. (C) Effect of SLAC1-overexpression on cryptogein-induced prolonged ROS production. BY-2 cells were treated with cryptogein (0.25 µM). Data are the mean ± SE of three independent experiments. * p<0.05, ** p<0.005, *** p<0.001, significantly different from the control line. (D) Quantitative expression levels of NtRbohD mRNAs in SLAC1-overexpressing cells by real-time quantitative PCR. Total RNA was isolated from BY-2 cells harvested 5 h after the addition of cryptogein at various concentrations. The amount of each mRNA was calculated from the threshold point located in the log-linear range of the RT-PCR. The relative level of each gene in the control cells at time 0. Data are the mean ± SE of four independent experiments. * p<0.005, ** p<0.005, significantly different from the control line. Cryptogein induces biphasic (rapid/transient and slow/prolonged) ROS production in tobacco BY-2 cells [pone.0070623-Kadota2]. Expression of a tobacco NOX homolog NtRbohD, encoding NADPH oxidase, is induced in response to cryptogein/elicitors or avirulent pathogens and is suggested to be essential for the slow and prolonged ROS production [pone.0070623-Kadota2]–[pone.0070623-Kadota3]. As shown in [pone-0070623-g004], the time course of cryptogein-induced prolonged ROS production and expression of NtRbohD correlated well, and both of them were significantly enhanced in the SLAC1-overexpressors in comparison with the control at a low concentration of cryptogein. DIDS severely inhibited cryptogein-induced prolonged ROS production (data not shown) as the rapid/transient ROS production ([pone-0070623-g004]). Taken together, these results suggest that SLAC1-mediated anion flux is involved in the regulation of cryptogein-induced expression of respiratory burst oxidase homologs (Rbohs) and NADPH oxidase-mediated ROS production. Rbohs have been suggested to be involved in ROS production and the regulation of hypersensitive cell death in Arabidopsis and rice [pone.0070623-Torres1]–[pone.0070623-Wong1]. To further characterize the role of SLAC1 in the downstream signaling pathway elicited by cryptogein, we analyzed the induction of defense-related genes and hypersensitive cell death in the SLAC1-overexpressors. Hypersensitive-related (hsr) gene, Hsr203J, that encodes a serine hydrolase with esterase activity, is postulated to regulate either the establishment or limitation of cell death [pone.0070623-Pontier1]. The expression of HIN1 is correlated with hypersensitive responses [pone.0070623-Gopalan1]. The expression of HIN1 and Hsr203J were induced 5 h after the application of cryptogein in non-transgenic cells ([pone-0070623-g005]). At lower concentration range of the elicitor, the expression of both HIN1 and Hsr203J were significantly higher in the SLAC1-overexpressors than in the control. At higher concentrations of cryptogein (4 µM), the expression of the genes was almost comparable between the overexpressors and the control ([pone-0070623-g005]). (A and B) Cryptogein-induced the expression of HIN1 in a dose-dependent manner (A) and Hsr203j (B) in SLAC1-overexpressing cells. The amount of each mRNA was calculated from the threshold point located in the log-linear range of the RT-PCR. The relative level of each gene in the control cells at time 0. Total RNA was isolated from BY-2 cells harvested 5 h after the addition of cryptogein at various concentrations. Data are the mean ± SE of three independent experiments. * p<0.05, ** p<0.005, significantly different from the control line. Hypersensitive cell death as a form of programmed cell death is a crucial event to prevent the spread of biotrophic pathogens [pone.0070623-Higaki2]. Anion efflux has been suggested to be involved in the regulation of cryptogein-induced hypersensitive cell death in cultured tobacco cells [pone.0070623-Gauthier1]. Evans blue staining was applied to quantify the levels of cell death [pone.0070623-Kadota2]. As shown in [pone-0070623-g006], hypersensitive cell death was much more evident in the SLAC1-overexpressors than that of the control cells, and the levels of cell death corresponded with the expression levels of SLAC1. Overall, these results indicate that the overexpression of SLAC1 led to enhance the sensitivity to cryptogein to induce hypersensitive cell death. Cryptogein-induced cell death in a dose-dependent manner in SLAC1-overexpressing cells. BY-2 cells 24 h after the addition of the cryptogein elicitor at various concentrations. Evans blue staining was applied to quantify the level of cryptogein-induced cell death. Data are the mean ± SE of five independent experiments. **** p<0.001, significantly different from the control line.
!~MM~! The tobacco BY-2 (Nicotiana tabacum L. cv. Bright Yellow-2) cell suspension was grown in modified Linsmaier and Skoog (LS) medium as reported [pone.0070623-Nagata1], and agitated on a rotary shaker at 100 rpm at 25°C in the dark and used 1 week after subculture. To overexpress SLAC1 in both BY-2 cells, SLAC1 cDNA [pone.0070623-Negi1] was cloned into a Ti-based vector pBI121 downstream of a CaMV 35S promoter. Transformation of BY-2 cells was carried out as described in [pone.0070623-An1] with minor modifications as follows: 4 ml of 3-day-old exponentially growing culture was transferred to a 90 mm Petri dish and incubated at 28°C with 100 µl of fresh overnight-culture of Agrobacterium tumefaciens pGV2260 containing the binary vector pBI121. After 48-h co-cultivation, tobacco cells were washed and plated onto LS agar medium containing kanamycin (100 µg ml−1) and claforan (100 µg ml−1) (Sanofi Aventis Co., Tokyo, Japan). Every 3 to 4 weeks, transformants were selected and transferred onto fresh medium for continued selection. DIDS and FM4-64 were obtained from Life technologies (Carlsbad, CA, USA). DPI (diphenylene iodonium), K-252a, and luminol were purchased from Wako Pure Chemical (Osaka, Japan). Pichia pastoris (strain GS115) carrying the plasmid pLEP3 was used for cryptogein production [pone.0070623-Kadota1]. Cryptogein was produced according to O′Donohue et al. [pone.0070623-ODonohue1] and was dissolved in distilled water. Cryptogein concentration was determined using UV spectroscopy employing extinction coefficients of 8306 M−1cm−1 at 277 nm [pone.0070623-ODonohue2]. To monitor pH of the culture medium, aliquots of cells (30 g fresh weight) that had been subcultured for 3 d were transferred to 30 ml of fresh culture medium lacking KH2PO4. For extracellular Cl− concentration, aliquots of cells (30 g fresh weight) that had been subcultured for 7 d were transferred to 30 ml of fresh culture medium replacing CaCl2 with CaSO4. After a 3 h equilibration period on a gyratory shaker (160 rpm, 25°C) in open 100-ml vials, the pH of the culture medium was measured by the compact pH meter (Model AS-212, Horiba, Kyoto, Japan) according to the manufacturer's protocol. [Cl−] of the culture medium was measured with a pH/Ion meter (Model F-53, Horiba) with a combination electrode sensitive to Cl− (Model 8002, Horiba). BY-2 cells (3 day after subculture) were used for the ROS production assay. To monitor initial H2O2, cells were washed and resuspended in 5 mM MES buffer (pH 8.0) containing 175 mM mannitol, 0.5 mM CaCl2, and 0.5 mM K2SO4. After a 3 h equilibration period on a gyratory shaker (160 rpm, 25°C), 0.462 mM luminol and 5 mM Tris buffer (pH 8.0) was added. Fifteen minutes after luminol application, H2O2-dependent chemiluminescence was monitored with a luminometer (Lumicounter 2500, Microtech Nition, Chiba, Japan), in which the culture tube rotates 17 revolutions every 3 s clockwise and counterclockwise in turn, and agitates the cells [pone.0070623-Kadota1]. To detect prolonged H2O2 production, an aliquot (25 µl) of medium was mixed in a 96-well microtiter plate with 150 µl 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) and 25 µl 0.462 mM luminol in 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. Potassium ferricyanide (25 µl, 11.76 mM) was added, and H2O2-dependent chemiluminescence was recorded for 15 s using a luminometer (MicroLumat Plus LB96V, Berthold Technologies, Bad Wildbad, Germany). To quantify the effects of inhibitors on ROS production, the peak intensity of luminol chemiluminescence was compared and relative luminescence levels in the control were standardized as 100%. An aliquot of the cell suspension (50 mg fresh weight in 0.5 ml) was incubated with 0.05% Evans blue (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA) for 10 min and washed to remove unabsorbed dye. The selective staining of dead cells with Evans blue depends on extrusion of the dye from living cells via an intact plasma membrane [pone.0070623-Turner1]. Cell death was quantified by counting stained cells (250–300 cells per each treatment) using a microscope. An aliquot of the cell suspension (50 mg fresh weight in 0.5 ml) was incubated with 0.2 ml of 12 mM MTT (3-(4, 5-dimethyl-2-thiazolyl)-2, 5-diphenyl-2H tetrazolium bromide) solution (DOJINDO, Tokyo, Japan) for 0.5 h at 28°C. The supernatant was removed by centrifugation and 1 ml of acidic isopropanol (40 mM HCl) was added to stained cells, followed by incubation at 60°C for 15 min to elute the dye from the cells. A595 was measured to measure the reductase activity. Total RNA was isolated using Sepasol (Nacalai tesque, Kyoto, Japan) according to the manufacturer's protocol and quantified with a spectrophotometer. First-strand cDNA was synthesized from 3 µg total RNA with an oligo-dT primer (Life technologies) and reverse transcriptase (Promega, Fitchburg, WI, USA). PCR amplification was performed with an initial denaturation at 95°C for 3 min followed by the indicated number of cycles of incubations at 94°C for 30 s, 55°C for 90 s, and 72°C for 1 min, and a final extension at 72°C for 10 min using Arabidopsis SLAC1-specific primers (SLAC1-F 5′-GCCATTAGCGTACCTCCCAT-3′, SLAC1-R 5′- GCAGATATTTTCTTCGCCAG-3′). EF-1α (EF1α-F 5′-ATTCAAGTATGCCTGGGTGCTTGAC-3′, EF1α-R 5′-TTCGTTGTCGAGGACCATGC-3′) was used as a quantitative control. Aliquots of individual PCR products were resolved by agarose gel electrophoresis and visualized by ethidium bromide staining using a UV light. Real-time RT-PCR assays were performed as described by Kurusu et al. [pone.0070623-Kurusu3]. First-strand cDNA was synthesized from 2 µg of total RNA using an oligo-dT primer (Life technologies) and reverse transcriptase (Promega). Real-time PCR was performed using an ABI PRISM 7300 sequence detection system (Life technologies) with THUNDERBIRD SYBR qPCR Mix (TOYOBO, Osaka, Japan) and gene specific primers. The following PCR primers were used: Hsr203j-RealF, 5′-GTCTTATCGGAGCAAATCGGAGTTAG-3′; Hsr203j-RealR, 5′-CTCCCATCGGACATGTTATTGG-3′; HIN1-RealF, 5′-GAGGGTCACAAGAATACTAGCAGC-3′; HIN1-RealR, 5′-CGCATGTAAAGCTTCACTTCCATCTC-3′; NtRbohD-RealF, 5′-GCGGCAAGTCCAATGATGA-3′; NtRbohD-RealR, 5′-GAATCTTCGCGGACATCGA-3′; NtActin-RealF, 5′-GGGTTTGCTGGAGATGATGCT-3′; NtActin-RealR, 5′-GCTTCATCACCAACATATGCAT-3′PR1a-RealF, 5′-GTGGGTTAGCGAGAAGGCTA-3′; PR1a-RealR, 5′-ACTTTGGCACATCCGAGTCT-3′; AtTUB2-RealF, 5′-ATTCCCCCGTCTTCACTTCT-3′; AtRbohD-RealF, 5′- CCTCAACAACACCACCTCCT-3′; AtRbohD-RealR, 5′- GTAAGAGGCCGTTGGAATCA-3′; AtTUB2-RealF, 5′-ATTCCCCCGTCTTCACTTCT-3′;AtTUB2-RealR, 5′-CACATTCAGCATCTGCTCGT-3′;. Relative mRNA abundances were calculated using the standard curve method and normalized to corresponding NtActin and AtTUB2 gene levels. Standard samples of known template amounts were used to quantify PCR products. The green fluorescence protein (GFP) sequence derived from sGFP [pone.0070623-Chiu1] was fused to the C terminus of Arabidopsis SLAC1 cDNA and was cloned into a transient assay vector pUC19 downstream of a CaMV 35S promoter. The original sGFP plasmid was used as a control. Protoplasts were prepared from 3 d BY-2 cells using a standard method [pone.0070623-Nagata1], and plasmids were introduced into BY-2 protoplasts by polyethylene glycol-mediated transformation [pone.0070623-Miao1]. One day after transformation, GFP fluorescence images were observed using a LSM 5 EXCITER confocal fluorescence microscope with a C-Apochromat 40×/1.2W corr (water) (Carl Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany) as an objective lens. Images were processed using the Zeiss LSM Image Browser (Carl Zeiss Inc.) and the Adobe Photoshop Element 7.0 (Adobe Systems, San Jose, CA, USA). Statistical significance was determined using an unpaired Student's t test; P<0.05 indicated significance. The accession numbers for the genes described are as follows: SLAC1 (At1g12480), SLAH1 (At1g62280), SLAH2 (At4g27970), SLAH3 (At5g24030), SLAH4 (At1g62262), HIN1 (AB091429), Hsr203j (X77136), NtRbohD (AF506374), OST1 (At4g33950), CPK21 (At4g04720), CPK23 (At4g04740), PR1a (At2g14610), AtRbohD (At5g47910).
