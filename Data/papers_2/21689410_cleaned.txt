!~ABS~! The translocator protein 18 kDa (TSPO), previously known as the peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptor (PBR), is important for many cellular functions in mammals and bacteria, such as steroid biosynthesis, cellular respiration, cell proliferation, apoptosis, immunomodulation, transport of porphyrins and anions. Arabidopsis thaliana contains a single TSPO/PBR-related gene with a 40 amino acid N-terminal extension compared to its homologs in bacteria or mammals suggesting it might be chloroplast or mitochondrial localized. To test if the TSPO N-terminal extension targets it to organelles, we fused three potential translational start sites in the TSPO cDNA to the N-terminus of GFP (AtTSPO:eGFP). The location of the AtTSPO:eGFP fusion protein was found to depend on the translational start position and the conditions under which plants were grown. Full-length AtTSPO:eGFP fusion protein was found in the endoplasmic reticulum and in vesicles of unknown identity when plants were grown in standard conditions. However, full length AtTSPO:eGFP localized to chloroplasts when grown in the presence of 150 mM NaCl, conditions of salt stress. In contrast, when AtTSPO:eGFP was truncated to the second or third start codon at amino acid position 21 or 42, the fusion protein co-localized with a mitochondrial marker in standard conditions. Using promoter GUS fusions, qRT-PCR, fluorescent protein tagging, and chloroplast fractionation approaches, we demonstrate that AtTSPO levels are regulated at the transcriptional, post-transcriptional and post-translational levels in response to abiotic stress conditions. Salt-responsive genes are increased in a tspo-1 knock-down mutant compared to wild type under conditions of salt stress, while they are decreased when AtTSPO is overexpressed. Mutations in tetrapyrrole biosynthesis genes and the application of chlorophyll or carotenoid biosynthesis inhibitors also affect AtTSPO expression. Our data suggest that AtTSPO plays a role in the response of Arabidopsis to high salt stress. Salt stress leads to re-localization of the AtTSPO from the ER to chloroplasts through its N-terminal extension. In addition, our results show that AtTSPO is regulated at the transcriptional level in tetrapyrrole biosynthetic mutants. Thus, we propose that AtTSPO may play a role in transporting tetrapyrrole intermediates during salt stress and other conditions in which tetrapyrrole metabolism is compromised.
!~RES~! In Physcomitrella patens, the expression of PpTSPO-1 is induced by salt stress and abscisic acid (ABA) [[B22]]. AtTSPO is also induced by salt stress in Arabidopsis [[B24]], as well as in Arabidopsis cell cultures [[B23]]. We further defined the transcript abundance of AtTSPO in 5-day old seedlings treated with NaCl, mannitol, ABA and methyl viologen (MV), by extracting total RNA from these plants and performing quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). Compared to untreated plants, 150 mM NaCl, 250 mM mannitol, 1 μM ABA and 0.2 μM methyl viologen (MV) resulted in increased AtTSPO expression (Figure [F1]). The kinetics of AtTSPO induction by NaCl and ABA stress were similar, peaking 3 hours after treatment and slowly decreasing between 6-25 h (Figure [F1] and [F1] respectively). Addition of mannitol resulted in peak AtTSPO expression between 3-6 h and then slowly decreased in abundance (Figure [F1], [F1] and [F1]). However mannitol treatment showed a two-fold induction compared to treatment with NaCl for 3 h (Figure [F1] and [F1]), which suggests that AtTSPO is induced by osmotic stress rather than salt stress. AtTSPO is rapidly induced by MV treatment, showing induction at 1 h, peaking by 3 h and then falling to basal levels within before increasing between 12-24 h (Figure [F1]). Induction of AtTSPO mRNA by abiotic stresses. (A) Quantitative real-time PCR analyses of AtTspO transcripts upon treatment of different stresses, (a) 150 mM NaCl, (b) 1 μM ABA, (c) 250 mM mannitol and (d) 0.2 μM methyl viologen. Relative expression levels were calculated and ACTIN (At3g18780) and 18S rRNA (At3g41768) here used as reference genes. (B) GUS expression in AtTSPO-437::GUS and LHCB::GUS lines in 15-day-old transgenic Arabidopsis plants either untreated or treated with 150 mM NaCl. To determine if AtTSPO accumulation was a transcriptional response to NaCl stress, a construct, containing 437 bp upstream the putative translational start site of the AtTSPO gene was fused to the uidA reporter gene (AtTSPO-437::GUS), and transformed into plants, allowing in vivo analysis of AtTSPO transcriptional response to stress conditions. AtTSPO-437::GUS was found to be induced by 150 mM NaCl within 3 h of treatment, which is similar to qRT-PCR results of the endogenous gene (Figure [F1]). In control experiments, 150 mM NaCl resulted in a small decrease of expression of LHCB::GUS (Figure [F1]). Together these results suggest that the 437 bp region of AtTSPO promoter is sufficient for transcriptional regulation of TSPO. To determine the function of AtTSPO in vivo, we obtained a T-DNA insertional mutant (SALK_135023) [[B25]] in AtTSPO. This line (tspo-1) was found to have two tandem T-DNA insertions, 123 bp upstream from the translational initiation codon of the AtTSPO gene (Figure [F2]). Homozygous lines were then confirmed to be knock-down mutants by quantitative real time PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis. In this mutant, TSPO mRNA levels are about 20% of wild type (Figure [F2]). Phenotype of mutants with different levels of AtTSPO expression. (A) Schematic representation of isolated insertional mutant of AtTSPO in Arabidopsis. Two copies of the T-DNA were inserted in tandem 123 bp upstream from the translational initiation codon of AtTSPO. (B) Total RNA was isolated from 5 day-old seedlings, reverse-transcribed and subjected to qRT-PCR. Data shown represent mean values obtained from independent amplification reactions (n = 3) and biological replicates (n = 2). Bars represent the standard error of biological replicates. (C) Root lengths of at least 100 individual 7-day-old seedlings grown in 16 h photoperiods. (D) Chlorophyll concentrations in 14-day-old, in vitro-grown plants of the indicated genotypes were determined spectrophotometrically. Values shown are means derived from three independent samples, each sample containing 100 mg of fresh weight. Units are μg of chlorophyll a + b per g of fresh weight (fw). AtTSPO fused or not to the N-terminus of GFP was constitutively overexpressed from the CaMV 35S promoter in transgenic Arabidopsis lines (OxM1TSPO and OxM1TSPO:eGFP). We obtained 10 over-expression lines, but focused on the two homozygous lines that exhibited ~500 fold over-expression of AtTSPO (Figure [F2]). The tspo-1, OxM1TSPO:eGFP and wild-type lines were grown side-by-side on either Murashige & Skoog (MS) agar medium or soil, and were monitored for possible abnormal phenotypes. The knock-down plants had longer roots compared to the wild type and the over-expression lines (Figure [F2]). Moreover, tspo-1 accumulated ~30% less chlorophyll than either the wild type or the overexpression lines in the presence of 150 mM NaCl (Figure [F2]). AtTSPO expression was previously shown to be regulated by osmotic stress in germination and seedling growth assays [[B23]]. Because TSPO regulates the expression of photosynthetic genes in R. sphaeroides [[B16]], we hypothesized that tspo-1 or OxM1TSPO:eGFP mutants might have an impaired salt stress response. We examined the expression of some well-known salt stress-regulated genes (RAB18, ERD10 and DREB2A) [[B26]]. As expected, stress marker genes were induced by 150 mM NaCl in wild-type plants (Figure [F3] and [F3]). In AtTSPO over-expression lines, the levels of DREB2A and RAB18 were lower but no significant change ERD10 expression was observed (Figure [F3] and [F3]). Stress-response genes are up-regulated in tspo-1 during salt stress. (A)-(C) Stress-induced gene expression in OxM1TSPO:eGFP and tspo-1 lines compared to wild type plants, by qPCR. 5-day-old seedlings grown under standard conditions and transferred for 3 hours to plates containing 150 mM NaCl. (A) DREB2A, (B) RAB18 and (C) ERD10 mRNA levels were determined by quantitative qRT-PCR. Relative amounts were calculated and normalized relative to Col-0 non-treated (100%). The ACTIN and 18S rRNA were used as reference genes. ACTIN, At3g18780; 18S RNA, At3g41768; RAB18, At5g66400; ERD10, At1g20450; DREB2A, At5g05410. Data shown represent mean values obtained from independent amplification reactions (n = 3) and biological replicates (n = 2). Relative expression levels were calculated. Bars represent the standard error of biological replicates. In tspo-1 mutants, 3 h of 150 mM NaCl treatment resulted in the increased expression of all three stress marker genes (Figure [F3] and [F3]). Taken together these results show that AtTSPO plays an important role in regulating the expression of stress response genes. Consistent with TSPO transporting tetrapyrroles [[B17],[B19],[B27]], tspo-1 plants accumulated less chlorophyll than wild-type plants (Figure [F2]). Because we found that TSPO is involved in the salt stress response and because TSPO negatively regulates photosynthetic genes in R. sphaeroides [[B17]]. We next analyzed the expression of a few key chlorophyll biosynthesis genes in tspo-1 plants. Initially, we determined the mRNA levels of most of the key genes in the tetrapyrrole pathway (Additional file [S1]) in tspo-1 and gun5 mutants. GUN5 encodes the H subunit of chloroplastic Mg-chelatase, which is involved in the perception of altered levels of tetrapyrrolic intermediates [[B28]]. All tetrapyrrole biosynthetic genes known to be light-dependent [[B29]] were found to be down-regulated in tspo-1, as well as in gun5 mutants [[B28]] (Figure [F4] and [F4]), whereas the expression of the two light-independent genes were unaffected in wild-type and tspo-1 mutant (Figure [F4] and [F4]). Expression of tetrapyrrole biosynthesis genes in tspo-1 mutant. qRT-PCR analyses of tetrapyrrole biosynthesis genes in Col-0, tspo-1 and gun5 5-days-old seedlings grown in constant light. Relative amounts were calculated and normalized relative to Col-0 non-treated (100%). With the exception of HEMA2 and FC1, all the genes have been show to be regulated by light. The data are presented following the enzymes order in the tetrapyrrole biosynthesis. The ACTIN and 18S rRNA genes were used as control. ACTIN, At3g18780; 18S rRNA, At3g41768; (A) HEMA1 (Glutamyl-tRNA reductase 1 - At1g58290) (B) HEMA2 (Glutamyl-tRNA reductase 2 - At1g04490); (C) PPO (Protoporphyrinogen oxidase - At4g01690); (D) FC1 (Ferrochelatase 1 - At5g26030); (E) FC2 (Ferrochelatase 2 - At2g30390); (F) GUN2 (Heme oxygenase 1 - At2g26670); (G) GUN4 (Regulator of Mg-porphyrin synthesis - At3g59400); (H) GUN5 (Mg-chelatase subunit H - At5g13630); (I) CAO (Chlorophyllide A oxygenase - At1g44446); and (J) GUN1 (Pentatricopeptide repeat (PPR) protein - At2g31400). Data shown represent mean values obtained from independent amplification reactions (n = 3) and biological replicates (n = 2). Relative expression levels were calculated. Bars represent the standard error of biological replicates. tspo-1 mutants present reduced levels of light-regulated tetrapyrrole metabolism genes (Figure [F4], and [F4]) and also have low chlorophyll content (Figure [F2]). In order to investigate if decreasing flux of tetrapyrrole intermediates would affect AtTSPO expression in wild-type plants, we used two different drugs that interfere with tetrapyrrole biosynthesis, Gabaculine and Norflurazon. Gabaculine acts as a tetrapyrrole biosynthesis inhibitor by blocking the glutamate-1-semi aldehyde aminotransferase activity [[B30],[B31]]. The herbicide Norflurazon inhibits carotenoid biosynthesis and indirectly affects enzymes in tetrapyrrole biosynthesis [[B32]-[B34]]. AtTSPO mRNA levels increased 2-fold in plants treated with 50 μM of gabaculine and up to 500-fold after 500 nM norflurazon treatment (Figure [F5]). Relationship between tetrapyrrole flux and AtTSPO expression. (A) AtTSPO expression in wild-type plants germinated in 50 μM of gabaculine or 500 nM of norflurazon compared to untreated plants. (B) AtTSPO mRNA levels in different mutants of the tetrapyrrole pathway. Relative amounts were calculated and normalized relative to Col-0 non-treated (100%). The ACTIN and 18S rRNA genes were used as control. ACTIN, At3g18780; 18S RNA, At3g41768. Data shown represent mean values obtained from independent amplification reactions (n = 3) and biological replicates (n = 2). Relative expression levels were calculated. Bars represent the standard error of biological replicates. To explore if AtTSPO expression is affected by genetic alterations of the tetrapyrrole biosynthesis pathway, we analyzed the expression of AtTSPO in different mutant backgrounds (Additional file [S1]). We found that AtTSPO levels are differently altered in various tetrapyrrole pathway mutants. AtTSPO steady-state levels were increased in gun2 (allele of hy1 - required for phytochromobilin synthesis from heme) [[B35]], gun4 (mutant in the Protoporphyrin IX- and Mg-Protoporphyrin IX-binding protein) [[B36]], fc1 (mutant in the ferrochelatase) [[B37]], hemA1hemA2 double mutant (mutant in both glutamyl-tRNA reductases genes) [[B38]] and lin-2 (mutant in the coproporphyrinogen III oxidase) [[B39]] (Figure [F5]). The increased expression of AtTSPO in these mutants with reduced tetrapyrrole levels is consistent with AtTSPO transporting tetrapyrroles for roles in other compartments. The only biosynthetic mutant that resulted in reduced AtTSPO levels was crd1 (mutant in the Mg-protoporphyrin IX monomethyl ester cyclase) [[B40]] (Figure [F5]). All these mutations, in exception of crd1 [[B41]], inhibit somehow ALA synthesis, suggesting that disturbances in tetrapyrrole biosynthesis or accumulation affect AtTSPO mRNA expression. AtTSPO (At2g47770) encodes a protein with a predicted molecular weight of 18 kDa. This protein has three possible in-frame ATG-start codons (M1, M21 and M42) in its N-terminal extension region (Additional file [S2]) [[B19]]. Since reports of plant TSPO localization have resulted in different findings subcellular localization of plant TSPO [[B19],[B21],[B23]] we re-examined the subcellular location of AtTSPO and evaluated the roles of the N-terminal extension in targeting AtTSPO within the cell. Past studies [[B20],[B23]] have utilized N-terminal GFP fusions that might block potential organellar targeting of AtTSPO, particularly mitochondrial or plastid localization. To allow proper targeting of AtTSPO fusions to GFP, AtTSPO was placed on the N-terminus of GFP. Three constructs were made, representing each of the potential start codons M1 (OxM1TSPO:eGFP), M21 (OxM21TSPO:eGFP) and M42 (OxM42TSPO:eGFP) and expressed from the CaMV 35S promoter in Arabidopsis. AtTSPO:eGFP subcellular localization was observed in root, hypocotyls and cotyledons of these lines by confocal microscopy. Full-length AtTSPO:eGFP (OxM1TSPO:eGFP) was found in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) of the root tip (Figure [F6]) and cotyledons (Figure [F6]) in five day-old seedlings. However, in the hypocotyls of these plants, the fusion protein was found in the ER and in vesicles of unknown identity (Figure [F6]). When M21 (OxM21TSPO:eGFP) or M42 (OxM42TSPO:eGFP) were used, the fusion proteins always co-localized with mitotracker, indicating a mitochondrial localization (Figure [F6] and [F6]) (Additional file [S3]). These results corroborate the previous observations of mitochondrial localization of TSPO in D. Lanata leaves by immunogold staining and in Arabidopsis by western blot experiments [[B19]], as well as the endoplasmic reticulum located protein [[B23]], indicating that the alternative use of three initiation codons could be important for AtTSPO localization and its post-translational control. AtTSPO has different sub-cellular location depending on the translational start site used. Confocal images of OxM1TSPO:eGFP (A-C), OxM21TSPO:eGFP (D-F) and OxM42TSPO:eGFP (G-I) localization. OxM1TSPO:eGFP localizes in the ER and vesicles of unknown function in the root (A), hypocotyl (B) and cotyledon (C). OxM21TSPO:eGFP localizes in the mitochondria of root (D), hypocotyl (E) and cotyledon (F). OxM42TSPO:eGFP show mitochondria localization in root (G), hypocotyls (H) and cotyledons (I). GFP fluorescence is represented by green and chlorophyll auto fluorescence in red. The samples were incubated with Mitotracker to identify mitochondria (see Additional file 3). Homozygous transgenic plants harboring 35S-TSPO:eGFP in wild-type background were used for the analysis. Scale bars = 50 μm. Having established a key role for AtTSPO in response to abiotic stress, we next examined the localization of AtTSPO:eGFP fusion proteins in plants subjected to various stress conditions. 5 day-old seedlings were treated with 250 mM mannitol, 1 μM ABA, 0.2 μM MV and 150 mM NaCl. After 18 hours of treatment, OxM1TSPO:eGFP became localized to the plastid (Figure [F7] and [F7]), while neither OxM21TSPO:eGFP nor OxM42TSPO:eGFP had altered localization even with 5 day extended NaCl treatment (data not shown). AtTSPO:GFP localization did not change when plants were treated with mannitol, ABA or MV (data not shown). OxM1TSPOeGFP localizes in chloroplasts upon salt stress. (A-F) Confocal analyses show OxM1TSPO:eGFP localization in the ER and vesicles of unknown function in hypocotyls of 5-day-old seedlings grown in the standard conditions. (G-L) Confocal analyses show OxM1TSPO:eGFP chloroplast localization in hypocotyls of 5-day-old seedlings grown in the presence of 150 mM NaCl. GFP fluorescence channel is represented in green and chlorophyll auto fluorescence channel is represented in red. Homozygous transgenic plants harboring 35S-TSPO:eGFP in wild-type background were used for the analysis. Scale bars = 50 μm. To verify the expression levels of AtTSPO during salt stress, total protein from each lines was immunoblotted with antibodies to GFP (Figure [F8]). In all cases, AtTSPO:GFP protein was found to increase significantly after 24h of salt treatment. Accumulation of AtTSPO:GFP was dependent on the presence of AtTSPO because empty vector controls using CaMV or Ubiquitin 10 [[B42]] promoters to drive the expression of GFP did not change in response to salt stress (Figure [F8] and not shown). These results indicate that AtTSPO accumulation is regulated at the transcriptional, post-transcriptional and post-translational levels. AtTSPO accumulation and chloroplast localization upon salt stress. (A) Immunoblot analysis of OxAtTSPO:eGFP (OxM1TSPO:eGFP, OxM21TSPO:eGFP and OxM42TSPO:eGFP) fusion proteins detected in plants with an antibody to GFP. Plants were untreated, or treated with 150 mM NaCl. As a control wild-type plants and plants over-expressing GFP (OxeGFP) seedlings were used. (B) Anti-GFP immunoblot of trypsinized chloroplasts from Arabidopsis plants either untreated or treated with 150 mM NaCl. Control immunoblots were probed with antibodies chloroplast proteins RuBisCo and D1; and to cytosolic UGPase. Each lane represents equal amounts of chloroplasts. To confirm the location of AtTSPO we performed protease protection assays on isolated chloroplasts from OxM1TSPO:eGFP lines that were grown with or without 150 mM NaCl treatment. Following chloroplast isolation and protease protection, equal quantities of chloroplasts were subjected to immunoblotting with antibodies to GFP. AtTSPO was detected in chloroplast fractions near its predicted monomeric molecular mass (Additional file [S4] and [S5]) in plants treated 18 hours with 150 mM NaCl, but not in untreated plants (Figure [F8]). Chloroplasts prepared from OxTSPO:eGFP lines occasionally displayed a lower molecular mass band that is approximately the mass of GFP. This band probably results from proteolysis between AtTSPO and the GFP tag during sample preparation, although we cannot rule out other possibilities since we do not have an antibody to AtTSPO protein itself. Antibodies to RuBisCo and D1 confirmed the integrity and presence of chloroplasts following protease protection. Antibodies to the cytosolic protein UGPase also verified these fractions were free of cytoplasmic contamination (Additional file [S5]). These data together with confocal microscopy indicate that the region between the M1 and M21 is important for targeting AtTSPO to chloroplasts during salt stress. Since AtTSPO was protected from trypsin digestion (Figure [F8]), AtTSPO may be integral to the chloroplast outer envelope.
!~MM~! Arabidopsis thaliana seeds ecotype Col-0 were surface sterilized and plated on MS1/2 medium [[B61]] with or without 50 mM kanamycin. Seedlings were maintained for three days at 4°C and than grown under 16/8 hours light/dark cycles at 23°C in growth chambers. Root length measurements were conducted using plants grown on vertically oriented in standard conditions for 10 days. For abiotic stress treatment, 150 mM NaCl, 250 mM mannitol, 1 μM ABA (Sigma; St Louis, MO) or 0.2 μM paraquat was added to MS1/2 agar plates, and the 5-day-old seedlings were incubated under normal growth condition. For Norflurazon or Gabaculine experiments seeds were plated on MS1/2 containing 1 or 2% sucrose with or without 5 μM norflurazon (Sandoz Pharmaceuticals; Vienna, Austria) or 50 μM of gabaculine (Sigma, USA). All experiments were repeated three times independently and the average was calculated. Total RNA was isolated using Spectrum™ Plant Total RNA Kit (Sigma #STRN250-1KT), according to manufacturer's instructions. One microgram of total RNA was added to each cDNA synthesis reaction using the First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (#K1611). For qRT-PCR, DNA amplification was performed in the presence of SYBR® Green qPCR Detection (Invitrogen) in a MyIQ™ Single Color Real-Time PCR Detection System (BioRad), using the primer pairs at table [T1]. The cycle use was: 95 C, 1 min and 30 sec; 40 × (95 C, 10 sec; 60 C, 1 min); 95 C, 1 min; 60 C, 1 min and 81 × (60 C, 10 sec). The relative mRNA levels were determined by normalizing the PCR threshold cycle number with Actin and 18S RNA. All experiments were repeated three times independently and the average was calculated. Primers used for quantitative real time PCR (qRT-PCR) The tspo-1 T-DNA mutant, SALK_135023, was obtained from the Salk collection [[B24]]. Homozygous mutants were isolated by PCR-based genotyping using gene specific PCR primers AtTSPO-LP and AtTSPO-BP together with LBa1 (Table [T2]). Only homozygous lines were used for the phenotypic investigation. Primers used for cloning and genotyping The 437 bp upstream of the translational star site of the AtTSPO gene (At2g47770) was translational fused into uidA gene in pKGWFS7 vector by Gateway® (Invitrogen™) [[B62]] and introduced into Arabidopsis via Agrobacterium-mediated transformation [[B63]]. For cloning primers and constructs information see Tables [T2] and [T3], respectively. For histochemical GUS expression plant samples were soaked at 37°C for 16 hours in GUS assay solution (1 mm 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolylglucronide, 0.5 mm K3Fe(CN)6, 0.5 mm K4Fe(CN)6, 0.3% (v/v) Triton X-100, 20% (v/v) methanol, and 50 mm inorganic phosphate-buffered saline). The reaction was further conducted at 37°C in the dark for a maximum of 16 hours. Constructs information For the GFP fusion constructs, clones containing the coding region of AtTSPO as well as fusions starting at methionine 21 and 42 were generated and cloned into pK7FWG2 [[B62]] (Table [T3]) according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen, CA, USA). Primers used were: AtTSPO M1: TSPO NT1 and TSPO CT1; AtTSPO M2: TSPO NT2 and TSPO CT1; AtTSPO M3: TSPO NT3 and TSPO CT1; AtTSPO 80aa: TSPO NT1 and TSPO CT80 (Table [T2]). Arabidopsis thaliana was observed in a confocal laser scanning microscope Leica DM IRE2 (Leica microsystems). For the mitochondrial-specific staining, Arabidopsis seedlings were incubated in MitoTracker® Red CMXRos (Invitrogen, #M7512) according to manufactures instructions. Excitation and emission wavelengths were 488 and 505-530 nm (BP 505-530 filter) for GFP and, 543 and 560-615 nm (BP 560-615 filter) for MitoTracker® respectively. All images were processed on Leica DM IRE2 Image Browser program (Leica microsystems). Seedlings at 10 days after germination were weighted, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and ground in 80% (v/v) acetone. Ground tissue was centrifuged at 2,000 g for 5 min to pellet any insoluble material. The absorbance of the extracted chlorophyll at 645 and 663 nm was then determined. Chlorophyll (a and b) contents of the samples were determined according to Lichtenthaler [[B64]]. Isolation of chloroplasts from plate-grown Arabidopsis seedlings was performed as described previously [[B65]]. Final resuspension of chloroplast was in buffer (330 mM sorbitol, 50 mM HEPES-KOH, pH 8.0) at a concentration of 1 mg chlorophyll ml-1. Total protein was extracted from 10-day-old seedlings by adding protein extraction buffer (50 mM HEPES pH 7.9, 300 mM Sucrose, 150 mM NaCl, 10 mM Potassium acetate, protease inhibitors cocktail - Roche, 1% (w/v) Triton, 1 mM DTT). Ground tissue was centrifuged at 5,000 × g for 5 min to pellet the tissue and proteins were quantify by Bradford assay [[B66]]. Samples were boiled for 5 min in 250 mM Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 10% (w/v) SDS, 30% (v/v) glycerol, 5% (v/v) β- mercaptoethanol and 0.02% (w/v) bromophenol blue. SDS-PAGE was performed using standard procedures. Chloroplast protein samples were normalized loaded by equal amounts of total chlorophyll. Following SDS-PAGE, the separated proteins were transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Bio-Rad). For immunodetection, membranes were incubated with antibody against GFP (ROCHE, #11814460001), UGPase (AGRISERA, #AS05086), RuBisCo (AGRISERA, #AS03037) and D1(AGRISERA, #AS05084). With the exception of GFP detection that uses mouse secondary antibody, all the immunoreactive proteins were detected by using rabbit secondary antibody. The immunoreaction was detected by chemiluminescence kit (Thermo Scientific, #34076) according to manufacturer's instructions.
